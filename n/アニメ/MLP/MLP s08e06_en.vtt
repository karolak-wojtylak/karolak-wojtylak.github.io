WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:05.905
Princess Twilight!

00:06.207 --> 00:07.758
WE'RE GLOWING!

00:07.859 --> 00:11.010
[giggle] That's what happens
when you're summoned by the map.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.545
Somepony needs our help?

00:13.647 --> 00:15.747
We're being called by the map?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.483
Did I mention we're glowing?

00:21.222 --> 00:23.956
So where exactly in
Equestria are we needed?

00:24.058 --> 00:26.859
Actually, where you're going
isn't even in Equestria.

00:27.461 --> 00:31.063
Wow. That's almost...
off the table!

00:31.265 --> 00:33.065
But.. what's way out there?

00:33.467 --> 00:34.366
Mt. Aris.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.035
The home of the Hippogriffs.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.970
And that's where you're headed.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.472
Whooaaaa.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.051
You really don't need to
come with us, Twilight!

01:26.153 --> 01:28.554
We can take care of this
mission just fine on our own!

01:28.756 --> 01:29.488
Mm-hm!

01:29.690 --> 01:30.656
Scootaloo: YEAH!

01:32.092 --> 01:32.958
Ugh!

01:37.765 --> 01:38.697
I know that.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.232
But I'm not so sure the ponies

01:40.334 --> 01:41.733
who care about you
want you going off

01:41.869 --> 01:42.935
so far on your own.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.170
Besides, there's
some school business

01:45.272 --> 01:46.906
I need to take care
of on Mt. Aris.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.310
This permission slip
is for Silverstream.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.712
It's very important that her
mother and father sign it,

01:54.014 --> 01:55.848
or else no field trips!

01:56.550 --> 01:59.618
Sounds like somepony
just wants a vacation.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.089
OK, yes, I have been
wanting to visit Mt. Aris

02:04.191 --> 02:05.891
ever since the
Hippogriffs moved back.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.460
But it's... purely research.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.896
Silverstream's brother is
going to meet us there,

02:10.998 --> 02:12.298
and take us to their houses.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.365
Wow!

02:13.467 --> 02:15.401
They have more than one house?

02:15.703 --> 02:16.553
I guess so.

02:16.754 --> 02:18.704
The social structure of the
Hippogriffs and Seaponies

02:18.806 --> 02:20.272
is a bit of a mystery.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.707
All aboard!

02:21.809 --> 02:24.509
Last stop, the new
Mt. Aris station!

02:38.325 --> 02:40.559
I don't know if I'd
like being a Hippogriff.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.928
Part bird, part pony...

02:43.130 --> 02:45.665
I'm happy with just
my pony parts, thanks.

02:46.067 --> 02:48.167
I think Hippogriffs
are pretty neat.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.135
I learned all about
them from Applejack.

02:50.337 --> 02:54.073
The Hippogriffs all once
lived happily on Mt. Aris...

02:54.275 --> 02:55.975
but when the
Storm King invaded,

02:56.077 --> 02:58.944
they used a Magic Pearl
to turn into Sea Ponies

02:59.046 --> 03:02.381
and escaped to the underwater
safety of Seaquestria.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.451
Then, in the Battle
of Canterlot,

03:05.553 --> 03:07.453
when Applejack defeated
the Storm King.

03:07.555 --> 03:10.489
Twilight: Wait, what? She
told you SHE defeated him?

03:10.591 --> 03:11.624
By herself?

03:11.826 --> 03:15.294
Uh. Maybe she didn't
say that exactly,

03:15.396 --> 03:17.229
but it makes for a
better story.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.766
Conductor: Final stop,
Mt. Aris station!

03:21.869 --> 03:22.335
Huh!

03:42.156 --> 03:45.190
All right. So what kind of cutie
mark-related friendship problem

03:45.292 --> 03:46.692
do you think we're
supposed to solve?

03:46.894 --> 03:49.461
I don't know, but hippogriffs
don't HAVE cutie marks,

03:49.763 --> 03:51.997
so it might not have anything
to do with that at all.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.703
Huh. Still the map called us,

03:57.805 --> 04:01.272
so it must be a kind of problem
that only we can solve!

04:02.609 --> 04:04.677
GO CRUSADERS!

04:05.279 --> 04:08.180
But how do we know exactly
who we're supposed to help?

04:09.883 --> 04:10.849
AHEM!

04:11.051 --> 04:12.918
Attention, please!

04:13.120 --> 04:15.153
Anygriff here have a problem?

04:22.196 --> 04:23.596
Eh. That's all I got.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.597
Maybe if the map could be

04:25.699 --> 04:27.666
a little more specific
about our mission?

04:27.868 --> 04:29.835
Like maybe an address?

04:30.137 --> 04:32.137
The map doesn't
really work like that.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.206
But I'm sure you, and
whoever needs help,

04:34.308 --> 04:35.541
will find each other.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.384
Excuse me, Miss
Sparkle? Over here!

04:45.786 --> 04:46.685
Sorry I'm late.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.353
I'm Silverstream's brother.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.255
Terramar.

04:49.557 --> 04:52.324
A Hippogriff can have a
Sea Pony for a brother?

04:52.526 --> 04:54.326
How does that work, exactly?

04:54.428 --> 04:57.028
Sssh! It's rude to ask
a question like that!

04:59.466 --> 05:00.632
Whoa!

05:03.637 --> 05:04.770
Can I ask now?

05:05.072 --> 05:06.939
Heh. It is kind of strange.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.374
See, after the Storm
King was defeated,

05:09.476 --> 05:11.443
the Sea Ponies didn't
have to hide anymore.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.278
So some of them changed
back to Hippogriffs

05:13.380 --> 05:14.813
and went home to Mt. Aris.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.715
But others got used to
living under the water

05:16.817 --> 05:18.451
and stayed in Seaquestria.

05:19.253 --> 05:22.287
And me, well, I kind
of go back and forth.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.255
With this.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.958
It's a tiny piece
of the Magic Pearl.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.826
It was split up
among our kingdoms.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.629
Cool!

05:30.031 --> 05:32.664
Well, I'm pretty eager to
see the Hippogriff village.

05:32.966 --> 05:37.303
You know, to get this form
signed, and research, so...

05:37.905 --> 05:40.739
Hey Terramar, does anygriff you
know up there have a problem

05:40.841 --> 05:42.107
they need help with?

05:42.209 --> 05:43.842
[chuckle] On Mt. Aris?

05:43.944 --> 05:46.378
No, everygriff is
pretty happy up there.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.981
It's a great place to live.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.290
Whoa!

05:58.492 --> 06:00.359
This looks amazing!

06:00.561 --> 06:02.694
Last time I was here,
it was a ghost town!

06:02.796 --> 06:04.896
Yeah! Queen Novo thought
it was important

06:04.998 --> 06:07.433
to return our village
to its former glory.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.780
And now, I
officially open

06:21.882 --> 06:25.284
the "Glad to Be A Hippogriff
Festival!"

06:54.114 --> 06:57.049
Wow! We picked a
good day to show up!

06:57.451 --> 06:58.450
Not really.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.486
We do this every weekend.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.588
Hippogriffs REALLY
like being hippogriffs.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.129
Heh. There's my boy!

07:10.731 --> 07:11.530
Hi, Dad!

07:12.766 --> 07:14.633
Haven't seen you
in days, Son!

07:14.735 --> 07:16.335
Wish you'd come
around more often.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.938
Oh, Dad, these are
Silverstream's friends

07:19.040 --> 07:20.872
from Equestria,
they came up to--

07:20.974 --> 07:23.709
[gasp] Princess Twilight Sparkle!

07:27.848 --> 07:29.681
Attention, Everygriff!

07:29.783 --> 07:32.084
Princess Twilight
Sparkle is here!

07:32.486 --> 07:34.553
She's Silverstream's teacher!

07:41.295 --> 07:44.729
Here to take in the marvel that
is Mt. Aris, Your Highness?

07:44.831 --> 07:46.198
Absolutely!

07:46.300 --> 07:48.534
And to have you sign a
form for Silverstream.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.636
Glad to! But first,
let's show the princess

07:51.738 --> 07:54.239
some real Mt. Aris
hospitality.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.809
To the refreshment tent,
for a stein of salmon juice!

08:00.080 --> 08:02.347
Eh! Research! See you later!

08:02.449 --> 08:03.282
And good luck!

08:03.384 --> 08:05.017
I know you'll find your mission!

08:05.719 --> 08:09.888
Well, your dad's
certainly...outgoing, isn't he?

08:10.090 --> 08:11.056
He's a great guy.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.757
All my relatives are nice.

08:12.859 --> 08:13.658
That's kind of the problem...

08:13.760 --> 08:14.693
Wait, stop!

08:15.796 --> 08:17.797
What's that
wonderful sound?

08:18.499 --> 08:19.931
Those are the
Harmonizing Heights.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.366
Legend says that--

08:40.754 --> 08:44.489
WOOHOO! YEAH! AWESOME!
I LOVE THIS!

08:44.991 --> 08:47.059
Uh... is she OK?

08:48.061 --> 08:50.729
This is absolutely
the BEST place EVER!

08:50.931 --> 08:52.364
You are SO LUCKY!

08:52.466 --> 08:54.399
AND you get to
swim in the ocean!

08:54.501 --> 08:56.702
You have TWO great
places to live!

08:57.004 --> 08:59.605
How do you make up your
mind which one to stay in?

09:00.207 --> 09:01.340
I can't.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.709
That's the problem.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.044
Did you say.. problem?

09:06.146 --> 09:07.946
<i> You</i> have a problem!?

09:09.049 --> 09:09.815
Yes!

09:14.955 --> 09:16.188
Sweetie Belle: Whoo hoo!

09:17.290 --> 09:18.657
We discovered our mission!

09:18.759 --> 09:19.824
All right!

09:19.926 --> 09:21.026
We did it!

09:21.128 --> 09:22.627
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

09:24.665 --> 09:26.031
Heh heh. Sorry.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.766
You were talking
about your problem?

09:28.068 --> 09:32.004
Right. Like I said, Mt. Aris
is one great place to live.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.406
That's why Silverstream
and my dad

09:34.508 --> 09:36.408
and some of my cousins
came back here.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.811
But Seaquestria is ANOTHER
great place to live.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.380
That's where my mom is.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.350
Oh. I-I didn't know that.

09:45.152 --> 09:48.520
So no matter where I am, I feel
like I'm letting someone down.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.990
No wonder you're having
such a hard time deciding.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.692
And I have to choose soon.

09:53.794 --> 09:57.028
Every other 'Griff my age
already KNOWS where they belong.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.630
I'm still not sure.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.000
When in doubt,
chart it out!

10:04.671 --> 10:07.639
Now, we put down everything
great about each place...

10:07.741 --> 10:09.208
and everything not so great.

10:09.410 --> 10:13.211
Compare them, and your
decision is made for you!

10:13.413 --> 10:15.146
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

10:15.248 --> 10:17.883
Mt. Aris is the best of
all possible worlds.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.951
Pro: It's beautiful!

10:20.153 --> 10:22.254
Con: Too far from Equestria.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.222
I think that pretty
much sums it up.

10:26.593 --> 10:29.194
But, you haven't BEEN
to Seaquestria yet.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.896
How can you even compare them?

10:31.398 --> 10:32.964
Terramar's right, Sweetie Belle.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.934
It'd be more fair if we visit
both places before we decide.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.571
Hey, everypony!

10:39.773 --> 10:41.773
This festival is FANTASTIC!

10:41.875 --> 10:43.742
Look what I won at
the ring toss booth!

10:45.913 --> 10:50.182
Ahem! But of course, I'm
really here on business.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.117
Sky Beak's already
signed the form,

10:52.219 --> 10:53.952
now I just need your
mom's signature.

10:54.054 --> 10:54.787
Is she around?

10:55.689 --> 10:58.023
Um, she's a Sea Pony.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.925
In Seaquestria.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.328
That's what Silverstream
meant by "houses."

11:03.530 --> 11:05.830
Mm-hm! If you'd like
to meet my mom,

11:05.932 --> 11:07.299
we're just heading
down there now.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.735
And, how exactly are we
going to visit underwater?

11:19.946 --> 11:21.279
Wow!

11:22.983 --> 11:24.015
Woooo-hooooo!

11:24.417 --> 11:25.416
Yeah!

11:26.386 --> 11:27.152
Whoa.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.890
This must be JUST LIKE FLYING!

11:32.092 --> 11:33.526
WOO-HOO!

11:34.628 --> 11:36.395
Where's your mom's
house, Terramar?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.298
Come on, it's this way!

11:39.600 --> 11:41.299
This is awesome!

11:58.051 --> 11:58.717
Mom!

11:59.019 --> 12:00.085
Terramar!

12:00.187 --> 12:01.653
Welcome home, baby!

12:01.755 --> 12:05.023
No excuses, this time
you're staying for dinner!

12:05.325 --> 12:08.093
Scootaloo, Sweetie
Belle, Apple Bloom?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.228
This is my mom, Ocean Flow.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.362
And this is--

12:11.464 --> 12:14.099
[gasp] Princess
Twilight Sparkle!

12:14.201 --> 12:15.400
What an honor!

12:15.502 --> 12:18.670
You know, Silverstream
just raves about you!

12:18.772 --> 12:21.907
Well, she is one of our
most hard-working students.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.209
In fact, I brought this
form for you to sign, so that--

12:24.311 --> 12:26.611
Both my children
are so smart!

12:26.713 --> 12:28.513
Would you like to see
their baby pictures?

12:28.715 --> 12:29.615
MOM!

12:30.117 --> 12:33.352
That sounds adorable;
I'd love to!

12:33.454 --> 12:36.788
And, you know, to find out about
aquatic pony early development

12:36.890 --> 12:37.856
and uh--

12:38.058 --> 12:40.326
[laughter] Research!

12:41.228 --> 12:42.894
Oh, well maybe your
friends would like a snack

12:42.996 --> 12:43.895
while we're gone?

12:43.997 --> 12:44.996
Some kelp chips?

12:45.098 --> 12:45.997
Fish oil tea?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.132
No thanks, Mom.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.633
I'm gonna go show
them around.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.039
Scootaloo: Look out!

12:57.244 --> 12:58.343
Can't catch me!

12:59.846 --> 13:03.215
Hmph. Not much sunlight
down here, is there?

13:07.187 --> 13:08.720
Boom bada boom bada boom bada

13:08.822 --> 13:10.989
boom bada boom bada
boom bada boom!

13:13.594 --> 13:17.028
No grass to run in and no
hooves to run on it with...

13:17.430 --> 13:20.832
And excuse me, but how do you
keep from getting all pruney?

13:27.708 --> 13:32.210
[gurgling] Everything
sounds funny down here!

13:35.248 --> 13:37.282
OK, I've seen
everything I need to.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.318
So uh, why don't we
find Twilight Sparkle,

13:40.420 --> 13:42.954
finish the chart, and uh,
head back up the mountain?

13:43.156 --> 13:45.156
I have some serious
field-twirling to do.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.393
Where's she going?

13:48.495 --> 13:50.461
I wanna stay and
swim some more!

14:01.675 --> 14:03.441
Princess Twilight,
you're back!

14:03.543 --> 14:06.111
And just in time for the
Screeching Competition!

14:06.513 --> 14:07.278
Why not?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.480
Could be another
trophy in my future!

14:09.582 --> 14:10.715
Be back soon!

14:14.421 --> 14:15.287
All right.

14:15.389 --> 14:18.056
Let's add some positives
to the Seaquestria side...

14:18.358 --> 14:19.157
Uh-huh!

14:20.660 --> 14:24.062
Swimming is like flying,
multi-color fish, and,

14:24.164 --> 14:25.664
did I mention the flying thing?

14:26.666 --> 14:27.733
You forgot the cons.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.936
Dark, wet, sea monsters.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.405
I don't remember
any sea monsters.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.573
Apple Bloom, looks
like it's up to you.

14:35.675 --> 14:39.811
Me? Well, both places have a
lot of good things about them.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.682

Terramar! Where are you going?

16:53.046 --> 16:56.114
UGH! If you all can't even
agree amongst yourselves.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.517
How am I supposed
to make up my mind?

16:58.919 --> 17:00.051
It's hopeless.

17:09.195 --> 17:09.761
Hmph!

17:09.863 --> 17:11.095
Sweetie Belle
said to tell you

17:11.197 --> 17:13.398
it's your fault that
Terramar ran off.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.634
Well, you tell Sweetie Belle
that if it weren't for her,

17:16.736 --> 17:18.803
our mission would
have been over by now.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.538
And a success!

17:21.240 --> 17:21.907
Hmph.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.143
Scootaloo says this whole
thing is your fault.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.947
Well, tell her that I'm not the
one who dashed all of Terramar's

17:29.049 --> 17:31.116
hopes and made him
give up on the world.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.418
Both worlds.

17:34.220 --> 17:34.819
Hmph.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.622
Sweetie Belle says it's your
fault that Terramar ra--

17:38.024 --> 17:40.525
Oh, wait, I already told
you that, didn't I?

17:40.927 --> 17:42.627
Uh, what's going on?

17:43.129 --> 17:44.129
Where's Terramar?

17:45.231 --> 17:48.666
Uh. Well, he...kind of left.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.368
He wanted to be by himself.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.569
Which was not my fault.

17:51.871 --> 17:52.937
Mine either!

17:53.139 --> 17:55.540
Well, of course not! Why
would you think that?

17:58.111 --> 18:00.145
Because it was our fault!

18:00.947 --> 18:04.082
All we had to do was help him
choose which world to live in.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.485
And we let him down.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.487
Who ever said that
he had to choose?

18:09.889 --> 18:11.189
Well...he did.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.290
Hmmm...

18:12.392 --> 18:14.926
Maybe Terramar is making it
harder than it has to be.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.427
Yoo-hoo!

18:16.629 --> 18:18.163
Princess!

18:18.565 --> 18:22.600
We're having a seashell crafting
circle; care to join us?

18:22.702 --> 18:24.202
Actually we're right
in the middle of--

18:24.304 --> 18:25.203
There you are!

18:25.305 --> 18:27.572
The flag folding ceremony
is about to begin!

18:27.874 --> 18:29.140
Thank you, really.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.776
I've had a great time in
both places today, but...

18:32.078 --> 18:35.446
[softly] Wow! This must be how
Terramar feels all the time!

18:36.148 --> 18:36.815
Oh.

18:36.917 --> 18:38.283
Hello, Sky Beak!

18:38.785 --> 18:39.684
Ocean Flow.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.419
Heh. You're looking well!

18:51.863 --> 18:54.832
Hm... This gives me an idea.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.315
Huh. I thought for sure
he came this way.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.951
[gasp] He did.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.786
And I'm staying here, too.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.823
That way, I don't have to
be on land or in the water.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.958
We're sorry.

19:20.060 --> 19:22.160
We were supposed
to help you, and...

19:22.262 --> 19:24.362
We just ended up
confusing you more.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.631
It's all our fault.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.699
Oh, great.

19:27.901 --> 19:30.168
You're sorry, and
I'm still confused.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.802
I'm staying in my tree.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.308
We might have something
worth coming down for.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.712
We thought we'd get
everycreature together

19:41.814 --> 19:43.548
for a picnic on the beach.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.384
And we mean EVERYCREATURE.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.472
Son! There you are!

20:07.774 --> 20:09.874
Your friends told us how
you've been feeling...

20:10.476 --> 20:12.243
and we're sorry if we
ever made you think

20:12.345 --> 20:14.345
you had to choose
between worlds.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.514
That wasn't our
intention, honey.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.419
Your Hippogriff heritage is
something to be proud of,

20:21.621 --> 20:22.653
certainly...

20:22.855 --> 20:24.789
...but you're more than
just where you're from,

20:24.891 --> 20:26.090
or who you live with.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.393
We love you because you're you.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.595
No matter where
you choose to be.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.630
You don't have to decide.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.999
You can keep doing
what you've been doing,

20:35.201 --> 20:37.102
going back and forth.

20:37.504 --> 20:40.371
And enjoying both places.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.720
Something we forgot to
add that both places have.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.855
Family and friends who love you.

20:59.826 --> 21:00.491
Thanks.

21:00.693 --> 21:01.493
For everything.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.662
Hey, uh...are you glowing?

21:06.699 --> 21:07.498
Yes!

21:07.600 --> 21:08.599
We did it!

21:08.901 --> 21:10.168
Congratulations!

21:10.270 --> 21:12.604
Your first map-
mission is a success.

21:13.006 --> 21:15.373
Guess that means we're
officially done here.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.875
I hope you come visit your
sister in Equestria.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.078
Yeah! Come see us!
You'll love it!

21:20.280 --> 21:22.513
Who knows, you might want
even want to live there!

21:23.950 --> 21:25.249
Yeah, that was a joke.
