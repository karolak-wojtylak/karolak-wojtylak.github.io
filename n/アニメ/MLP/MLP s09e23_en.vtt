WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:05.070
[sigh] I just wanted everything
to be perfect.

00:05.172 --> 00:07.506
I mean, this was
a BIG DEAL!

00:07.608 --> 00:09.741
But when Discord insists
on being involved...

00:09.843 --> 00:11.576
Regardless of what
Spike might say,

00:11.678 --> 00:13.679
that little dragon
BEGGED me to help.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.648
And let me tell you, he
can cause plenty of chaos

00:16.750 --> 00:18.917
all on his
purple lonesome!

00:19.019 --> 00:22.421
I PRIDE myself on baking
under pressure but I just...

00:22.523 --> 00:23.723
Oh, dear.

00:24.325 --> 00:27.326
You'd think we'd be used to
stuff like this in Ponyville.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.228
I still have
nightmares.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.364
It seemed simple
when it started..

00:34.536 --> 00:38.237
Oh! It's BEAUTIFUL!

00:38.339 --> 00:39.505
Eeyup!

00:41.208 --> 00:41.841
NOPE!

00:41.943 --> 00:43.509
I'm not gonna EAT it!

00:43.911 --> 00:44.777
Eat what?

00:47.214 --> 00:47.980
What is it!

00:48.082 --> 00:49.281
I wanna see!

00:49.383 --> 00:50.216
Nope!

00:50.318 --> 00:51.417
Why not?

00:51.519 --> 00:53.319
Because you have
a big mouth.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.486
ME?

00:54.988 --> 00:56.722
I keep TONS
of secrets!

00:56.824 --> 00:59.459
Like Fluttershy's
secret fear of clowns,

00:59.561 --> 01:03.696
or that time I caught Twilight
sleeptrotting through town.

01:03.798 --> 01:07.199
Oh, and did you know that
Octavia went on a date

01:07.301 --> 01:12.238
with Bulk Biceps? Talk about
an odd couple! I heard that...

01:12.540 --> 01:15.074
Oh. All right,
point taken.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.842
But we're
pals, right?

01:16.944 --> 01:18.944
COMRADES. AMIGOS!

01:19.346 --> 01:20.912
COME ON!

01:27.288 --> 01:31.223
BIG MAC IS GOING TO
PROPOSE TO SUGAR BELLE?

01:31.325 --> 01:33.926
[echo] SUGAR BELLE!
SUGAR BELLE!

02:14.735 --> 02:17.536
Of course, Big Mac asked ME
to help with his proposal;

02:17.638 --> 02:19.805
I'm the most romantic
dragon I know.

02:20.007 --> 02:23.174
Oh! It really is a curse
having infinite powers.

02:23.276 --> 02:24.976
Everypony's
always asking you

02:25.078 --> 02:26.645
to move a couch

02:26.747 --> 02:29.214
or help with
a proposal.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.818
Spill it!
EVERY detail!

02:32.920 --> 02:34.052
Don't leave
anything out!

02:34.154 --> 02:36.755
Agh! Do we have to
hear ALL the details?

02:36.857 --> 02:39.891
Is that like, a
<i>friend</i> thing?

02:40.093 --> 02:42.160
[sigh] Eyup.

02:45.466 --> 02:50.502
I don't talk much so I
want to SHOW Sugar Belle

02:50.604 --> 02:54.338
how committed
I am. First...

02:57.610 --> 02:59.943
[gasp] You're making a picnic table
that matches the shelf

03:00.045 --> 03:01.078
you made Sugar
Belle for her shop

03:01.180 --> 03:01.946
when you had a
crush on her

03:02.048 --> 03:03.214
and you're setting
up a romantic meal

03:03.316 --> 03:04.783
overlooking Sweet
Apple Acres!?

03:04.885 --> 03:05.785
Eyup!

03:05.987 --> 03:07.953
Uh. How did you
figure that out?

03:08.255 --> 03:09.521
If you were a
hopeless romantic,

03:09.623 --> 03:11.556
you'd know that was the
only logical choice.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.358
Then...

03:16.129 --> 03:18.429
You painted apples to
leave around Ponyville

03:18.531 --> 03:20.031
with little riddles
tied to the stem

03:20.133 --> 03:22.067
that will lead her
up here to meet you?

03:22.169 --> 03:23.068
Eyup.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.469
Seriously?

03:24.571 --> 03:26.938
Now...
-Yeah--

03:27.040 --> 03:30.141
Oh, I know! You need a
giant rhino named Delores

03:30.243 --> 03:33.011
who can knit a romantic
sweater for two!

03:33.113 --> 03:35.647
Uh... Nope.

03:37.318 --> 03:40.885
Come on! He needs food for
the picnic. That was a gimme.

03:42.289 --> 03:44.089
I do not get
this game.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.991
OK. You finish
your table...

03:46.093 --> 03:47.459
I'll pick up whatever
you need to eat

03:47.561 --> 03:49.528
and Discord will put
all the apples in place.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.529
I will?

03:50.631 --> 03:51.430
Eeyup!

04:05.145 --> 04:08.580
From the Sugarcube Corner,
look for your next clue.

04:08.682 --> 04:11.216
Red, delicious,
sweet like you.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.618
Find it; you'll
know what to do...?

04:13.720 --> 04:14.720
Ugh.

04:15.322 --> 04:17.422
He should stick
to bucking apples.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.724
Sugar Belle's
gonna love it!

04:26.533 --> 04:27.299
I'll get the food.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.367
How long will it take you
to place all the apples?

04:30.804 --> 04:33.338
Are you sure you put
them in the right spots?

04:33.640 --> 04:35.707
Those terrible
riddles on the apples

04:35.809 --> 04:38.076
were VERY clear
on the location.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.245
I'm sure that they
were placed properly.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.916
I-I think. Maybe.
Does it matter?

04:46.253 --> 04:49.087
Oh, OK fine! I'll
double check.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.561
She didn't see the apple!
What are we gonna do!?

04:56.663 --> 04:58.864
Well, we could just
GIVE it to her.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.566
That's not romantic! She
needs to discover it.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.802
Don't be such a
drama dragon.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.771
I've precipitated liquid
cocoa on Equestria,

05:06.873 --> 05:08.974
and herded long-limbed
Leporidae;

05:09.076 --> 05:12.978
I can certainly make
a pony SEE an apple.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.752
Hey Mrs. Cake. I need
to pick up a few things.

05:22.389 --> 05:24.155
Oh, I'm afraid
you'll have to wait.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.824
I'm a bit busy
at the moment!

05:25.926 --> 05:28.493
Oh, is this sour
cream or sweet cream?

05:30.697 --> 05:32.764
Oh, it's kind
of important...

05:32.966 --> 05:35.033
Maybe I could take some
of these off your hooves?

05:35.435 --> 05:39.104
NO! Those are for...
something important too!

05:39.306 --> 05:41.940
All of them? There's...
one, two, three, four..

05:42.042 --> 05:44.843
Twenty-ONE and
yes all of them.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.545
Who needs twenty-one
desserts?

05:46.647 --> 05:49.981
I can't tell you! It's
a secret. Come by later.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.350
Later won't work!

05:51.852 --> 05:52.751
Why not?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.954
I can't tell you!
It's a secret.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.088
Put the vanilla in
the... with the...

05:57.190 --> 06:00.792
UGH! Did somepony
else bake these?

06:01.094 --> 06:03.094
No. Why..?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.195
No reason..

06:14.475 --> 06:16.775

You know, if she's
too busy to read

06:24.451 --> 06:26.851
the horribly
written clues..

06:26.953 --> 06:28.653
Maybe you should
just tell her.

06:38.833 --> 06:43.368
[gravelly voice]
Listen up, each of
you has a job to do.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.936
Take a look at
your stems.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.707
Well, tell me about it.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.543
But regardless, go to your
designated location,

06:51.645 --> 06:55.580
deliver your messages and
make me proud! Dismissed!

06:59.386 --> 07:02.187
Oh. I just have to say Big
Mac is REALLY lucky

07:02.289 --> 07:03.755
to have me as a friend.

07:09.229 --> 07:13.365
[nervous voice] OK... One
down. Twenty to go.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.667
THEN I can help you.

07:16.469 --> 07:18.269
Maybe I can help YOU!

07:19.606 --> 07:21.172
Delivering parchments
is my thing!

07:21.274 --> 07:23.108
A little dragon
breath and FWOOSH!

07:23.210 --> 07:25.210
We "deliver" each scroll
into each dessert!

07:25.312 --> 07:26.644

Hurry, there's no

the next apple is
at the boutique!

07:48.634 --> 07:50.935
At Twilight's
castle take a right.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.972
The next apple sits
in plain sight!

07:56.043 --> 07:58.043
What in the blazes
is going on?

07:58.545 --> 07:59.677
Discord..

08:02.949 --> 08:06.618
Oh, are you finally finished?
I've been done for a while.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.126
You know,
thinking back,

08:15.228 --> 08:17.161
I probably could have
been clearer WHICH pony

08:17.263 --> 08:19.197
to deliver the
messages to.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.331
Ya think?

08:23.637 --> 08:26.104
I sent them back to
Sweet Apple Acres.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.708
Apples are TERRIBLE
at taking directions.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.377
Couldn't even manage to
stay in one location.

08:32.479 --> 08:37.582
Now bananas... oh ho, are
MUCH better at listening.

08:37.684 --> 08:38.917
Sugar Belle:
What's going on?

08:39.419 --> 08:40.986
Apples running
EVERYWHERE

08:41.088 --> 08:44.089
and she didn't see the
poem to get to the hilltop!?

08:44.191 --> 08:46.157
Getting her to the
hilltop is easy,

08:46.259 --> 08:49.227
and not seeing the poems
is actually a blessing

08:49.329 --> 08:50.895
when you think about it.

08:56.470 --> 08:59.037
Why would you think
sending FLAMING messages

08:59.139 --> 09:02.841
into my desserts would work!?
You've ruined all of them!

09:02.943 --> 09:05.343
To be honest, I tasted
some and burning them

09:05.445 --> 09:06.711
might have been
an improvement.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.747
What? I NEVER!

09:08.850 --> 09:12.717
-Big Mac: Spike?
-Oh! Hey there, Big Mac. I
bet you're wondering what-

09:12.819 --> 09:13.585
Sugar Belle!

09:14.087 --> 09:14.953
Big Mac?

09:15.923 --> 09:17.322
DISCORD?

09:17.824 --> 09:19.090
Mrs. Cake!

09:19.192 --> 09:20.191
What did I do!?

09:21.161 --> 09:21.960
Nothing.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.430
I thought we were just
saying each other's names!

09:24.932 --> 09:27.232
Well, I guess this
can't get any worse.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.034
As the Lord of Chaos,

09:29.136 --> 09:31.102
I'd advise against
saying things like that.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.807
It's coming!
Save yourselves!

09:37.244 --> 09:39.911
[monster voice]
SUGAR BELLE!

09:42.241 --> 09:45.841
SUGAR BELLE!

09:50.224 --> 09:53.858
We have a bit of a reputation
for getting carried away.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.862
Especially when
romance is involved. Heh.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.663
But that WASN'T
the case with this.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.099
We were just helping
Sugar Belle with HER plan.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.572
And the last one should
just say, "Eyup."

10:08.977 --> 10:12.811
Oo. Er. So you're saying you want
to put each one of <i>those</i>

10:12.913 --> 10:14.446
inside a dessert?

10:14.748 --> 10:17.248
Well, since Big Mac's plan to
send me a Hearts and Hooves Day

10:17.350 --> 10:19.885
pie with a message
inside didn't go so well,

10:20.087 --> 10:22.020
I thought it'd be
fun to do it right.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.624
Aw! That's SO romantic!

10:26.126 --> 10:29.261
He's a pony of few words;
I love that about him!

10:29.363 --> 10:32.063
So I thought I'd use as
many words as possible

10:32.165 --> 10:35.334
to propose to him!
All he has to say is...

10:35.436 --> 10:40.338
EYUP! [giggle] I can't wait for you
to be a part of the family!

10:40.440 --> 10:42.040
You three played
such a big part

10:42.142 --> 10:43.775

getting together.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.320
And each word has to
go into a dessert!?

10:55.422 --> 10:58.689
That's... one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...Whoa!

10:58.791 --> 11:00.325
Twenty-one! I know!

11:01.027 --> 11:02.794
Actually, it's twenty-two.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.164
Mrs. Cake was kind
enough to help me bake

11:06.266 --> 11:08.099
ALL the apple-flavored
treats I made

11:08.201 --> 11:10.436
to get Big Mac to visit
me in my old shop,

11:11.138 --> 11:12.937
but THAT one has
the invitation

11:13.039 --> 11:15.373
for HIM to come HERE.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.910
Oh, it's no bother! I
DO love a challenge!

11:19.012 --> 11:21.880
Did I add the sugar to
this one or to that one?

11:24.618 --> 11:28.519
I think I've seen her add sugar
to that bowl six times so far..

11:29.690 --> 11:31.724
Now you three go
deliver that pie!

11:32.526 --> 11:35.061
I have to get some flowers
to spruce the place up!

11:35.963 --> 11:38.930
[gasp] Uh-oh! Spike and
Discord are outside.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.366
If they figure out
what we're up to,

11:40.468 --> 11:43.501
they'll spill the beans and I
want this to be a surprise!

11:49.776 --> 11:51.776
I don't think they
suspect anything!

11:51.978 --> 11:52.978
Why would they suspect

11:53.080 --> 11:54.713
that we're holding
an invitation pie

11:54.815 --> 11:57.516
and that Mrs. Cake is baking a
twenty-one-dessert proposal?

11:57.618 --> 12:00.285
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GONNA
HAVE A SISTER-IN-LAW!

This is our shot to make
up for all the trouble

12:08.361 --> 12:11.262
we caused when Big Mac first
asked Sugar Belle out!

12:11.364 --> 12:13.031
We can't give away
the surprise!

12:13.133 --> 12:14.599
You need to
play it cool!

12:14.801 --> 12:17.568
Right, right.
Uh, how's this?

12:18.672 --> 12:19.671
Better..?

12:19.873 --> 12:22.040
Come on! Let's go
find your brother!

12:24.477 --> 12:27.312

Let's go!

Hold on..

12:38.091 --> 12:39.724
That looks just
like the shelf

12:39.826 --> 12:43.361
Big Mac made for

Oh, hey there,

14:31.171 --> 14:34.472

14:34.674 --> 14:35.440
That's nice, Granny,

14:35.542 --> 14:37.175
but we REALLY need to
find Big Mac, so...

14:37.277 --> 14:40.178
It was about Grand
Pear, only it wasn't..

14:40.280 --> 14:43.214
And we were in outer space
on some kinda mission

14:43.316 --> 14:45.517

new worlds..

14:45.819 --> 14:47.952

14:48.054 --> 14:49.755
we'll never
find Big Mac!

all pointy-like.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.230
And then Discord showed up
and... well... you know,

14:59.332 --> 15:00.932
he was pretty
much the same...

15:01.034 --> 15:02.300

15:28.394 --> 15:30.628
Nothing. I thought
we were just saying

15:30.730 --> 15:31.897
each other's names!

15:32.399 --> 15:34.666

will you marry me?

16:11.772 --> 16:15.406

it was all my fault!

16:25.685 --> 16:27.718

16:29.689 --> 16:32.557
Wait. So you two were
orchestrating a proposal?

You should both be VERY
disappointed in yourselves.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.735
What about YOU and
your APPLE monster?

17:17.037 --> 17:19.704
Yes, but you all
EXPECT that of me..

17:20.106 --> 17:22.640
All we wanted to do was make
up for messing things up

17:22.742 --> 17:27.077
the last time! Sugar Belle,
Big Mac, we're really-

17:27.614 --> 17:28.546
Where'd they go?

17:29.816 --> 17:33.984
OK, this time it
REALLY wasn't me!

17:35.388 --> 17:38.089
I shouldn't have taken all
those desserts at once.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.458
It's just, how can you say
no to such a sweet idea?

17:40.560 --> 17:44.429
Oh! Ha! Sweet! Haha! I made a joke!

17:44.731 --> 17:47.799
In retrospect, dragon
flame and baked goods

17:47.901 --> 17:49.300
aren't the best combo.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.870
We felt like it
was all our fault.

17:51.972 --> 17:53.471
Except for the
apple monster.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.139
THAT was Discord.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.342
And Mrs. Cake messing
up those recipes..

17:57.444 --> 17:59.710
And Spike burning the
messed up recipes. And--

17:59.812 --> 18:02.246
The point is we
ALL felt bad

18:02.348 --> 18:05.316
for ruining Big Mac and
Sugar Belle's proposals!

18:05.718 --> 18:09.821
It was all green and THEN
Grand Pear looked at me

18:09.923 --> 18:15.460
all dramatical and says "where
NOPONY has gone before"!

18:15.562 --> 18:17.361
And WHOOSH! Away we flew!

18:20.600 --> 18:22.900
Today was...
interesting.

18:23.002 --> 18:23.668
Eyup.

18:24.737 --> 18:25.870
You OK?

18:25.972 --> 18:26.771
I...

18:29.776 --> 18:31.209
I'm sorry, Sugar Belle.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.812
I wanted everything
to go right today.

18:34.114 --> 18:37.382
I wanted our love to be as
perfect as my parents' was

18:37.484 --> 18:39.751
when they planted these
two trees together.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.387
Instead, it turned
into a mess.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.155
Just like when I
asked you out,

18:44.257 --> 18:46.557
just like Hearts
and Hooves Day...

18:46.759 --> 18:48.393
No matter how
hard I try,

18:48.495 --> 18:51.329
I always seem to mess
up when it comes to you.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.899
I think you've got
things backwards.

18:55.001 --> 18:55.867
What do you mean?

18:56.369 --> 18:58.603
From everything you told
me about your parents,

18:58.705 --> 19:00.438
they had to deal with
things a lot tougher

19:00.540 --> 19:03.875
than some burnt desserts
and an apple monster.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.277
I... guess that's true.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.948
This apple tree and pear
tree are stronger together.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.983
They'll survive
whatever comes

19:12.085 --> 19:14.619
because they don't
have to do it <i>alone</i>.

19:14.721 --> 19:18.990
They BELONG together. Like
your parents. And like us.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.025
Eyup.

19:20.827 --> 19:24.395
Today was a disaster. But
today was also the last day

19:24.497 --> 19:26.998
we're ever going to have
to do anything apart.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.801
From here on out,
we'll be together.

19:30.103 --> 19:33.673
And we'll make sure everything
always works out just right.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.341
Big Mac will you...
Sugar Belle will you...

19:36.643 --> 19:37.742
No, I'm sorry.
Sorry.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.444
Sure. One.

Two.

19:41.447 --> 19:43.114
Both: Will you marry me?

19:43.216 --> 19:44.215
Both: Eyup!

19:50.923 --> 19:52.924
We'll have to thank our
friends for messing up so bad

19:53.026 --> 19:55.860
that they made it all
work out perfectly.

19:58.999 --> 20:02.133
Well, we've ALL made up and
we're here for a do-over.

20:02.235 --> 20:05.103
And this time, thanks to
me, we've got it right!

20:05.205 --> 20:07.838
So, why don't you
two... you know.

20:10.276 --> 20:13.143
Uh. I think they
did OK without us.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.481
And THAT'S how we
were responsible

20:16.583 --> 20:18.449

Heh. Or should I say PAIR-posal!

up so bad...
