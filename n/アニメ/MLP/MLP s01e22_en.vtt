00:05.630 --> 00:07.684
There you go, Mr. Mousey.

00:11.008 --> 00:13.717
Now you stay off that leg
and do everything I told you.

00:13.718 --> 00:16.556
And it will be just like new in no time at all.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.612
Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help.

00:27.035 --> 00:29.259
You... found a watch?

00:30.682 --> 00:33.322
You... wanna be a watch?

00:36.024 --> 00:37.130
You're running!

00:38.110 --> 00:39.337
Running out of time?

00:39.480 --> 00:41.313
No. You're... late?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.977
I'm late for a very important date!

00:53.978 --> 00:56.871
The big brunch for Princess Celestia
at Sugarcube Corner.

01:00.149 --> 01:02.607
Oh, the Princess is here
in Ponyville for a party...

01:02.608 --> 01:05.536
...and we all promised we'd be there.
But I'm not there!

01:05.537 --> 01:06.866
Oh, do I look all right?

01:06.867 --> 01:07.910
Do I need to bring anything?

01:07.911 --> 01:08.937
Maybe I shouldn't go?

01:11.321 --> 01:13.370
It's starting! I'm missing it!

01:15.497 --> 01:17.084
Oh, thanks, Angel.

01:20.039 --> 01:22.759
I mean, if you hadn't reminded me,
I might have not remembered and then...

01:22.760 --> 01:25.569
...then I wouldn't be there and everypony
would be wondering where I was and...

01:25.684 --> 01:27.311
Oh, right. I'm late.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.303
Oh, okay then. See you later.

02:22.579 --> 02:27.104
So... what do I have to do to get to be
one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway?

02:29.005 --> 02:30.032
Is the pay good?

02:31.582 --> 02:34.645
Hellooo! Anybody home?

02:46.737 --> 02:48.852
Ooh, you're good.

02:50.356 --> 02:51.718
Too good. I'm bored.

02:54.972 --> 02:55.815
Made it.

02:57.308 --> 02:59.278
-Halt!
-Who goes there?

02:59.960 --> 03:02.216
No one. Never mind. I'll go home.

03:04.063 --> 03:07.083
It's all right, sirs. She's on the list.

03:08.301 --> 03:09.515
Thanks, Twilight.

03:09.516 --> 03:11.874
I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.739
It wouldn't be the same without you.

03:21.663 --> 03:24.480
How's everypony doing? Good? Good.

03:25.287 --> 03:27.237
Anything else we can get for you, dearies...?

03:27.238 --> 03:30.391
Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests.

03:31.381 --> 03:33.789
Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

03:34.431 --> 03:37.866
Sorry I'm late. I had to finish
taking care of a patient first.

03:37.867 --> 03:40.877
Oh, you and your Tender Loving Care of little animals.

03:40.977 --> 03:43.780
I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you.

03:43.781 --> 03:46.813
I mean, I hope she will...
I mean, of course she will!

03:47.213 --> 03:51.306
Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one
who got nervous at social gatherings.

03:51.307 --> 03:55.171
Oh, it's not that. I just want the Princess
to approve of my friends.

03:55.249 --> 03:57.115
But she's met us all before.

03:57.116 --> 03:58.653
And read about you in my letters.

03:58.853 --> 04:01.130
But this is the first time she spent any real time with you.

04:01.131 --> 04:03.064
I want everypony to make a good impression.

04:03.164 --> 04:05.953
Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.611
Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?

04:08.612 --> 04:09.838
Don't touch me!

04:10.067 --> 04:13.509
Watch the dress!
Careful, you're gonna spill that on me!

04:14.492 --> 04:17.462
Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it?

04:17.463 --> 04:20.059
Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!

04:20.264 --> 04:22.628
Or... perhaps not that casual.

04:24.905 --> 04:28.425
Uh... which is the salad
and which is the appetizer again?

04:28.742 --> 04:30.468
And which am I supposed to eat first?

04:37.641 --> 04:39.438
Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry.

04:40.568 --> 04:43.733
It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect.

04:43.734 --> 04:45.802
I doubt the Princess will even notice.

04:47.547 --> 04:49.440
Cookies, candies and pies! Oh my!

04:51.413 --> 04:54.467
Chocolate Fountainy goodness!

05:01.127 --> 05:02.037
You gonna eat that?!

05:07.676 --> 05:08.634
Hey!

05:10.353 --> 05:12.376
A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.

05:12.476 --> 05:14.472
That's quite all right, thank you.

05:19.785 --> 05:21.243
Empty teacup at 4 o'clock!

05:21.244 --> 05:22.751
Uh, I see it, honey bun!

05:23.118 --> 05:24.873
Oh, um... thank you.

05:24.984 --> 05:27.084
Not at all, Your Highness.

05:28.249 --> 05:29.609
Thank you again.

05:29.610 --> 05:31.404
Oh, but of course, Your Majesty.

05:37.800 --> 05:38.748
Gotcha!

05:41.511 --> 05:43.697
And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?

05:43.894 --> 05:46.221
Me? Oh yes, Your Highness.

05:46.421 --> 05:48.220
I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters...

05:48.221 --> 05:51.029
...that you enjoy tending
to the needs of woodland creatures.

05:51.460 --> 05:54.369
Yes, I love to take care of animals.

05:54.370 --> 05:59.132
As do I. As princess, I care deeply
about all creatures, great and small.

06:01.503 --> 06:05.081
Nothing means more to me
than the well-being of all my subjects.

06:08.214 --> 06:10.910
Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake.

06:11.110 --> 06:13.221
Do say hello to our gracious hosts.

06:18.527 --> 06:20.309
Oh... my.

06:20.678 --> 06:22.783
She is quite a sight, isn't she?

06:23.017 --> 06:27.667
I... I... I've never seen anything like it.

06:33.341 --> 06:36.072
Really? Well, if I must...

06:36.433 --> 06:39.880
I'm sorry, everypony.
I'm afraid I have to cut the party short.

06:41.337 --> 06:43.314
The mayor has requested an audience with me.

06:43.315 --> 06:47.196
Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time.

06:47.296 --> 06:49.599
It's been a joy getting to know you all better.

07:01.388 --> 07:04.541
Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved!

07:12.107 --> 07:15.642
Stay right where you are.
All I want is a clear path to the exit.

07:15.950 --> 07:18.494
NOBODY MOVE and my dress won't get hurt!

07:18.594 --> 07:20.343
Stay back! Back, I say!

07:26.011 --> 07:26.985
Well, Spike...

07:27.431 --> 07:29.985
I don't know for sure
how things went with the Princess...

07:29.986 --> 07:33.272
...but at least no big disasters happened.

07:39.888 --> 07:41.683
Oh, you poor little thing.

07:41.684 --> 07:43.946
How did you ever get in such bad condition?

07:44.601 --> 07:47.963
Don't you worry, Philomena.
I'll nurse you back to health.

07:47.964 --> 07:52.896
As a favor to the Princess, who's obviously
just far too busy to care for you properly.

07:56.660 --> 07:59.456
I'm sure the Princess will appreciate the help.

08:04.563 --> 08:07.610
Oh my. We'd better get you to bed right away.

08:09.869 --> 08:10.604
There.

08:42.373 --> 08:46.118
This is far worse than I thought.
What you need is some medicine. Stat!

08:49.700 --> 08:53.056
Here you go, Philomena.
This will fix you right up.

08:55.842 --> 08:57.942
Doctor Fluttershy expected that.

09:05.593 --> 09:06.941
Always works.

09:10.105 --> 09:12.083
Uh... Almost always.

09:18.101 --> 09:21.605
There's nothing like home-made soup
to cure what ails you.

09:24.131 --> 09:27.431
Come on now. You're not gonna get better
if you don't cooperate.

09:28.143 --> 09:30.953
Mmm... See? It's delicious.

09:30.954 --> 09:32.680
Good and good for you.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.698
Here come the choo-choo train.

09:36.824 --> 09:38.864
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!

09:48.235 --> 09:49.958
Oh dear.

09:49.959 --> 09:52.497
Don't worry, Philomena.
I know what'll make you feel better.

09:52.498 --> 09:54.853
Wait right here. I have just the thing.

09:58.128 --> 10:02.420
Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow
feathered friend by to cheer you up.

10:02.421 --> 10:07.144
Hummingway here was sick once too,
but he let me help him and got better in no time.

10:07.145 --> 10:08.547
Didn't you, boy?

10:10.299 --> 10:13.113
Say hello to your new friend Philomena.

10:16.029 --> 10:18.884
Aw, look. I think he likes you.

10:25.283 --> 10:27.042
Your turn now, Philomena.

10:28.043 --> 10:30.010
Go ahead. You can do it.

10:36.531 --> 10:38.496
Um... good try?

10:39.906 --> 10:42.119
I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.684
A humidifier.

10:49.494 --> 10:50.733
Refreshing.

10:50.911 --> 10:53.744
How's that feeling now for you,
Philomena? Better?

11:02.485 --> 11:03.690
Oh...

11:06.236 --> 11:07.154
That's okay.

11:07.155 --> 11:09.524
I know lots of other ways to take care of you.

11:09.525 --> 11:11.591
Don't worry. You're gonna get better.

11:11.592 --> 11:12.726
How about...

11:15.213 --> 11:16.485
Aromatherapy?

11:25.571 --> 11:26.691
Warm bath?

11:33.458 --> 11:34.517
Ointment?

11:40.738 --> 11:41.385
Scalpel.

11:43.119 --> 11:43.961
Surgical tape.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.339
Feathers.

11:55.483 --> 11:57.046
Oh, Philomena.

11:57.047 --> 11:59.377
I thought it would be easy
to nurse you back to health.

11:59.378 --> 12:01.732
I've tried everything I know.

12:01.733 --> 12:04.849
And look at you. You're worse than ever.

12:09.021 --> 12:09.902
Hi, Fluttershy!

12:09.903 --> 12:12.710
I just wanted to drop by and
say thank you so very much...

12:12.711 --> 12:15.154
...for making such a good impression
on the Princess today...

12:17.186 --> 12:19.587
What is Celestia's pet doing here?!

12:19.588 --> 12:23.190
I couldn't leave the poor thing there.
She needed my help.

12:23.191 --> 12:24.808
Oh no. NonononononoNO!

12:24.809 --> 12:26.216
This is bad.

12:26.616 --> 12:29.138
How could I just walk away and not do anything?

12:29.139 --> 12:31.296
But... but... she doesn't belong to you!

12:31.297 --> 12:32.858
I had to do something.

12:32.859 --> 12:36.024
Without telling anypony?!
Without asking permission?!

12:36.025 --> 12:36.720
But...

12:37.473 --> 12:39.698
I know you had good intentions...

12:39.699 --> 12:42.053
...but you have got to return Princess's pet!

12:42.054 --> 12:43.174
But...

12:49.709 --> 12:51.112
You're right.

12:51.322 --> 12:52.637
Okay, let's...

12:53.991 --> 12:54.820
...go.

12:58.331 --> 13:01.979
If we hurry, we can put her back
before anypony even realizes she's missing.

13:09.916 --> 13:12.038
We were told we could find Twilight Sparkle here.

13:12.039 --> 13:13.408
We regret to inform you, miss...

13:13.608 --> 13:15.281
...that the royal pet has gone missing.

13:15.282 --> 13:18.486
Really? You don't say!

13:36.573 --> 13:38.712
It's that dry night air.

13:38.713 --> 13:40.165
But it's daytime.

13:40.461 --> 13:43.266
Well, day air's even drier.

13:43.964 --> 13:48.250
You guards better be on your way
if you're gonna find the Princess's missing pet.

13:48.650 --> 13:49.613
Philomena, was it?

13:49.614 --> 13:51.744
Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop.

13:51.759 --> 13:52.859
BYE!

13:59.147 --> 13:59.973
What are you doing?!

14:00.196 --> 14:02.194
Going to return Philomena, remember?

14:02.195 --> 14:03.667
We can't now!

14:03.668 --> 14:04.533
Why not?

14:04.633 --> 14:09.762
You have no idea what the Princess is gonna do
if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!

14:09.842 --> 14:10.958
Do you?

14:10.962 --> 14:13.318
Well... no.

14:13.518 --> 14:15.690
But it can't be anything good.

14:15.691 --> 14:18.404
She might banish you from Equestria.

14:18.405 --> 14:20.172
Or throw you in a dungeon.

14:21.836 --> 14:25.869
Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon
in the place that she banishes you to.

14:26.247 --> 14:29.143
You really think the Princess would do that?

14:29.658 --> 14:32.354
Okay. Granted that probably won't happen...

14:32.558 --> 14:34.443
...but do you wanna take any chances?

14:34.565 --> 14:38.546
All that really matters to me is that
poor little Philomena here gets well.

14:40.452 --> 14:42.147
That's very noble of you.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.887
I'll write to you when you're banished.

14:43.888 --> 14:46.862
Unless I'm banished too
somewhere there's no post office.

14:46.945 --> 14:48.855
Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?

14:49.191 --> 14:52.419
Please, Twilight. You just have to
help me get Philomena healthy...

14:52.420 --> 14:54.303
...and then we can return her to the Princess.

14:54.615 --> 14:56.508
And everything will be fine.

14:57.226 --> 14:59.449
Did you give her any kind of medicine?

14:59.450 --> 15:01.631
I tried to, but she wouldn't take it.

15:02.648 --> 15:04.609
Then you have to MAKE her take it.

15:04.610 --> 15:06.941
You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy!

15:06.942 --> 15:09.106
You need to show this patient who's the boss.

15:09.107 --> 15:11.360
Make her straighten up and fly right!

15:11.578 --> 15:13.085
She can't fly.

15:13.458 --> 15:14.812
No excuses!

15:18.099 --> 15:20.033
Done. Okay, what else?

15:20.100 --> 15:23.037
Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off.

15:23.038 --> 15:25.997
The ones that haven't fallen out yet
from all her coughing, I mean.

15:27.850 --> 15:28.786
There you go.

15:32.007 --> 15:33.665
I don't think she likes it.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.853
Tough love, baby.

15:34.854 --> 15:36.714
You want her to get well, don't you?

15:36.914 --> 15:38.734
-Of course, but...
-NEXT!

15:38.818 --> 15:41.412
Well, she desperately needs some bed rest...

15:41.413 --> 15:43.496
...but I can't get her to stay put.

15:46.537 --> 15:47.813
One step ahead of you.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.410
It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise.

15:52.511 --> 15:55.514
Please, just relax and try to get some sleep.

15:55.552 --> 15:58.483
What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.

15:58.828 --> 16:02.099
I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.155
Oh, she'll eat it, all right.

16:09.266 --> 16:10.846
Hey! Where are you going?

16:11.096 --> 16:13.077
No! Philomena! Come back!

17:11.329 --> 17:13.414
What are you two doing?
Are you having a race?

17:13.415 --> 17:15.155
Oh, can I play? 123GO!

17:23.211 --> 17:24.973
-Excuse me!
-Hi!

17:25.676 --> 17:26.576
Beg your pardon!

17:26.677 --> 17:27.714
Put me down!

17:28.470 --> 17:29.664
What in tarnation?!

17:29.665 --> 17:32.339
-Sorry, but we've gotta find...
-The Princess's pet bird!

17:34.243 --> 17:36.234
Philomena! Come down from there!

17:36.235 --> 17:37.502
You'll hurt yourself!

17:49.794 --> 17:50.752
I'll catch you!

18:07.174 --> 18:09.067
What is going on here?

18:11.618 --> 18:12.478
Twilight.

18:12.902 --> 18:14.965
Yes, Your Majesty?

18:15.614 --> 18:17.529
There's been a terrible accident.

18:18.428 --> 18:20.224
It's all my fault.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.003
No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better.

18:23.004 --> 18:24.439
It was my fault.

18:24.550 --> 18:27.315
-I'm the one who did it.
-But you were only trying to help.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.790
Some help I was.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.893
Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.

18:32.088 --> 18:33.590
But it's my fault!

18:33.591 --> 18:34.890
No, it's my fault!

18:34.891 --> 18:36.307
No! It's my fault!

18:36.712 --> 18:38.424
Wait. What are we talking about?

18:39.616 --> 18:41.581
Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but...

18:41.582 --> 18:44.542
Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird.

18:44.642 --> 18:47.158
I really was only trying to help the poor little thing.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.813
Then I was gonna bring it back to you, honest.

18:52.359 --> 18:56.469
So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me
in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to...

18:56.991 --> 18:58.406
...then that's what I deserve.

19:04.223 --> 19:06.961
Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena.

19:06.962 --> 19:08.667
You're scaring everypony.

19:20.546 --> 19:22.001
I don't understand!

19:23.663 --> 19:26.504
What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?

19:26.879 --> 19:28.305
This is Philomena.

19:28.389 --> 19:30.197
She's quite a sight, as I said.

19:30.198 --> 19:32.514
But nothing unusual for a phoenix.

19:32.515 --> 19:33.873
Isn't that right, Philomena?

19:36.153 --> 19:38.069
A... A phoenix?

19:38.070 --> 19:41.102
A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird.

19:41.103 --> 19:43.681
While it appears healthy and happy
most of the time...

19:44.590 --> 19:49.310
...every so often it must renew itself by shedding
all of its feathers and bursting into flame.

19:50.672 --> 19:52.782
Rather melodramatic, if you ask me.

19:53.534 --> 19:56.481
It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy.

19:56.727 --> 19:59.131
All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix.

19:59.541 --> 20:01.813
I'm afraid, mischievous little Philomena here...

20:01.814 --> 20:04.353
...took the occasion to have
a little fun with you, Fluttershy.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.344
Say you're sorry, young lady.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.736
So... aren't you gonna banish me?
Or throw me in a dungeon?

20:10.737 --> 20:13.754
Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon
in the place that you banish me to?

20:14.029 --> 20:16.138
Of course not, my little pony.

20:16.533 --> 20:18.878
Where on Earth would you get such an idea?

20:19.382 --> 20:21.936
I guess I have some imagination.

20:21.937 --> 20:25.968
Fluttershy really did do everything she could
to try to take care of Philomena for you.

20:25.994 --> 20:29.194
And I do appreciate that your heart
was in the right place, child.

20:29.195 --> 20:32.469
But all you had to do was ask me and
I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix...

20:32.470 --> 20:34.132
...and saved you all this trouble.

20:34.333 --> 20:37.233
I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.

20:37.434 --> 20:40.544
Next time I'll ask before
taking matters into my own hooves.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.643
Should I write you a letter
about that lesson, Princess?

20:44.362 --> 20:47.908
No, that's quite all right.
I think I can remember.

20:55.857 --> 20:57.523
It's beautiful.

20:57.836 --> 20:59.237
Thank you, Philomena.

20:59.238 --> 21:01.115
No hard feelings.

21:19.893 --> 21:20.805
Yes!

21:29.709 --> 21:33.209
