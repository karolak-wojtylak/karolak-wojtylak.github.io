WEBVTT

00:05.750 --> 00:08.060
Well, that's the last
of it, Filthy Rich.

00:08.270 --> 00:13.485
Just Rich, please. And on behalf
of Rich's Barnyard Bargains,

00:13.510 --> 00:17.090
thanks for another season's
shipment of Zap Apple Jam.

00:17.425 --> 00:19.265
Our pleasure. See
ya next time!

00:22.820 --> 00:26.445
Uh, Apple Bloom? Did you pack up
the cider into the same crates

00:26.470 --> 00:27.915
as the Zap Apple Jam?

00:28.160 --> 00:30.420
Sure did! Now that
I'm getting older,

00:30.505 --> 00:33.885
I want to prove I can handle
more responsibility on the farm.

00:34.050 --> 00:35.815
But the crates aren't marked.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.650
You kept track of what when
into which crate, right?

00:39.055 --> 00:43.755
Oh. Um... Yep. I totally
kept track of everything.

00:44.755 --> 00:47.745
Good. Because we wouldn't want
Filthy Rich to get a shipment

00:47.765 --> 00:50.675
of cider when he's supposed
to get Zap Apple Jam.

00:50.790 --> 00:53.225
You know how Granny
feels about selling cider

00:53.255 --> 00:54.610
anywhere but
on the farm.

00:55.015 --> 00:57.195
Are you sure he
got the right crates?

00:58.190 --> 00:59.440
Sure, I'm sure!

01:00.360 --> 01:02.820
Now why don't you and Big
Mac head on out to the house

01:02.865 --> 01:04.290
and let me finish up here!

01:06.660 --> 01:10.810
If you gave Rich the Zap Apple
Jam, then what's this here?

01:11.140 --> 01:13.330
Um... Extra?

01:13.805 --> 01:15.145
Nnope!

#APPLEJACK2016 - MAKE CIDER ALCOHOLIC AGAIN!
https://yp1.yayponies.eu

01:57.150 --> 02:00.740
Granny knows I wasn't trying
to make off with a shipment

02:00.760 --> 02:04.370
of cider, right? Because
I would never do that.

02:04.580 --> 02:08.105
Don't worry. We know
exactly whose fault it was.

02:13.625 --> 02:16.560
Now, why in tarnation would
you lie to me, Apple Bloom?

02:16.920 --> 02:20.335
I was kinda hoping I could fix
it before anypony found out.

02:20.545 --> 02:24.450
Telling lies won't fix
anything. Trust me, I know.

02:24.490 --> 02:26.245
What could you
possibly know about it?

02:26.370 --> 02:28.730
You've never told a
lie in your whole life.

02:35.765 --> 02:36.585
What's so funny?

02:36.720 --> 02:41.105
Oh, sugar cube, your
big sister lied so much

02:41.155 --> 02:44.895
when she was a filly, the whole
family ended up in the hospital.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.010
WHAT?!

02:46.420 --> 02:47.315
Eeyup.

02:47.615 --> 02:50.945
You might as well
tell her the whole story.

02:51.055 --> 02:52.350
It might even do
her some good.

02:53.130 --> 02:56.650
When Applejack and Big Mac
were just a wee bit older

02:56.690 --> 03:00.315
than you are now, they
both kept squabblin' over

03:00.340 --> 03:02.425
who would run
the farm better.

03:04.015 --> 03:07.660
All I'm sayin' is that you
may have plenty of brawn,

03:07.705 --> 03:10.120
but I'm the one with the
ideas on how to run things

03:10.160 --> 03:11.220
better around here.

03:11.355 --> 03:13.940
Applejack, Applejack,
Applejack.

03:13.975 --> 03:15.775
Ideas are all
well and good,

03:15.810 --> 03:17.985
but you can't plow
a field with them.

03:18.105 --> 03:20.975
I don't know how many
times I've told you that.

03:21.020 --> 03:21.915
Too many!

03:22.050 --> 03:25.870
You two horned toads better stop
jabberin' and get to workin'!

03:26.065 --> 03:28.885
Yeah they'd better! I
need you to go to town.

03:28.935 --> 03:32.330
The apple blight's been awful
and if we don't get more spray,

03:32.380 --> 03:35.310
cider season'll be shorter
than a dwarf crab-apple tree.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.725
Like I was just telling
cousin Braeburn last week;

03:38.755 --> 03:41.695
now there's a pony who knows how
to put his back into a problem.

03:43.945 --> 03:45.920
Oh hi there, Filthy Rich!

03:46.255 --> 03:47.705
Just Rich, please.

03:47.750 --> 03:51.635
And I'd like you to meet
my fiancée, Spoiled Milk.

03:51.685 --> 03:54.175
Honey, this is
Applejack and Big Mac,

03:54.315 --> 03:57.225
the two hardest-working
ponies at Sweet Apple Acres.

03:58.480 --> 04:02.835
You work on a farm?
How... quaint.

04:02.940 --> 04:05.195
Oh ho now,
dear, be nice.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.615
Sweet Apple Acres
makes Zap Apple Jam.

04:07.635 --> 04:09.885
It's one of Dad's
best-sellers.

04:10.575 --> 04:13.225
You mean one of
your best-sellers.

04:13.305 --> 04:15.440
My amazing husband-to-be
is running the

04:15.475 --> 04:19.895
Rich family business now. Did
you know that? Well, now you do.

04:20.710 --> 04:23.920
Don't mind Spoiled Milk.
She's just proud of me.

04:24.065 --> 04:27.065
But she's right; I'm in
charge of the store now

04:27.090 --> 04:30.105
and I'm just bursting
with ideas I wanna try.

04:30.325 --> 04:31.290
Like what?

04:31.600 --> 04:35.570
Well, how about this? Cider
season's around the corner.

04:35.770 --> 04:37.930
Why not let me
sell it for you?

04:38.545 --> 04:40.655
That is an
interesting idea.

04:40.730 --> 04:43.555
Well, maybe it's interesting
and maybe it ain't,

04:43.670 --> 04:45.775
but it's definitely
not a new idea.

04:45.855 --> 04:48.345
Granny Smith told us your
grandpa, Stinkin' Rich,

04:48.395 --> 04:50.670
used to ask her every year
if he could sell our cider

04:50.715 --> 04:53.350
in your store, and Granny
told him every year

04:53.380 --> 04:55.625
about the tradition of
everypony in Ponyville

04:55.660 --> 04:57.590
lining up out at
Sweet Apple Acres.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.920
So, start a new tradition!

04:59.950 --> 05:02.350
Someday one of you'll
take over the farm

05:02.380 --> 05:04.775
just like I've taken
over the store.

05:05.060 --> 05:08.900
I'm guessing it'll be the
one with the best ideas.

05:09.115 --> 05:12.260
Well, now, as I've said
many a time before,

05:12.470 --> 05:15.495
ideas are all well and good,
but you can't plow a field--

05:15.510 --> 05:18.335
You know what? How about
we give you three barrels

05:18.390 --> 05:20.720
of cider early, and
if it sells well,

05:20.805 --> 05:22.185
we'll make a deal
for the rest.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.680
Oh, hey now! Perfect!

05:24.830 --> 05:27.935
Come on, honey. I've got
to get everything ready.

05:28.200 --> 05:32.305
Hoo-wee, I tell ya, if the
future means me running

05:32.350 --> 05:36.710
Sweet Apple Acres and you
being quiet, I can't wait!

05:39.580 --> 05:42.695
I just can't believe you'd
make a deal with Filthy Rich

05:42.750 --> 05:44.405
without even talking to Granny.

05:44.550 --> 05:47.480
Aw, Granny will love the
idea and then she'll decide

05:47.515 --> 05:50.645
that I'm the one who should
take over the farm. You'll see.

05:50.795 --> 05:52.115
See what?

05:52.975 --> 05:56.525
Applejack here had another
one of her "big ideas,"

05:56.670 --> 05:59.295
and I think we all know my
position on ideas, you...

05:59.330 --> 06:01.875
...can't plow a
field with them.

06:02.010 --> 06:03.500
Eey... Right.

06:04.165 --> 06:06.550
Big idea, huh?

06:07.950 --> 06:09.775
Actually, more of
an opportunity.

06:10.105 --> 06:12.420
You see, we ran into
Filthy Rich in town.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.365
Did you know he's running
the family store now?

06:14.485 --> 06:16.965
And what does this
here "opportunity"

06:17.025 --> 06:19.215
mean for Sweet
Apple Acres?

06:19.470 --> 06:24.195
Well, since cider season is
almost here, he or, I mean,

06:24.265 --> 06:27.955
I thought it'd be a good idea to
give him a few barrels of cider

06:27.990 --> 06:30.220
to sell at the store
before the season starts.

06:30.435 --> 06:32.315
Oh, is that all?

06:33.875 --> 06:36.075
Absolutely not!

06:36.740 --> 06:37.965
Hmmm.

06:40.925 --> 06:44.940
But Granny, why can't we sell
a few barrels of cider early

06:44.985 --> 06:48.135
to Filthy Rich? How's it any
different than when you gave

06:48.200 --> 06:50.820
Zap Apple Jam to Filthy's
grandpappy to sell?

06:50.970 --> 06:54.560
Your cider and your jam
ain't the same thing!

06:54.660 --> 06:57.520
Zap Apple Jam jars preserve
the flavor for moons,

06:57.600 --> 06:59.560
but cider starts to spoil

06:59.580 --> 07:01.510
the second it comes
out of the press.

07:01.710 --> 07:05.395
That is why every cider season,
all of Ponyville lines up

07:05.420 --> 07:08.865
at Sweet Apple Acres and first
come is first served. Hmm!

07:09.225 --> 07:11.200
I get what you're
saying, Granny,

07:11.320 --> 07:14.345
but couldn't you make an
exception just this once?

07:14.665 --> 07:16.410
I sorta promised.

07:17.280 --> 07:22.145
Meh-eh. Besides, cider-makin'
is iffy business.

07:22.260 --> 07:24.730
And we're probably not gonna
have a lot this year anyway,

07:24.785 --> 07:25.915
what with all the blight.

07:26.150 --> 07:30.700
I'm sorry, Applejack, but
you'll have to un-promise.

07:30.975 --> 07:32.380
Oh!

07:34.390 --> 07:37.270
I hate to say I told
you so, Applejack, but--

07:37.305 --> 07:40.655
You and I both know you
don't hate to say anything.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.685
Well, I've always thought
that the most important thing

07:43.705 --> 07:46.070
a pony can do is say
exactly what's on his mind

07:46.100 --> 07:48.575
to anypony who'll listen
so everypony everywhere

07:48.625 --> 07:50.930
always knows everything
you're thinking and...

07:50.970 --> 07:53.765
And you don't ever have to
listen to anypony else.

07:54.075 --> 07:54.700
What?

07:55.740 --> 07:56.620
Exactly.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.715
Well, if it ain't my
new business partner!

08:03.025 --> 08:05.365
Um, about the
cider, Rich...

08:05.700 --> 08:09.110
Take a look at what I did last
night after we made our deal.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.950
Woo! Pretty great, huh?

08:13.325 --> 08:16.455
The thing is, I don't
think I can get you any.

08:17.360 --> 08:21.220
What?! But I did all
this work on your say-so.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.140
We shook hooves and
everything.

08:23.350 --> 08:25.325
Well, you see, at
Sweet Apple Acres,

08:25.360 --> 08:28.690
we've always been about quality
and while your basic jam jar'll-

08:28.745 --> 08:30.705
Plus it's been a tough
harvest this year,

08:30.910 --> 08:32.155
what with all the
blight.

08:33.065 --> 08:36.115
Sounds to me like you're
trying to make excuses.

08:36.330 --> 08:40.615
Whenever Granddad dealt with
Granny Smith, she kept her word.

08:40.725 --> 08:43.385
If you can't do that,
then maybe our families

08:43.455 --> 08:46.830
should stop doing business
together. Altogether!

08:48.370 --> 08:52.490
Now, now, the thing is, Rich,
it ain't really up to us.

08:52.645 --> 08:54.025
You see, Granny's--

08:54.090 --> 08:54.795
--sick!

08:54.970 --> 08:58.450
Wait. Granny's
sick? I had no idea!

08:58.655 --> 09:01.075
Eey... Yeah, nopony did.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.725
What Big Mac means is we've
been trying to keep it quiet.

09:05.910 --> 09:07.665
We don't want people
to make rash decisions

09:07.685 --> 09:09.560
about doing business
with Sweet Apple Acres

09:09.620 --> 09:12.480
just because we're a little
short-hooved at the moment.

09:12.645 --> 09:17.280
Oh my! Of course, of
course. I am so sorry.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.835
Please let me know if
there's anything I can do.

09:21.105 --> 09:24.625
Much appreciated. But
right now, we only ask

09:24.690 --> 09:27.695
for your understanding
during this difficult time.

09:28.090 --> 09:29.225
Mm hm.

09:30.390 --> 09:32.525
Big Mac: You were supposed to
tell Rich the simple truth,

09:32.615 --> 09:36.155
but instead you made things
worse with a giant lie!

09:36.420 --> 09:39.590
Well, what was I supposed
to do? You heard Rich.

09:39.710 --> 09:42.335
If I told him the truth, he
was gonna stop doing business

09:42.365 --> 09:43.475
with us altogether.

09:43.715 --> 09:45.230
Yeah, but that's
only because--

09:45.310 --> 09:48.720
--I forgot to ask if we
had any oat crumbles

09:48.770 --> 09:51.090
for this delicious-looking
salad, Granny!

09:52.155 --> 09:53.615
I'll go take a look.

09:55.555 --> 09:57.980
--that was only because you made
promises you couldn't keep,

09:58.140 --> 09:59.915
but there's gotta be a
better way out of this mess

09:59.985 --> 10:02.815
than by making up some story
about Granny being sick!

10:03.025 --> 10:04.215
Well, it worked, didn't it?

10:06.150 --> 10:08.750
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

10:08.865 --> 10:12.585
We just wanted to come by to
wish Granny a speedy recovery.

10:12.820 --> 10:17.425
Look, sis, our good friend Mr.
Rich and his fiancée are here.

10:17.870 --> 10:21.075
Oh, and they brought
flowers. For Granny.

10:21.530 --> 10:26.115
On account of she's sick, like
you said. Ain't that sweet?

10:28.025 --> 10:29.570
Uh, excuse me one second!

10:33.070 --> 10:34.915
What in tarnation?!

10:35.155 --> 10:37.730
Oh, I'm sorry, Granny.
I didn't see you there.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.630
You came blasting in so fast,

10:39.680 --> 10:41.640
t'weren't possible
to see nothin'!

10:42.435 --> 10:43.665
Can you go out to the barn?

10:43.755 --> 10:46.280
I, uh, I think we might
have left a blight sprayer

10:46.335 --> 10:47.135
in the orchard.

10:47.320 --> 10:51.720
Are you outta your apple-pickin'
mind? It's suppertime, girl!

10:51.855 --> 10:54.205
I know, but if we
forgot a sprayer,

10:54.250 --> 10:56.925
I'd wanna get it before
dark. You go start counting

10:57.020 --> 10:59.740
and I'll tell Big Mac
we'll be right back, OK?

11:01.670 --> 11:04.550
So from that moment on, I
took to referring to myself

11:04.585 --> 11:06.925
as Big or Large or--

11:07.720 --> 11:10.555
Oh Applejack, your brother
was just explaining

11:10.610 --> 11:12.895
why he always wears his yoke.

11:13.120 --> 11:16.665
Even though we asked him how
your grandmare is doing.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.905
Oh, you know how Big
Mac can get to talking,

11:20.070 --> 11:22.365
especially when he's
upset. And right now,

11:22.445 --> 11:25.280
he's just as worried about
Granny Smith as I am.

11:27.155 --> 11:29.795
Oh dear. Is she doing that bad?

11:30.390 --> 11:32.225
Well, one thing's for sure,

11:32.310 --> 11:34.530
she shouldn't be seeing
anypony right now.

11:36.535 --> 11:39.425
In fact, I'm getting more
upset just thinking about it.

11:39.765 --> 11:40.745
Excuse me!

11:43.235 --> 11:46.875
Oh, what in the frilly
fumidila has gotten into you?!

11:47.040 --> 11:50.065
Sorry, Granny! I just
decided if I helped you,

11:50.250 --> 11:51.535
it would go faster.

11:51.730 --> 11:54.655
Well, you're too late.
All the sprayers are here.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.630
Oh, good. Uh say, Granny,

12:00.865 --> 12:03.240
when did you first fight
the apple blight again?

12:03.820 --> 12:08.040
It was my second year
here in Ponyville

12:08.145 --> 12:12.620
and that was before I had
the rick on the one knee.

12:12.825 --> 12:16.565
...and others say that's how the
trees got to growing so tall,

12:16.795 --> 12:19.680
but to me, it's just
how I got my cutie mark.

12:19.965 --> 12:23.580
But we asked when we could
come back to see Granny!

12:24.445 --> 12:26.105
Big Mac didn't
want to be rude,

12:26.165 --> 12:30.455
but you just can't see Granny
right now because she's...

12:31.570 --> 12:32.675
...got apple blight!

12:32.870 --> 12:36.215
I thought only trees
got the blight.

12:36.610 --> 12:39.415
Yeah, that's
usually the case.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.465
The doctors think it's from
working in the orchard

12:42.495 --> 12:43.840
for so many years.

12:45.595 --> 12:48.920
You see. We had to take
Granny to Ponyville General.

12:49.110 --> 12:51.420
We just got back right
before you showed up.

12:51.785 --> 12:54.555
Oh my, that is terrible!

12:54.705 --> 12:57.810
Eww, it's not
contagious, is it?

12:57.975 --> 13:01.330
Um, I'm sure you'll be
fine, but you should leave,

13:01.435 --> 13:03.355
just in case.

13:05.085 --> 13:08.315
You're right. We're gonna have
to hurry if we want to get there

13:08.340 --> 13:10.390
before visiting hours are over.

13:10.870 --> 13:13.420
That's right. Wait. Get where?

13:13.905 --> 13:15.840
Why, the hospital, of course.

13:15.985 --> 13:17.925
I'm sure we'll see you there!

13:23.925 --> 13:25.970
Telling Filthy Rich that
Granny's in the hospital

13:26.020 --> 13:28.135
just made everything
a hundred times worse!

13:28.205 --> 13:29.915
What are we supposed to do now?

13:31.170 --> 13:31.965
I got it!

13:32.930 --> 13:35.775
...dropped my second best
teeth right in the pig pen

13:35.885 --> 13:40.300
and that was the worst case of
apple blight I've ever seen!

13:40.390 --> 13:41.965
I'd love to hear
more Granny,

13:41.990 --> 13:44.110
but we gotta get to the
hospital right away!

13:44.460 --> 13:47.295
The hospital?
Why, who's sick?

13:47.520 --> 13:49.225
You are, apparently.

13:49.820 --> 13:53.065
What he means is, you're
needed at the hospital.

13:53.695 --> 13:55.075
Whatever for?

13:56.570 --> 13:59.880
It's the apple blight! It's
starting to infect ponies now!

14:00.020 --> 14:03.415
The doctors need an expert
opinion, and nopony knows more

14:03.450 --> 14:05.720
about fighting blight
than Granny Smith!

14:06.425 --> 14:09.820
Well, what in tarnation are
we waiting for? Let's go!

14:18.090 --> 14:21.540
You know, we're supposed
to go in the back.

14:21.615 --> 14:24.955
Uh, to avoid anypony in the
waiting room with the blight.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.685
Oops, I almost forgot!

14:34.335 --> 14:35.145
This is perfect.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.785
Now you don't have to worry
about catching the blight.

14:38.030 --> 14:39.790
If you say so, dearie.

14:39.910 --> 14:43.660
Now you wait right here while
I... check on your presentation.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.295
What in the rotten
rhubarb's going on here?

14:49.060 --> 14:51.065
Fancy meeting you two here!

14:51.340 --> 14:53.810
Well, we told you
we were coming.

14:53.955 --> 14:57.785
Oh, I'm glad we found you
because I can't seem to find

14:57.820 --> 15:00.905
Granny's room, or any
nurses who've even heard

15:00.935 --> 15:02.930
about a pony with
apple blight.

15:03.205 --> 15:06.705
Granny's room. Sure. Just
go down here, take a left,

15:06.820 --> 15:09.615
then a right, go down some
stairs, up a bunch more stairs,

15:09.695 --> 15:11.670
through the cafeteria,
left three more times

15:11.710 --> 15:15.775
and then you're there. Easy as
Granny's apple pie! Heh heh.

15:16.885 --> 15:18.400
Aren't you coming with us?

15:18.545 --> 15:21.080
I'll catch up! I
gotta find Big Mac.

15:23.095 --> 15:26.260
OK, Granny, just wait here
one second and we can go.

15:26.805 --> 15:28.280
Where are you
two going?

15:28.350 --> 15:30.190
Big Mac can't come.
He, uh...

15:30.575 --> 15:31.720
...might be contagious.

15:31.950 --> 15:33.440
Contagious?

15:36.650 --> 15:38.425
All right. Climb up here
and I'll cover you up.

15:38.535 --> 15:40.655
Then I'll bring Rich in,
tell him you're Granny,

15:40.870 --> 15:42.355
but you're not allowed
to take the sheets off.

15:42.465 --> 15:44.965
You moan a few times, he leaves,
and this whole thing is over.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.895
This is spinnin' way out
of control, Applejack!

15:48.200 --> 15:50.480
Now I know you thought selling
cider in Filthy's store

15:50.505 --> 15:53.425
was a good idea, but it
ain't worth lying to him

15:53.440 --> 15:56.235
about Granny being sick and
needin' to go to the hospital,

15:56.505 --> 15:59.165
or fibbin' to Granny about
them wanting her to come here

15:59.220 --> 16:00.695
to talk about the blight, or--

16:00.735 --> 16:04.165
BIG MACINTOSH, PLEASE JUST
LISTEN TO ME FOR ONCE!

16:04.620 --> 16:06.380
This ain't about my ideas!

16:06.540 --> 16:08.535
If Rich finds out
about all the lies,

16:08.640 --> 16:11.145
he'll cut ties with us and
the farm will go under.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.065
Now do you want that to
happen or do you wanna help?

16:14.485 --> 16:16.325
Why can't you be Granny?
You're her size,

16:16.355 --> 16:17.755
and this is all your fault
in the first place!

16:17.990 --> 16:20.685
I would, but if I let
you do the talkin',

16:20.770 --> 16:23.210
you'd just ramble on and on
until we all got caught.

16:25.995 --> 16:27.700
Just lay down, keep still

16:27.790 --> 16:30.900
and promise me you won't say
anything for once in your life.

16:31.450 --> 16:32.660
Eeyup.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.005
Granny!

16:39.745 --> 16:40.545
Granny.

16:41.555 --> 16:44.290
It's about time. What
is going on around here?

16:45.050 --> 16:47.980
Granny, they need you to wait
here. I'll come get you.

16:50.085 --> 16:53.160
There you are! We've
been going in circles

16:53.185 --> 16:54.800
looking for Granny's room!

16:55.120 --> 16:58.360
Well, you're in luck, 'cause
it's, it's right over here

16:58.485 --> 17:00.850
and this time I'll make
sure you don't get lost.

17:06.405 --> 17:07.745
What in the dadgum?

17:08.090 --> 17:09.810
What now?

17:10.120 --> 17:13.235
He-- I mean, "she"
was right here!

17:13.970 --> 17:15.585
Oh no! We gotta go!

17:17.855 --> 17:20.085
Is that
Granny Smith?

17:20.180 --> 17:22.120
Where are they
taking her?

17:24.590 --> 17:26.330
You two, don't lose
that gurney!

17:27.700 --> 17:30.475
Granny, what're you doin'? You
were supposed to stay there!

17:30.860 --> 17:32.935
It was a supply closet!

17:33.545 --> 17:37.365
Oh! Uh, well, OK, come
with me, but be quiet.

17:37.445 --> 17:40.635
You know, save your voice
for the big presentation.

18:01.560 --> 18:05.385
I'm sorry, but you can't get any
closer without a gown and mask.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.420
But-- but-but that's
my brother on there!

18:09.175 --> 18:11.850
Don't worry. This
is our best doctor.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.750
She'll have your brother back
on his hooves in no time.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.765
Now, apple blight is
a serious disease.

18:21.955 --> 18:25.215
Now then? Did she say
"apple blight?"

18:25.720 --> 18:27.985
I think she said
"gasket mites."

18:28.260 --> 18:31.680
And once the trunk
turns red like this,

18:31.850 --> 18:34.975
the only thing to do
is prune the branches.

18:35.290 --> 18:37.695
Oh no! Granny!

18:38.870 --> 18:41.820
Did you say "prune
the branches?"

18:42.060 --> 18:43.655
Well, sure. What
else you gonna do

18:43.680 --> 18:45.575
once the blight
gets this bad?

18:56.390 --> 18:58.130
Everypony just stop!

18:58.360 --> 19:00.675
This is all a big
misunderstanding.

19:01.485 --> 19:03.955
Actually, it's a big lie!

19:07.550 --> 19:08.755
Big Mac?

19:09.295 --> 19:13.360
Granny Smith? What is
going on here, Applejack?

19:13.765 --> 19:16.395
That is a darn
good question.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.395
I'm not sure if I was worried
that nopony was listening

19:21.425 --> 19:24.410
to my ideas or just nervous
that I wouldn't be the one

19:24.435 --> 19:25.880
to end up running the farm,

19:26.010 --> 19:28.240
but I promised
something to Filthy Rich

19:28.280 --> 19:32.330
that I couldn't deliver and I
was too embarrassed to admit it.

19:32.635 --> 19:34.735
So Granny was never sick?

19:35.080 --> 19:38.110
And there ain't no
apple blight in ponies?

19:38.350 --> 19:39.510
Nope!

19:39.940 --> 19:43.785
Those were all lies. And I
thought if you found out,

19:43.935 --> 19:46.210
you'd stop doing
business with the farm,

19:46.405 --> 19:48.675
so I just kept
telling more.

19:49.205 --> 19:51.015
So, she's not a doctor?

19:51.435 --> 19:54.570
Please don't make Granny and
the farm suffer for what I did.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.985
This whole thing is my fault.

19:57.055 --> 19:59.060
That's not
entirely true.

19:59.310 --> 20:02.470
Maybe if I paid more attention
to what you had to say

20:02.510 --> 20:04.055
instead of talking
all the time,

20:04.205 --> 20:06.380
none of this would have
happened in the first place.

20:06.525 --> 20:10.015
I just need to talk
less and listen more...

20:10.375 --> 20:11.670
Especially to you.

20:12.690 --> 20:13.900
Thanks, big brother.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.170
And whether it's me running
Sweet Apple Acres or you,

20:17.380 --> 20:19.480
I know it'll be in good hooves.

20:20.255 --> 20:22.215
Well, that's nice, but I
don't know what in blazes

20:22.245 --> 20:23.520
you two are talking about.

20:23.670 --> 20:27.545
I ain't going anywhere anytime
soon. Pfft! Running the farm.

20:27.670 --> 20:30.920
Not after this
display. Not likely.

20:31.530 --> 20:35.655
And don't you go getting any
ideas about "cutting ties"

20:35.700 --> 20:40.025
with Sweet Apple Acres, or I'm
goin right to your grandpappy.

20:40.225 --> 20:40.820
Get me?

20:41.290 --> 20:43.155
Um... Yes, ma'am.

20:43.515 --> 20:48.050
Now, who here still wants to
hear about the apple blight?

20:48.975 --> 20:51.180
Now when I was a filly...

20:51.460 --> 20:54.320
I can't believe you
told all those lies!

20:54.520 --> 20:56.750
It's not a story I'm
proud of,

20:57.020 --> 21:00.650
but it taught me a lifelong
lesson about being honest.

21:00.755 --> 21:02.910
I hope you learned
something too.

21:03.165 --> 21:06.815
I sure did! I learned that
no pony starts out perfect

21:06.895 --> 21:09.240
and sometimes you gotta
make a few mistakes

21:09.280 --> 21:10.600
to figure out who you are.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.065
Eeyup!

21:12.495 --> 21:14.535
But I think the most
important thing I learned

21:14.565 --> 21:16.620
is who really runs
Sweet Apple Acres...

21:17.430 --> 21:18.665
Granny!

21:18.850 --> 21:21.920
Yer darn tootin'! Now everypony
quit yer lolly-gaggery

21:21.950 --> 21:27.430
and get back to work. Right
after we have a glass of cider!
