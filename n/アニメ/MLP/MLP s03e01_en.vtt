00:10.100 --> 00:11.550
News from Northern Equestria!

00:11.700 --> 00:13.550
Uh... your highness.

00:13.700 --> 00:14.330
Yes?

00:14.480 --> 00:18.280
I am simply to tell you that...
it has returned.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.330
Find Princess Cadance and Shining Armor.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.830
Yes, your highness.

00:25.630 --> 00:29.630
My dearest Twilight,
you must come to Canterlot at once.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.220
Where are all my quills?

01:17.470 --> 01:20.870
No, no, no, no, no... ugh!

01:21.020 --> 01:24.190
I need the Magical Compendium
volumes 1 to 36! Where is it?!

01:34.080 --> 01:36.390
Flash cards!
I should make some flash cards.

01:36.540 --> 01:38.560
Spike, I'm gonna need you to quiz me.

01:38.710 --> 01:41.720
On everything.
Everything I've ever learned. Ever.

01:43.380 --> 01:45.120
That isn't gonna be enough cards.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.870
Twilight, calm down.
It's just a test!

01:50.280 --> 01:52.080
Just a test?

01:53.440 --> 01:54.610
JUST A TEST?!

01:54.760 --> 01:57.130
Princess Celestia wants
to give me some kind of exam

01:57.280 --> 02:01.550
and you're trying to tell me to calm down
because... it's just a test?!

02:03.090 --> 02:04.430
Uh... yes?

02:06.480 --> 02:09.460
I'd say she's handling things
pretty well, considering.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.590
Are you sure you don't want me
to go as well?

02:18.740 --> 02:19.450
Yes.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.190
Princess Cadance and Shining Armor
are already there.

02:22.340 --> 02:24.280
The others will be joining them soon.

02:24.430 --> 02:28.540
The empire's magic is powerful.
It cannot fall again, my sister.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.860
She will succeed at her task.
And when she does,

02:32.010 --> 02:34.790
we'll know she is that much closer
to being ready.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.870
Trust me, little sister.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.710
You wanted to see me?
To give me a test?

02:45.100 --> 02:47.690
I brought my own quills.
And plenty of paper to show my work.

02:51.340 --> 02:53.060
Sorry, sorry!

02:54.360 --> 02:56.590
This is a different kind of test.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.230
The Crystal Empire has returned.

03:02.970 --> 03:04.660
The Crystal Empire?

03:04.810 --> 03:06.790
I'm sorry, I thought I'd studied.

03:07.370 --> 03:08.990
I don't think there's anything
in any of my books--

03:09.140 --> 03:10.360
There wouldn't be.

03:11.710 --> 03:14.530
Few remember it ever existed at all.

03:16.790 --> 03:19.310
Even my knowledge of
the empire is limited.

03:23.570 --> 03:27.220
What I do know is that
it contains a powerful magic.

03:27.470 --> 03:29.040
One thousand years ago,

03:29.190 --> 03:32.790
King Sombra, a unicorn
whose heart was black as night,

03:32.940 --> 03:34.930
took over the Crystal Empire.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.470
He was ultimately overthrown,

03:47.630 --> 03:51.700
turned to shadow and banished
to the ice of the arctic north.

03:55.970 --> 03:59.710
But not before he was able to
put a curse upon the empire.

03:59.860 --> 04:02.600
A curse that caused it
to vanish into thin air.

04:05.610 --> 04:09.010
If the empire is filled with
hope and love,

04:09.670 --> 04:13.140
those things are reflected
across all of Equestria.

04:13.350 --> 04:16.150
If hatred and fear take hold...

04:30.660 --> 04:33.870
Which is why I need your help
finding a way to protect it.

04:34.270 --> 04:37.920
You want me to help protect
an entire empire?

04:38.050 --> 04:41.460
It is, as I said, a different kind of test.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.890
But one I'm certain you will pass.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.210
How do I begin?

04:46.330 --> 04:49.900
By joining Princess Cadance and
Shining Armor in the Crystal Empire.

04:50.050 --> 04:51.420
My brother is there?

04:51.570 --> 04:55.140
He is. And your Ponyville friends
will join you there as well.

04:55.290 --> 04:58.220
I have every confidence
you will succeed.

04:58.370 --> 04:59.480
And when you do,

04:59.630 --> 05:03.450
I'll know you are ready to move on
to the next level of your studies.

05:06.970 --> 05:08.700
But what if I fail?

05:08.850 --> 05:09.560
You won't.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.910
But what if--

05:11.830 --> 05:14.650
You won't.
But Twilight,

05:15.750 --> 05:18.740
in the end, it must be you
and you alone

05:18.890 --> 05:21.840
who ultimately assists
Princess Cadance and Shining Armor

05:21.990 --> 05:24.760
in doing what needs to be done
to protect the empire.

05:25.380 --> 05:26.640
Do you understand?

05:27.920 --> 05:30.620
Then go. There is no time to lose.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.990
Ah! Twilight! That was fast!

05:38.140 --> 05:40.240
Let me guess, you got a perfect score?

05:42.100 --> 05:43.250
A minus?

05:44.400 --> 05:45.810
B plus?

05:48.630 --> 05:52.400
Twilight! Did you... fail?

05:54.020 --> 06:01.860
<i>I was prepared to do my best,
Thought I could handle any test </i>

06:02.340 --> 06:10.230
<i>For I can do so many tricks,
But I wasn't prepared for this </i>

06:20.050 --> 06:23.780
<i>Levitation would have been a breeze</i>

06:24.030 --> 06:27.480
<i>Facts and figures I recite with ease </i>

06:27.630 --> 06:29.100
The square root
of five hundred and forty-six

06:29.250 --> 06:32.230
is twenty-three point three six six six
four two eight nine one zero nine.

06:32.700 --> 06:33.920
She is correct!

06:34.430 --> 06:38.250
<i>I could ace a quiz on friendship's bliss </i>

06:38.390 --> 06:42.580
<i>But I wasn't prepared for this </i>

06:42.730 --> 06:48.520
<i>Will I fail, or will I pass?
I can't be sure...  </i>

06:48.670 --> 06:50.370
<i>She can't be sure... </i>

06:50.520 --> 06:56.600
<i>My mind is sharp, my skills intact
My heart is pure...</i>

06:56.750 --> 06:58.700
<i>Her heart is pure... </i>

06:58.850 --> 07:02.430
<i>Oh, I've taken my share of licks</i>

07:02.580 --> 07:06.400
<i>I've made it through the thin and thick </i>

07:06.550 --> 07:10.570
<i>- But no I wasn't
- Oh no, she wasn't </i>

07:10.720 --> 07:14.530
<i>- But no I wasn't
- Oh no, she wasn't </i>

07:14.680 --> 07:23.260
<i>No I wasn't prepared for this! </i>

07:30.020 --> 07:33.010
Uh, prepared for what exactly?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.290
Twilight!

07:35.200 --> 07:36.410
Did you pass?

07:37.250 --> 07:40.370
Are we gonna celebrate
your awesomeness with Princess Celestia?

07:40.890 --> 07:42.290
Not quite.

07:43.710 --> 07:46.960
We're going to the Crystal Empire!

08:04.050 --> 08:07.600
Ha! And you all made fun of me
for packing so many scarves.

08:08.340 --> 08:10.330
I didn't say a word.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.800
Twilight!

08:15.950 --> 08:17.210
Shining Armor?

08:19.870 --> 08:21.720
Twilie! You made it.

08:23.710 --> 08:25.170
We better get moving.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.980
There are things out here we really
don't want to run into after dark.

08:29.199 --> 08:30.570
What kind of things?

08:30.750 --> 08:32.550
Let's just say the empire...

08:32.700 --> 08:34.590
isn't the only thing that's returned.

08:38.490 --> 08:40.650
Something keeps trying to get in!

08:40.800 --> 08:44.070
We think it's the unicorn king
who originally cursed the place.

08:44.220 --> 08:48.650
But Princess Celestia said I was being sent
here to find a way to protect the empire!

08:48.800 --> 08:52.770
If King Sombra can't get in,
then it must already be protected.

08:55.610 --> 08:58.300
Th-That's one of the things, isn't it?!

08:58.450 --> 09:01.280
We have to get to
the Crystal Empire. Now!

09:12.820 --> 09:14.400
Go, go!

09:16.150 --> 09:17.400
Almost there.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.380
Everypony okay?

09:41.750 --> 09:44.520
Oh no, Shining Armor,
your horn!

09:51.510 --> 09:54.610
Sparklriffic!

09:59.760 --> 10:03.590
It's gorgeous!
Absolutely gorgeous!

10:06.600 --> 10:08.920
There are no words!

10:09.070 --> 10:11.790
Focus, Rarity.
We're here to help Twilight.

10:11.940 --> 10:13.650
Not admire the scenery.

10:13.800 --> 10:18.520
I don't see what the big deal is.
Just looks like another old castle to me.

10:19.770 --> 10:21.100
Another old...!

10:21.250 --> 10:23.750
Have you lost your mind?!
Look at the magn--

10:25.300 --> 10:26.590
Very funny.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.060
Cadance!

10:39.570 --> 10:45.100
Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake,
clap your hooves and do a little shake!

10:48.750 --> 10:51.090
One of these days,
we need to get together

10:51.240 --> 10:54.200
when the fate of Equestria
isn't hanging in the balance.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.450
Are you okay?

10:56.600 --> 10:59.540
Cadance has been able to use her magic
to spread love and light.

10:59.690 --> 11:01.850
That seems to be what is protecting it.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.600
But she hasn't slept, barely eats.

11:04.750 --> 11:08.650
I want to help her, but my protection spell
has been countered by King Sombra.

11:08.950 --> 11:11.530
It's alright Shining Armor, I'm fine.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.960
She's not fine.
She can't go on like this forever.

11:15.110 --> 11:16.550
And if her magic were to fade,

11:16.700 --> 11:19.400
you saw what's out there
waiting for that to happen.

11:19.550 --> 11:20.890
That's why we're here.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.550
Why we're all here.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.080
With Cadance putting all her strength
into keeping her spell going,

11:27.230 --> 11:30.060
and me trying to keep an eye
on signs of trouble in the arctic,

11:30.210 --> 11:33.450
we haven't been able to gather
much information from the Crystal Ponies.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.300
Crystal Ponies?!

11:35.900 --> 11:37.410
There are Crystal Ponies?!

11:40.840 --> 11:42.850
Please, continue.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.490
But we have to believe one of them
knows how we can protect the empire,

11:46.640 --> 11:48.810
without having to use
Cadance's magic.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.430
A research paper!

11:52.580 --> 11:54.760
That must be part of my test!

11:54.850 --> 11:58.340
To gather information from the
crystal ponies and deliver it to you!

11:58.490 --> 12:02.240
This is gonna be great!
I love research papers!

12:02.390 --> 12:04.650
Yeah, who doesn't?

12:04.800 --> 12:05.940
Ohohoh! Lemme guess!

12:06.100 --> 12:09.390
Is it Spike?!
No no, Fluttershy! Rarity?

12:09.950 --> 12:13.200
Don't worry, big brother.
I'm really good at this sort of thing.

12:15.050 --> 12:18.240
Are you sure? Absolutely sure?

12:18.390 --> 12:20.800
I'm sorry. I wish I could help you.

12:21.280 --> 12:25.250
But I can't seem to remember anything
before King Sombra came to power.

12:26.540 --> 12:30.040
And I don't want to remember anything
about the time he ruled over us.

12:31.030 --> 12:35.230
King Sombra's spell must be
why their coats aren't... crystally.

12:36.070 --> 12:38.520
Have we really been gone
a thousand years?

12:38.670 --> 12:39.520
Yes.

12:39.670 --> 12:42.640
It feels like it was just yesterday.

12:42.800 --> 12:46.010
If you think of anything,
even the smallest thing...

12:46.160 --> 12:47.440
Of course.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.400
That was a total bust.

12:50.550 --> 12:52.640
Maybe the others are having better luck.

12:53.050 --> 12:56.930
A way to protect the empire!
You know anything about it or what?!

12:57.080 --> 12:59.070
I wish I could help you. Really.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.300
Come on! You gotta know something!

13:03.450 --> 13:06.170
But... I don't have any information.

13:08.150 --> 13:10.450
Oh, um. Excuse me!

13:10.600 --> 13:13.880
Oh, hello!
I was just wondering...

13:19.080 --> 13:22.460
Oh, oh that's okay.
You all look really busy...

13:25.180 --> 13:27.970
Time to gather some intel!

13:30.230 --> 13:33.050
It just feels like something is missing.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.100
I know.

13:34.250 --> 13:38.400
It looks the same, but...
it doesn't feel the same.

13:38.850 --> 13:40.480
Because it isn't!

13:41.600 --> 13:42.760
A spy!

13:45.290 --> 13:48.550
A spy?!
How did they know?

13:48.950 --> 13:51.240
Ah! Must have noticed
my night vision goggles.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.970
Ooh! Night vision-ey!

13:59.480 --> 14:03.810
And when you flip your mane,
it simply must create a rainbow of color.

14:05.430 --> 14:08.280
Wouldn't I look just magnificent?

14:08.430 --> 14:10.360
So sparkly!

14:16.490 --> 14:18.570
I got nothing so far.

14:19.180 --> 14:20.750
Me neither.

14:24.420 --> 14:28.310
My cover has been blown.
I repeat, my cover has been blown!

14:28.460 --> 14:30.180
Ooookay.

14:30.330 --> 14:31.530
Sorry, Twilight,

14:31.680 --> 14:35.320
these crystal ponies seem to have
some kinda collective amnesia or somethin'.

14:35.470 --> 14:38.900
Only thing I was able to get out of 'em
was somethin' about a library.

14:39.360 --> 14:42.340
A library?
Why didn't you say so?!

14:42.490 --> 14:44.550
Uh... thought I just did.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.360
I just... I don't even know what to...

14:55.600 --> 14:57.820
There are no words.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.400
May I help you?

15:00.550 --> 15:02.410
Yes. We're looking for a book.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.480
We have plenty of those.

15:04.640 --> 15:08.000
You do. You really do!

15:08.490 --> 15:10.070
We're lookin' for a history book.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.990
Somethin' that may tells us how
the empire might've protected itself

15:13.140 --> 15:14.740
from danger back in the day.

15:14.890 --> 15:18.420
Yes, of course.
History, history...

15:18.570 --> 15:19.790
Ah, yes!

15:24.370 --> 15:26.930
Which is where, exactly?

15:27.090 --> 15:32.530
I... I can't seem to remember.
I'm not sure I actually work here.

15:33.630 --> 15:36.930
We'll just take a look around.
I'm sure we can find it on our own.

15:37.090 --> 15:39.020
Let me know if you find anything.

15:40.050 --> 15:42.190
I like her!

16:03.250 --> 16:05.830
Anyone else startin' to think
this is a lost cause?

16:05.980 --> 16:10.000
No, no, no, no,
no...

16:10.950 --> 16:12.310
YES!

16:15.190 --> 16:17.650
History of the Crystal Empire.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.350
I just hope it has
the answers we need.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.110
A 'Crystal Fair'.

16:28.260 --> 16:31.370
According to this book,
it was established by their first queen,

16:31.520 --> 16:33.790
and became their
most important tradition.

16:33.940 --> 16:36.070
The fair was held every year to

16:36.220 --> 16:39.100
renew the spirit of love
and unity in the empire

16:39.260 --> 16:41.040
so they could protect it from harm.

16:41.190 --> 16:44.990
My friends and I could put it together.
Everything we need to know is in the book!

16:45.140 --> 16:46.920
That sounds pretty promising.

16:48.530 --> 16:50.230
We'll get started right away.

16:50.380 --> 16:53.750
Come on, Spike.
We've got a Crystal Fair to put together!

17:04.450 --> 17:10.040
<i>Princess Cadance needs our help,
Her magic will not last forever </i>

17:10.190 --> 17:14.750
<i>I think we can do it,
But we need to work together </i>

17:14.900 --> 17:19.540
<i>We have to get this right,
Yes we have to make them see </i>

17:19.690 --> 17:25.410
<i>We can save the Crystal Ponies
with their history </i>

17:25.720 --> 17:28.590
<i>It says that they like jousting </i>

17:30.090 --> 17:33.220
<i>They flew a flag of many hues </i>

17:34.100 --> 17:37.530
<i>Made sweets with crystal berries </i>

17:38.550 --> 17:41.680
<i>They had a petting zoo with tiny ewes</i>

17:41.960 --> 17:46.570
<i>Oh we have to get this right,
Yes we have to make them see </i>

17:46.580 --> 17:50.690
<i>We can save the Crystal Ponies
with their history </i>

17:51.250 --> 17:55.400
<i>There was a crystal flugelhorn</i>

17:55.700 --> 17:59.150
<i>That everypony liked to play </i>

18:00.040 --> 18:03.230
<i>And the Crystal Kingdom anthem </i>

18:03.380 --> 18:07.560
<i>Can you learn it in a day? </i>

18:07.710 --> 18:11.850
<i>Oh we have to get this right,
Yes we have to make them see </i>

18:12.050 --> 18:16.170
<i>We can save the Crystal Ponies</i>

18:16.320 --> 18:22.820
<i>With their history </i>

18:27.350 --> 18:29.150
It looks amazing!

18:29.300 --> 18:31.790
I don't know how
I could have done this without you!

18:32.200 --> 18:34.600
One last check to make sure
everything is in place,

18:34.750 --> 18:36.500
and then the festivities can begin!

18:36.650 --> 18:37.900
What's this thing for?

18:39.620 --> 18:43.070
The last page of the book mentioned
a Crystal Heart as the fair's centerpiece.

18:43.220 --> 18:46.010
So I used my magic to cut one
out of a crystal block.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.450
Nice work, Twi.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.820
Think we're ready to get
this fair up and runnin'.

19:01.690 --> 19:03.620
Hear ye, hear--

19:09.420 --> 19:10.790
My bad.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.450
Hear ye, hear ye.
Princess Cadance

19:16.500 --> 19:18.700
and Prince Shining Armor
do cordially

19:18.850 --> 19:21.690
invite you to attend
the Crystal Fair!

19:30.790 --> 19:32.180
Come on in, y'all.

19:32.330 --> 19:35.350
Got food and drinks thataway,
games and crafts are thataway,

19:35.500 --> 19:37.950
Crystal Heart to the back
near the Princess.

19:43.820 --> 19:45.690
We totally nailed it, right?

19:46.550 --> 19:49.220
Must be feeling a lot of love
and unity about now!

19:50.930 --> 19:52.190
Gonna have some grub, huh?

19:52.340 --> 19:55.000
What are you picking?
Crystal Empire berry pie?

19:55.150 --> 19:56.800
Maybe some crystal corn-on-the-cob!

19:58.230 --> 20:00.880
What is with these ponies?!

20:01.030 --> 20:05.290
Seeing all of this, I feel like
I'm starting to remember.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.850
Remember things from before the king.

20:08.020 --> 20:09.250
Me too.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.140
The Crystal Heart!

20:13.300 --> 20:14.650
Do you think they really have it?

20:14.800 --> 20:16.550
Of course we have it!

20:16.700 --> 20:19.470
Can't have a Crystal Fair
without the Crystal Heart, right?

20:19.620 --> 20:21.550
Of course you can't.

20:22.470 --> 20:26.410
The whole purpose of the Crystal Fair
is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies,

20:26.560 --> 20:28.380
so the light within them
can power the Crystal Heart,

20:28.530 --> 20:30.440
so that the empire can be protected!

20:30.990 --> 20:33.240
I do work at a library!

20:33.390 --> 20:36.040
What's that about
'powering the heart'?

20:36.190 --> 20:38.080
I just can't believe you found it.

20:38.240 --> 20:41.440
King Sombra said he'd hidden it away,
where we would never see it again!

20:41.590 --> 20:44.990
I only hope it will still be
as powerful after all these years!

20:45.490 --> 20:47.170
Mm, funnelcake!

20:52.550 --> 20:53.340
Why did you...?

20:53.490 --> 20:56.050
I think we may have a problem!

20:56.960 --> 20:59.090
I didn't know it was an actual relic!

20:59.240 --> 21:02.510
The book didn't mention anything about
the Crystal Ponies powering the Heart!

21:03.170 --> 21:06.370
There was a page missing...
how did I not notice?!

21:07.100 --> 21:09.200
It's alright, Twilight.

21:11.790 --> 21:13.220
Twilie...
