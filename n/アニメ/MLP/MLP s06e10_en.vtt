WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:08.240
Ahhhhhh!

00:10.400 --> 00:14.420
Miss Rarity? How much
longer are you planning

00:14.460 --> 00:16.100
to stay in here, darling?

00:16.560 --> 00:19.300
Oh, dear, is somepony
else waiting?

00:19.540 --> 00:22.350
No, no. I just don't
want you to get all,

00:22.400 --> 00:23.960
what is word, pruney.

00:24.320 --> 00:28.320
Oh. Well, I'm just waiting for
Applejack. It's been so long

00:28.360 --> 00:30.640
since we've had a relaxing
day at the spa together.

00:30.940 --> 00:33.030
I'm quite certain she'll be
along any moment.

00:41.240 --> 00:44.410
Hey, there, Rarity. I really
tried to get here earlier.

00:44.460 --> 00:46.280
I just can't believe how
much time my chores

00:46.360 --> 00:47.400
are taking up these days.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.740
At least now we'll
finally get to spend some

00:49.800 --> 00:51.900
quality spa time
together, right?

00:52.450 --> 00:55.480
OK fillies, that's it. We're
closing up for the day.

00:57.080 --> 01:01.040
Aw, shucks, Rarity. I guess
I missed the whole day.

01:01.290 --> 01:02.460
I sure am sorry.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.140
Me too.

01:13.140 --> 01:21.280

We have muffins!

01:51.310 --> 01:52.000
Hi, Rarity.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.740
Morning, Twilight. Spike.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.380
Good heavens that's a
lot of empty pie plates.

01:56.620 --> 02:00.880
Uh, yeah. We were just heading
to pick up some fresh pies.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.720
I don't know why we keep
running out at the castle.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.620
What are you
going to get?

02:07.640 --> 02:08.840
Applejack,
actually.

02:08.940 --> 02:12.180
Although I'm quite sure
she'll be too busy once again.

02:12.460 --> 02:13.380
What do you mean?

02:13.700 --> 02:16.330
Oh, nothing. It's just
that Applejack and I

02:16.380 --> 02:18.870
haven't had one of our
spa days in ages.

02:18.940 --> 02:20.880
You two really should set
aside some time.

02:21.300 --> 02:24.100
Darling, I have been
trying for moons,

02:24.260 --> 02:27.780
but Applejack is so busy these
days, it's next to impossible.

02:27.910 --> 02:31.020
Wow. I didn't realize Applejack
had so much to do.

02:45.890 --> 02:48.440
Hey, Applejack. Another
order of pies, please.

02:48.700 --> 02:49.830
Sure thing, Spike.

02:51.860 --> 02:54.240
Agh!

02:54.340 --> 02:56.740
I don't suppose those
pies are the last chore

02:56.780 --> 02:58.480
on the schedule for today?

02:58.710 --> 03:02.340
Gah! Land sakes! Is it time
for our spa day already?

03:04.920 --> 03:08.450
Rarity, why don't you go on
ahead and I'll meet you there?

03:10.040 --> 03:13.540
Ugh! Please, Applejack,
let's not kid ourselves.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.920
Well, it ain't 'cause
I don't wanna,

03:16.000 --> 03:17.840
but the work on the farm
has just been taking up

03:17.860 --> 03:19.100
more and more of my time.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.260
I hate seeing you two not
spending time together.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.436
Can't you get somepony
else in your family

03:24.460 --> 03:25.540
to take over for a bit?

03:26.400 --> 03:29.200
Wish I could, but Granny,
Big Mac and Apple Bloom

03:29.400 --> 03:31.840
all have chores of their own
and today they're all busy

03:31.880 --> 03:33.160
taking the harvest
to market.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.180
I know we're not farmers,
but I'm sure Spike and I

03:37.220 --> 03:38.740
could handle things
for a little while.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.719
Maybe.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.720
Is there one chore
we could do?

03:44.160 --> 03:47.520
Well...I suppose if
you two got started

03:47.540 --> 03:48.980
on feeding the pigs,

03:49.200 --> 03:51.400
I could maybe leave
for an hour.

03:51.620 --> 03:54.220
An hour of
spa perfection?

03:54.360 --> 03:55.480
I can work with that!

03:55.780 --> 03:57.840
Perfect. You head
off to the spa

03:57.900 --> 03:59.830
and Spike and I will take
care of things here.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.980
Whoa! Ugh! Whoa!

04:03.540 --> 04:07.360
Uh yeah. We've totally
got everything covered.

04:11.010 --> 04:13.700
OK. This list pretty
much covers everything

04:13.760 --> 04:15.040
you need to know
to feed the pigs,

04:16.300 --> 04:19.880
but uh, maybe I should go
over it with you just to--

04:20.720 --> 04:23.620
Applejack, please, if
there's a list involved,

04:23.660 --> 04:25.840
I am one hundred
percent on top of it.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.899
Uh, right.

04:30.140 --> 04:31.800
And don't worry
about things here.

04:31.870 --> 04:34.220
Spike and I have
totally got this!

04:34.360 --> 04:37.800
I mean, it's just feeding
the pigs. How hard can it be?

04:38.760 --> 04:40.020
Uh... Twilight?

04:41.580 --> 04:42.420
Whoa!

04:43.080 --> 04:44.820
I'm glad we're
doing this, Rarity.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.780
I've been putting work before
our spa time for too long.

04:48.022 --> 04:49.721
I know we've only
got an hour,

04:49.780 --> 04:51.340
but I can't wait
to have a steam.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.900
A steam is just
the start.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.560
I know exactly
what we'll do

04:54.620 --> 04:56.400
and an hour will
be simply perfect.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.680
OK, Spike. Ready
with that list?

05:00.380 --> 05:01.080
Ready!

05:01.380 --> 05:02.720
Let's do this!

05:03.180 --> 05:05.300
Step one, open the gate.

05:10.220 --> 05:12.770
OK. Step two, close the gate.

05:12.920 --> 05:13.700
Huh?

05:13.840 --> 05:15.640
Mmm. That's what it says.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.140
Step three, walk away.

05:19.740 --> 05:21.850
Walk away? Really?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.880
I just hope Twilight and
Spike can handle things

05:25.940 --> 05:27.020
until I get back.

05:27.690 --> 05:28.740
Now, Applejack,

05:28.980 --> 05:31.360
if we are really to enjoy
this time together,

05:31.600 --> 05:33.930
you simply must give
yourself over to the idea

05:33.980 --> 05:37.040
that you are off duty
and try to relax.

05:37.520 --> 05:41.100
I know. You're right. I really
am glad we're doing this.

05:41.220 --> 05:43.080
And as long as
it's only an hour,

05:43.280 --> 05:45.640
I'm sure everything
will be just fine.

05:45.820 --> 05:51.380
Exactly. Now, kindly step
this way. Relaxation awaits.

05:58.660 --> 06:01.560
Rainbow Dash?
What are you doing here?

06:02.880 --> 06:05.260
Yeah. I didn't think
spa treatments

06:05.300 --> 06:06.790
were your thing exactly.

06:06.900 --> 06:07.890
What?

06:10.300 --> 06:12.320
Oh. They're totally not.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.260
At least, not the
"frou-frou" kind.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.560
Ah.

06:16.180 --> 06:19.100
Yeah, I-uh, I think
I tweaked something

06:19.140 --> 06:21.060
at Wonderbolts practice
the other day.

06:21.260 --> 06:23.980
I just came in for a deep
tissue sports massage.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.200
Ah, Miss Dash? I
am so sorry,

06:27.260 --> 06:29.780
but we are running
just a tad behind

06:29.860 --> 06:31.840
and we're not quite
ready to start your

06:31.890 --> 06:35.840
pampered muzzle massage and
indulgent hooficure just yet.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.280
Oh.

06:41.420 --> 06:44.380
I-I'm pretty sure that
wasn't what I signed up for.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.900
But they are your usuals-

06:47.940 --> 06:50.260
And it seems like you're
really busy today anyway.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.860
I'll just come back tomorrow.

06:51.940 --> 06:53.960
Uh, see you two
later. Have fun.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.540
But put me down for
the same thing.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.520
Too bad Rainbow
Dash just "hates" those

07:03.860 --> 07:05.540
"frou-frou" spa treatments.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.660
She could have joined
us for a nice steam.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.460
Whoo wee! I can't wait.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.200
Indeed. Although if
they couldn't fit Dashie in,

07:13.400 --> 07:15.640
I wonder just how far
behind things are running.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.720
Obviously we're on a
very tight schedule.

07:28.820 --> 07:31.360
Well, maybe not everypony is
waiting for the steam room.

07:31.540 --> 07:34.380
Oh, no, no, that's exactly
what we're waiting for.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.680
Oh, I hope you're
not in a hurry.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.020
So every pony here
wants a steam bath?

07:48.200 --> 07:50.000
Well, the solution
is obvious.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.380
We'll simply have to start
our short time at the spa

07:52.420 --> 07:53.420
with something else.

07:53.580 --> 07:56.620
Huh! Nothin' doin'! I
came here to have a steam

07:56.680 --> 07:58.020
and that's just
what I'm gonna get.

07:58.340 --> 08:00.460
But-but it will take
most of our hour

08:00.500 --> 08:01.910
just to get through
this line.

08:02.340 --> 08:08.010
Rarity! My favorite
customer!

08:08.600 --> 08:11.050
And Appleyack!

08:11.900 --> 08:14.840
Well, it certainly has been
a long time since you two

08:14.900 --> 08:18.140
were here together. So
lovely to have you back.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.280
Well, I wish I
could say the same.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.020
Yes, the wait time
for the steam room

08:24.060 --> 08:26.270
certainly has been
getting worse lately.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.680
But I'm sure we'll be
able to accommodate

08:29.720 --> 08:31.180
your usual treatments.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.010
Not without my steam.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.920
Apparently Applejack won't
consider starting her time

08:35.960 --> 08:38.400
at the spa without a steam
and we only have an hour.

08:38.820 --> 08:40.050
That is a problem.

08:40.560 --> 08:42.680
Applejack, where are you going?

08:44.380 --> 08:47.290
Um... Why are y'all
just standing here?

08:47.800 --> 08:50.380
Ugh! Just waiting for
the steam to build up.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.800
Without steam, a steam
room's just a room

08:53.860 --> 08:56.120
and I've got plenty
of those at home...

08:56.260 --> 08:58.120
because I live in a mansion.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.280
It has been taking longer
for the steam to reach that

09:09.440 --> 09:11.720
"Ponyville Day Spa" quality.

09:12.140 --> 09:15.060
We even had to add a
warm towel service.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.800
So sorry for the
delay, everypony,

09:18.940 --> 09:20.380
please help yourselves.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.620
So, if you're not
getting enough steam,

09:31.860 --> 09:33.960
that must mean there's
not enough hot water.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.140
Oh Applejack, honestly,

09:36.180 --> 09:38.040
can't we just start
with a hooficure?

09:38.140 --> 09:39.640
We're going to
run out of time!

09:47.920 --> 09:48.940
Hmmm.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.520
Ha! Now, what do we have here?

10:10.880 --> 10:12.720
The laundry room, of course.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.620
And at this point, I'm
considering soaking my hooves

10:15.680 --> 10:18.160
in one of the machines so my
time here isn't a total loss.

10:18.380 --> 10:22.460
The Ponyville Day Spa prides
itself on sanitary conditions

10:22.620 --> 10:25.520
and fresh linens
are integral part.

10:25.640 --> 10:29.260
Well, sure, but have you
always run every single one

10:29.320 --> 10:32.060
of these here machines
full-bore, all day, every day?

10:32.340 --> 10:33.960
The answer is no...

10:34.240 --> 10:37.620
...but ponies sure do love
their warm towel service.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.180
Hmmm.

11:01.740 --> 11:03.890
You are all wanting towel?

11:04.200 --> 11:06.200
Looks to me like you
don't have any left.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.680
Well, like I said. Warm
towels are big hit.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.280
I think I figured
out the problem.

11:25.700 --> 11:28.300
You've got a small leak
and that means the steam

11:28.340 --> 11:30.150
takes just a little
longer to build up

11:30.500 --> 11:32.340
and while ponies wait,
they get cold.

11:33.340 --> 11:36.060
Cold ponies start wrapping
themselves in towels...

11:36.680 --> 11:38.960
...and all those dirty
towels have to be cleaned...

11:40.120 --> 11:43.160
...because Ponyville Day Spa
prides itself on cleanliness.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.280
Eh. What?

11:50.240 --> 11:53.500
Basically, losing steam
makes you use more towels.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.180
That means you do more laundry
which uses up the hot water

11:56.240 --> 11:57.940
you need to make more
steam so the problem

11:58.000 --> 11:58.960
just keeps getting worse.

12:00.380 --> 12:02.700
Oh.That makes sense. I see.

12:02.780 --> 12:05.780
Ah! I had no idea.

12:06.040 --> 12:06.700
Wonderful!

12:06.780 --> 12:09.200
Now that we've solved
the great steam mystery,

12:09.280 --> 12:10.580
we can finally get
back to our...

12:11.560 --> 12:15.000
significantly less than
an hour of relaxation.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.760
Rarity, are you kiddin'?

12:17.080 --> 12:18.860
I can't just leave
things like this.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.900
I'm gonna need my tools.

12:22.420 --> 12:22.940
Uh!

12:58.380 --> 13:00.420
Whoo! Now that
that leak's fixed,

13:00.580 --> 13:01.940
ponies won't get so cold

13:02.000 --> 13:05.140
they use up all those towels
and without all that laundry,

13:05.200 --> 13:07.400
there'll be plenty of hot
water for all the steam

13:07.420 --> 13:08.660
anypony could want.

13:10.020 --> 13:13.240
And I'll only have to be
doing wash once a day!

13:15.300 --> 13:19.200
Wow, Appleyack. Have you ever
considered a career

13:19.240 --> 13:22.920
in the spa industry? I'm sure
I can find something for you.

13:23.480 --> 13:27.720
No thanks. I'm just
relieved I can finally relax

13:27.780 --> 13:29.800
in the steam. What do
you say, Rarity?

13:30.500 --> 13:32.780
Mmm. It sounds lovely,
Applejack,

13:32.840 --> 13:34.620
but unfortunately...

13:34.740 --> 13:36.500
...you spent so much time
fixing the steam room

13:36.550 --> 13:38.280
we don't have any time
left to use it.

13:38.980 --> 13:42.160
Honestly, how in Equestria
did it never occur to you

13:42.200 --> 13:43.200
to check for leaks?

13:43.600 --> 13:46.640
There's just so many other
things to worry about.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.260
I suppose we get used
to the way things are

13:49.420 --> 13:51.660
and we don't realize
there was problem.

13:52.220 --> 13:55.440
You obviously need an outside
eye to evaluate the situation.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.720
It's lucky for you Applejack
is too stubborn to relax.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.760
Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity.

14:01.980 --> 14:03.620
We'll just have to
do this another day.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.280
Twilight and Spike should be
done feeding the pigs by now.

14:06.540 --> 14:09.010
Twilight is a very capable pony.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.720
I'm sure she can figure
out what to do next.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.280
Look, I know Twilight's a
princess and an alicorn,

14:15.340 --> 14:16.920
but she isn't a farmer.

14:17.220 --> 14:20.360
I've been doing farm work my
whole life and I'm not sure

14:20.420 --> 14:22.020
it's something you
can just figure out.

14:22.120 --> 14:26.960
Of course. Why don't
we pop back so you can explain

14:27.000 --> 14:29.440
to Twilight what to do next
and then we'll come back here

14:29.500 --> 14:30.620
and pick up where we left off?

14:31.460 --> 14:34.460
Well, I suppose I could try,

14:34.620 --> 14:36.700
assuming everything
went well so far.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.120
Oh, Applejack, honestly!
How could it not?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.350
Wouldn't it be
easier to just fly?

14:49.660 --> 14:52.800
I told you, Spike, we're
following Applejack's list

14:52.840 --> 14:55.380
to the letter and Applejack
doesn't fly--

14:56.980 --> 14:58.040
Aaaaah!

14:58.540 --> 14:59.340
Whoa!

15:07.700 --> 15:09.170
I'm sorry, Rarity,

15:09.320 --> 15:12.540
but I think I'm gonna have to
finish these chores myself.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.540
Twilight, darling, how in the
world did you end up there?

15:22.740 --> 15:25.300
Spike and I were just trying
to follow Applejack's list

15:25.360 --> 15:26.920
as closely as possible.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.300
Mmm...maybe not the best plan.

15:29.640 --> 15:30.940
I'm sorry, Applejack.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.860
But we never even got
started feeding the pigs.

15:34.860 --> 15:37.640
That's all right, Twilight.
I know you did your best.

15:38.460 --> 15:41.360
I guess a list can't really
capture all the ways I have

15:41.400 --> 15:42.370
of doin' things.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.820
At least you two got to spend
some time at the spa together.

15:45.980 --> 15:48.220
Yeah, that must have
been super relaxing.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.360
Well, if watching
Applejack fix plumbing

15:51.420 --> 15:53.280
counts as relaxing, then yes.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.120
What about your hour
of spa perfection?

15:56.280 --> 16:00.000
As it turns out, the Ponyville
Day Spa had a few problems

16:00.040 --> 16:03.700
with their steam room and
somepony refused to relax

16:03.740 --> 16:04.980
until she had fixed them.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.660
I'm sorry, but I just
couldn't let those spa ponies

16:09.700 --> 16:11.420
go another minute putting
up with problems

16:11.460 --> 16:12.800
they didn't even know they had.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.380
Somehow they just got used to
a huge bottleneck of ponies

16:17.420 --> 16:18.940
standin' around waitin'.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.420
But I took one good
look at that spa-jam

16:21.500 --> 16:23.080
and I knew I had
to do something.

16:23.380 --> 16:26.240
Sometimes the simplest
things can just derail

16:26.280 --> 16:27.260
a whole operation.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.680
Whether it's a leaky pipe
or doing too much laundry,

16:32.880 --> 16:35.180
you can't just stick to the
same old way of doing things

16:35.220 --> 16:36.700
and expect them to get better.

16:41.720 --> 16:45.420
I mean, thinking you can is
just plum ridiculous, right?

16:47.300 --> 16:50.260
It's funny when
you realize the extra work

16:50.300 --> 16:52.600
they were doing was actually
making things worse.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.820
I mean, I guess it's possible
to get stuck in a routine

17:06.860 --> 17:08.120
where you're doing all
this extra stuff

17:08.160 --> 17:09.040
and not realize it,

17:09.280 --> 17:11.260
but I can't for the life
of me think of how.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.200
Why are y'all starin'
at me like that?

17:15.400 --> 17:19.240
Um, are you certain
everything you just did

17:19.300 --> 17:21.720
is entirely necessary
to feed the pigs?

17:22.140 --> 17:26.160
What? Of course! Why would
I be doin' it if it weren't?

17:27.760 --> 17:29.700
See this gate here used
to squeak so loud,

17:29.780 --> 17:31.380
the pigs would run to the
other side of the pen

17:31.440 --> 17:32.320
and never come out,

17:32.460 --> 17:34.780
so I open and close it to
let them know it's safe.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.680
But it doesn't squeak anymore.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.700
Of course not. I
fixed that ages ago.

17:41.220 --> 17:43.960
Then I realized putting a
little fright into 'em

17:44.020 --> 17:45.400
got them all hustlin'
out of the pen.

17:46.380 --> 17:47.920
They don't look
scared to me.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.880
Well, no, they got
used to it.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.900
Which is why I started doing
the chicken dance to show 'em

17:55.940 --> 17:57.520
that if they didn't get to
eatin' their food,

17:57.640 --> 17:58.700
the chickens would.

18:00.260 --> 18:01.660
Of course, being a chicken,

18:01.720 --> 18:03.120
I couldn't very
well open the gate.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.280
Getting the food bucket to
spill into the trough

18:06.340 --> 18:07.620
was just a happy accident

18:07.760 --> 18:09.640
because one time I left
it there by mistake.

18:10.620 --> 18:13.740
Uh Applejack, it seems like
everything you're doing

18:13.800 --> 18:16.300
is to fix things that aren't
really problems anymore.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.430
Well, I'll be.

18:20.940 --> 18:23.560
Hm. Maybe it isn't so
hard to get stuck

18:23.640 --> 18:25.500
doing extra work after all.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.520
Huh, I wonder if I've been
doing that around here

18:28.560 --> 18:29.500
with anything else?

18:29.780 --> 18:32.160
Well, there's only
one way to find out!

19:59.800 --> 20:03.260
Thanks y'all. I
guess I just got so used

20:03.300 --> 20:04.760
to doing everything
a certain way,

20:04.880 --> 20:07.080
I didn't realize there
were any problems.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.100
Having a friend look
at what you're doing

20:09.140 --> 20:11.220
with an outside eye
can really help.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.840
Um-hm. And I suppose
if it weren't for our

20:13.880 --> 20:15.540
unsuccessful time at the spa,

20:15.640 --> 20:17.280
none of us would
have realized it.

20:17.820 --> 20:20.620
Well, now that your
chores are streamlined,

20:20.680 --> 20:22.500
what are you going to do
with all the extra time?

20:22.840 --> 20:24.920
I think I have a few ideas.

20:26.060 --> 20:28.480
Think you can come
up with enough things

20:28.540 --> 20:30.940
for us to do now that we have
more time to relax?

20:31.180 --> 20:34.580
Oh please, I could plan a
week's worth of treatments.

20:35.020 --> 20:36.820
Huh. Well, let's
just start with the

20:36.860 --> 20:37.940
rest of the day for now.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.000
After all the work we
just did on the farm,

20:40.100 --> 20:43.100
I am ready for some
serious relaxation.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.720
Thanks for letting me
know there was an opening.

20:46.940 --> 20:48.720
I don't know if I could
make it without my

20:48.780 --> 20:50.580
pampered muzzle massage.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.940
Don't worry about it.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.580
Shall I put you down for
another one tomorrow?

20:54.800 --> 20:56.580
Oh, absolutely.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.900
Sometimes a girl just has to
pamper herself, am I right?

21:00.360 --> 21:02.240
<i>You</i>
<i>certainly are.</i>

21:02.280 --> 21:07.940
Oh. Oh! Hey! I
was just, uh, uh...

21:08.060 --> 21:10.980
Getting a "sports"
pamperin'?

21:11.820 --> 21:14.280
Don't
worry, Rainbow Dash.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.500
We were just heading in for
some pampering ourselves.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.380
You could always join us.

21:18.620 --> 21:20.720
That is if you don't mind
suffering through

21:20.760 --> 21:22.860
one or two "frou-frou"
treatments.

21:23.180 --> 21:28.160
Ah, I suppose I could take
it. You know, for you ponies.

21:31.400 --> 21:31.780
Busted!

21:31.820 --> 21:32.100
Yeah.
