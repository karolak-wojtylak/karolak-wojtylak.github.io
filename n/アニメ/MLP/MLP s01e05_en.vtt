WEBVTT

00:01.350 --> 00:03.002
Hoof-biting action overload!

00:03.071 --> 00:06.140
She was like a stunt superstar.
Flying higher and higher...

00:06.238 --> 00:08.347
...and then Rainbow Dash
swoopped down SWOOSH...

00:08.518 --> 00:11.404
...and right before she hit the ground,
SHOOM she pulled up WROOM!

00:12.643 --> 00:16.845
And then she looped around and around like
WHOO WHOO WHOO WHOO
WHOO WHOO WHOO...!

00:26.129 --> 00:27.529
Rainbow Dash!

00:30.417 --> 00:32.523
Pinkie Pie? Not again...

00:34.273 --> 00:37.662
-Rainbow Dash!
-Not now, Pinkie Pie!

00:37.920 --> 00:39.178
But... but Rainbow Dash!

00:39.314 --> 00:40.919
I'm in the middle of something!

00:41.127 --> 00:43.204
-But...
-I said NOT NOW!

00:47.833 --> 00:49.855
I was gonna tell you to
look out for that mountain.

01:43.236 --> 01:45.516
Hi! I'm looking for Rainbow Dash.
Have you seen her?

01:46.786 --> 01:49.840
Hi there! Have you seen Rainbow Dash?
...Okay, thanks anyway.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.230
Twilight! Have you seen
Rainbow Dash anywhere?

01:52.288 --> 01:53.456
Isn't she right up there?

01:54.400 --> 01:56.276
Rainbow Dash!

02:09.978 --> 02:11.099
That was close...

02:11.100 --> 02:12.219
Hi!

02:26.735 --> 02:28.135
Hi again!

02:43.929 --> 02:45.479
I need a favor, Rainbow Dash.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.508
Oh, forget it.

02:49.720 --> 02:53.565
I toootally promise it
will be toootally fun!

02:54.627 --> 02:56.452
Oookay.

03:00.677 --> 03:01.863
Over to the right.

03:02.228 --> 03:05.469
No no, a little-little left... Wait! Back to the right.

03:06.756 --> 03:09.950
Now a little leftish while staying rightly.

03:10.471 --> 03:11.591
STOP!

03:13.490 --> 03:17.286
Maybe a few inches to the south!
Now a couple centimeters north...

03:17.599 --> 03:20.354
Okay... one more smidgemeter to the...

03:20.355 --> 03:21.755
PINKIE PIE!!!

03:22.055 --> 03:24.977
I mean... perfect! Now wait for my signal.

03:42.833 --> 03:46.037
Oh, Rainbow Dash. We startled
Spike into getting a hiccup!

03:48.494 --> 03:52.334
Good one, Pinkie *hic* Pie *hic*! You're
always pulling a fast one *hic* on me.

03:54.724 --> 03:56.881
Oh no! You're not hurt, are you?

03:56.934 --> 04:00.489
Na*hic*ah... Don't be *hic* silly *hic*!
Dragons are *hic* fireproof!

04:04.670 --> 04:06.691
Oh. Okay. Good.

04:10.816 --> 04:13.578
I wish the same thing *hic*
were true of scrolls.

04:21.149 --> 04:24.064
Have you ever seen anything more hilarious?

04:24.813 --> 04:26.974
I can think of one thing.

04:35.222 --> 04:37.649
I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie.

04:37.749 --> 04:42.575
Are you *hic* kidding?! *hic* I LOVE
to pull pranks! It's all *hic* in good fun.

04:42.675 --> 04:46.221
And Pinkie Pie lo*hic*oves
to have *hic* fun! *hic*

04:46.253 --> 04:49.069
You know, Pinkie Pie? You're
not as annoying as I thought!

04:49.814 --> 04:51.070
You wanna hang out?

04:51.938 --> 04:57.857
That'd be... *HIC* I'd really... *HIC* When do...
*HIC* I mean... *HIC* Where would you...

04:58.352 --> 04:59.828
A simple nod will do.

05:07.271 --> 05:11.206
-Is she even home?
-I don't know... There she goes...

05:11.870 --> 05:13.270
There she is!

05:58.051 --> 05:59.366
Land sakes!

06:21.358 --> 06:24.570
Is someone over there? Who're we gonna
squirt, who're we gonna squirt?

06:26.378 --> 06:28.229
-Fluttershy.
-WHAT?

06:29.188 --> 06:32.643
Nononononono...! We can't prank
Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive.

06:32.743 --> 06:35.462
It'll hurt her feelings.
Even the most harmless prank.

06:35.850 --> 06:37.499
Yeah, you're right.

06:38.525 --> 06:41.904
Huh. We need another victim,
who's made of tougher stuff.

06:42.168 --> 06:44.018
So... who's it gonna be?

06:44.267 --> 06:49.777
Oh! I've got someone in mind.
The toughest around.

06:49.874 --> 06:52.308
Oh, awesome! Who? Who? Do I know them?

06:53.256 --> 06:57.084
Oh yes! You're very close.

06:58.860 --> 07:00.746
Good one, Pinkie Pie!

07:17.661 --> 07:21.981
Rise and shine, Rainbow Dash! It's a brand
new day and we got a lot of pranking to...

07:24.527 --> 07:25.927
Morning, Pink!

07:26.039 --> 07:28.169
Gilda, this is my gal pal Pinkie Pie.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.756
Hey. Whazzup?

07:31.819 --> 07:33.900
Pinkie, this is my griffon friend Gilda.

07:34.060 --> 07:35.118
What's a griffon?

07:35.542 --> 07:39.479
-She's half-eagle, half-lion.
-And ALL AWESOME!

07:43.256 --> 07:46.639
Gilda's my best pal from my days
at the Junior Speedsters flight camp.

07:46.953 --> 07:48.292
Hey, remember the chant?

07:48.328 --> 07:53.310
Sure. They made us recite it every morning.
I'll never get that lame thing outta my head.

07:53.423 --> 07:55.301
Sooo...

07:57.988 --> 07:59.592
Only for you, Dash.

07:59.669 --> 08:03.871
<i>Junior Speedsters are our lives.
Skybound soars and daring dives</i>

08:04.005 --> 08:08.092
<i>Junior Speedsters, it's our quest
To someday be the very best!</i>

08:13.313 --> 08:16.407
Oh, that was awesome! And it gave
me a great idea for a prank!

08:17.036 --> 08:18.116
Gilda, you game?

08:18.546 --> 08:22.108
Huh. Well, I groove on a good prank
as much as the next griffon.

08:22.180 --> 08:25.956
But Dash! You promised me we'd get
a flying session in this morning.

08:26.112 --> 08:30.255
Yeah... Um... Well... Pinkie Pie,
you don't mind, do you?

08:30.752 --> 08:33.092
Gilda just got here.
We'll catch up with you later!

08:33.189 --> 08:35.762
Oh! Um... Sure, no problem!

08:35.873 --> 08:38.543
Have fun, you guys! I'll...
just catch up with you...

08:40.271 --> 08:41.671
...later.

08:57.788 --> 09:01.580
Wow! That was sweet! Just like old times.

09:02.145 --> 09:05.349
Yeah! Only faster. So now what?

09:05.521 --> 09:07.341
-Hey there...!
-Huh?

09:07.591 --> 09:10.194
...it's later...!
...and I caught up...!

09:14.420 --> 09:17.761
Pinkie Pie, you are so random!

09:19.871 --> 09:23.441
Hey Dash! Think you got enough gas
left to beat me to that cloud?

09:23.476 --> 09:25.788
A race? You are so on!

09:25.896 --> 09:28.021
One... two... three... GO!

09:28.110 --> 09:29.230
Hey...!

09:30.529 --> 09:33.662
-I win!
-As if! I won, dude!

09:33.782 --> 09:35.794
-No way!
-Yes way!

09:35.797 --> 09:38.597
Oh, come on! I was way ahead of you!

09:41.462 --> 09:43.319
Wow, guys, that was really cool!

09:43.435 --> 09:46.071
But I think Rainbow Dash beat you
by a teeny-weeny itty-bitty hair.

09:46.337 --> 09:47.835
Or a teeny-weeny itty-bitty feather.

09:48.879 --> 09:52.825
See? Good thing, Pinkie Pie's
here to keep you honest, G.

09:53.095 --> 09:58.027
Okay, Dash! Last one to that cloud
up there is an oily dragon egg.

09:58.133 --> 09:59.253
GO!

10:00.451 --> 10:03.399
I think the high altitude is making you dizzy.

10:06.322 --> 10:08.065
Wait! Guys!

10:11.009 --> 10:14.253
Wow! You guys almost got
away from me that time.

10:18.034 --> 10:23.863
So Dash. Got any new moves in your
tricktionary or are you 100% old school?

10:24.077 --> 10:28.440
New moves? Hah! Sit back, G.,
this is gonna take a while.

10:29.817 --> 10:32.724
-Hey, Pinkie. Come 'ere.
-Yeah?

10:34.144 --> 10:36.981
Don't you know how to take
"get lost" for an answer?

10:37.062 --> 10:39.982
Dash doesn't need to hang with
a dweeb like you now when I'm around.

10:40.048 --> 10:42.803
You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie.

10:43.095 --> 10:45.531
So make like a bee and BUZZ OFF!!!

10:51.513 --> 10:53.104
Try matching that!

10:53.495 --> 10:56.645
Hey! Where's Pinkie Pie and
her crazy contraption?

10:56.733 --> 11:01.300
Eh... She left. Something about
being as busy as a bee.

11:06.876 --> 11:11.160
So, Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this
friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?

11:11.161 --> 11:14.317
Um... Yeah! She keeps stealing
Rainbow Dash away...

11:14.469 --> 11:17.017
...she popped my balloons and
she told me to buzz off!

11:17.112 --> 11:20.205
I've never met a griffon this mean.
Or actually, I've never met a griffon at all.

11:20.331 --> 11:24.104
But I bet if I had, she wouldn't
be as mean and grumpy as Gilda!

11:24.295 --> 11:25.952
You know what I think, Pinkie Pie?

11:26.765 --> 11:30.501
-Well, I think... you're jealous.
-Jealous?!

11:30.696 --> 11:33.819
Green with envy. Well,
in your case pink with envy.

11:33.928 --> 11:36.088
Well, yes. Jealous.

11:36.450 --> 11:38.452
Listen, Pinkie, I don't wanna upset you...

11:38.563 --> 11:41.986
...but just because Rainbow Dash has
another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump.

11:42.278 --> 11:45.740
I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie,
who needs to improve her attitude.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.627
Improve MY attitude?!

11:47.814 --> 11:52.580
But I... It's Gilda that...
Are you serio... ARGH!

11:58.504 --> 12:03.441
Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda
isn't a big mean grumpy mean meanypants.

12:03.448 --> 12:07.548
Maybe I'm just a big jealous
judgmental jealous jealousypants.

12:15.694 --> 12:16.782
That was sweet!

12:17.309 --> 12:21.388
Uh. I gotta take care of a few weather
jobs around here. Shouldn't take long.

12:21.643 --> 12:23.761
Just hang out in town and I'll come find ya.

12:23.886 --> 12:26.480
That's cool, I guess. I'm gonna go chow down.

12:26.502 --> 12:27.622
Later!

12:34.086 --> 12:35.974
A rattler! A rattler!

12:36.333 --> 12:40.015
Run for the hills! Everybody protect yourselves!

12:44.369 --> 12:46.537
This stuff ain't fresh, dude!

12:46.587 --> 12:51.054
Aw, poor Granny Smith! She didn't know
it was a joke! How mean!

12:51.485 --> 12:55.824
No, no! I can't misjudge her!
It *was* kind of a funny prank.

12:56.159 --> 12:57.559
...I guess.

13:01.318 --> 13:06.128
I *did* misjudge her! She's not only
a meanie meanpants! She's also a thief!

13:07.407 --> 13:09.545
Nonononono... She might get it back!

13:09.810 --> 13:11.296
It's just a joke!

13:11.563 --> 13:14.618
All right, little one. This way. This way.

13:14.979 --> 13:16.895
Mama Duck, you're free and clear.

13:18.247 --> 13:19.356
Hey!

13:19.357 --> 13:21.913
-Please excuse me.
-I'm walking here!

13:22.014 --> 13:25.048
Oh... Um... I'm sorry.
I... I was just trying...

13:25.148 --> 13:27.456
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

13:27.556 --> 13:30.198
Why don't you just watch
where you're going, stupid?

13:30.972 --> 13:33.791
B... but... I... I...

13:43.119 --> 13:47.707
Please. All these lame ponies are
driving me buggy. I gotta bail.

13:49.053 --> 13:52.107
She's a grump AND a thief AND a bully!

13:52.143 --> 13:55.003
The meanest kind of mean meanypants there is!

13:55.207 --> 13:59.216
I can take it, but no one
treats Fluttershy like that!

13:59.277 --> 14:00.883
NO! ONE!

14:01.067 --> 14:05.430
This calls for extreme measure. Pinkie Pie style!

14:10.304 --> 14:13.316
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

14:13.805 --> 14:15.800
Who's this Gilda I've heard nothin' about?

14:15.995 --> 14:19.842
I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash.
A griffon. So rare...

14:19.942 --> 14:22.149
You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?

14:22.342 --> 14:26.222
Oh! Um... Well...
I'll tell you later, Twilight.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.588
Welcome! Welcome!

14:28.727 --> 14:31.755
Um... Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda...

14:32.021 --> 14:34.920
Um... Do you really think
it's a good idea? I mean...

14:35.029 --> 14:37.683
Don't worry your pretty little
head about mean old Gilda.

14:37.848 --> 14:40.847
Your auntie Pinkie Pie's
got it all taken care of.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.911
I'm a year older than you.

14:43.069 --> 14:44.169
GILDA!

14:44.172 --> 14:47.359
I'm so honored, to throw you
my signature Pinkie Pie party!

14:47.521 --> 14:52.003
And I really, truly, sincerely hope you
feel welcome here among all of us ponyfolk.

15:01.424 --> 15:06.572
Oh, Pinkie Pie! The old hoofshake buzzer!
You are a scream!

15:06.628 --> 15:09.798
Yeah... Good one, Pinkie Pie!

15:09.978 --> 15:12.558
Come on, G. I'll introduce you
to some of my other friends.

15:12.701 --> 15:14.132
Right behind you, Dash!

15:14.165 --> 15:16.526
I know what you're up to.

15:16.639 --> 15:17.759
Great!

15:19.276 --> 15:20.853
I know what you're planning.

15:21.972 --> 15:25.315
Well, I hope so! This wasn't
supposed to be a surprise party.

15:25.541 --> 15:29.559
I mean, I've got my eye on you.

15:29.609 --> 15:32.493
And I got my eye on you!

15:33.006 --> 15:37.413
Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda,
a long time dear friend of Rainbow Dash.

15:37.513 --> 15:39.789
Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.

15:44.330 --> 15:45.971
Please, help yourself.

15:46.426 --> 15:49.631
Banana lemon drops. Don't mind if I do.

15:55.806 --> 15:56.926
HOT!

15:56.956 --> 15:58.356
G.! The punch!

16:03.206 --> 16:04.379
Well, whaddya know?

16:04.544 --> 16:07.879
Pepper in the vanilla lemon drop and
the punch served in a dribble glass!

16:07.897 --> 16:10.696
HA! Priceless! Priceless!

16:15.045 --> 16:16.760
Yeah! Hilarious!

16:17.209 --> 16:19.436
Hey, G.! Look! Presents!

16:27.054 --> 16:31.429
Spittin' snakes. Somepony pulled
that prank on me last month.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.800
Ha ha. I bet I know who THAT was.

16:35.282 --> 16:36.402
You do?

16:42.477 --> 16:44.052
Cake time, everypony!

16:44.397 --> 16:46.130
Hey! Can I blow the candles?

16:46.229 --> 16:50.398
Why don't we let Gilda blow the candles, Spike?
She is a guest of honor after all.

16:51.591 --> 16:52.991
Exactly!

17:10.927 --> 17:14.429
Relighting birthday candles,
I love that prank! What a classic!

17:14.654 --> 17:16.809
Now I wonder who could have done that.

17:16.850 --> 17:19.078
Yeah, I wonder.

17:20.597 --> 17:23.933
Who cares? This cake is amazing!

17:24.185 --> 17:27.081
-Spike!
-What? It's great. Try some.

17:27.865 --> 17:30.982
Hey, G.! You're not upset about
some silly candles, are you?

17:31.196 --> 17:35.380
No way, Dash! Like I said,
I'm down with a good prank.

17:35.462 --> 17:37.308
Come on then. Let's have some cake.

17:40.426 --> 17:43.520
Hey! I'm watching you! Like a hawk.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.543
Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?

17:45.735 --> 17:48.241
Hey y'all! It's Pin the Tail on the Pony!

17:48.537 --> 17:49.424
Let's play!

17:49.425 --> 17:53.552
Oh, my favorite game! Can I go first?
Can I have the purple tail?

17:54.553 --> 17:57.907
Well, I am the guest of honor.
And I'll have the purple tail.

17:58.103 --> 18:00.462
Yeah! Gilda should definitely go first!

18:00.463 --> 18:01.757
Let's get you blindfolded.

18:01.758 --> 18:03.500
Hey...! Wha... What are you doing?!

18:04.878 --> 18:08.103
We're spinning you around and around and
then you can pin the tail on the pony.

18:08.437 --> 18:10.514
Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail!

18:10.515 --> 18:12.907
"Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail."

18:13.044 --> 18:16.100
Huh. Yeah, right.
This is another prank, isn't it?

18:16.141 --> 18:17.729
I'm going this way.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.575
Wait! The poster is this...

18:25.464 --> 18:28.341
Uh... Gilda? You pinned the tail
on the wrong end.

18:33.906 --> 18:36.508
This is your idea of a good time?!

18:36.669 --> 18:39.486
I've never a lamer bunch
of dweebs in all my life!

18:39.487 --> 18:41.716
And Pinkie Pie, you!

18:41.898 --> 18:45.050
You are Queen Lame-o
with your weak little party pranks.

18:45.150 --> 18:47.954
Did you really think you can
make me lose my cool?

18:48.128 --> 18:53.026
Well, Dash and I have ten times as much
cool as the rest of you put together!

18:53.141 --> 18:56.629
Come on, Dash!
We're bailing on this pathetic scene.

18:57.328 --> 19:01.286
Come on, Rainbow Dash!
I said: we're leaving!

19:02.020 --> 19:06.397
You know, Gilda? I was the one who set up
all those "weak pranks" at this party.

19:07.539 --> 19:08.659
What?!

19:10.196 --> 19:12.525
So I guess, *I'm* Queen Lame-o.

19:12.605 --> 19:14.969
Come on, Dash! You're joshing me!

19:14.994 --> 19:17.315
They weren't all meant for you specifically.

19:17.464 --> 19:19.538
It was just dumb luck that you set them all off.

19:19.619 --> 19:20.916
I should have known!

19:20.917 --> 19:23.545
That dribbled cup had
Rainbow Dash written all over it.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.749
No way. It was Pinkie Pie!

19:26.752 --> 19:30.130
She set up this party to trick me up.
To make a fool of me!

19:30.605 --> 19:33.456
Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude.

19:33.523 --> 19:36.331
I thought a good party might
turn that frown upside down.

19:36.567 --> 19:39.439
And you sure didn't need
any help making fool of yourself.

19:39.839 --> 19:43.511
You know, this is not how I thought my
old friend would treat my new friends.

19:43.793 --> 19:45.932
If being cool all you care about...

19:46.190 --> 19:49.849
...maybe you should go find some
new cool friends someplace else.

19:51.532 --> 19:54.595
Yeah? Well, you... you...

19:54.730 --> 19:57.345
You are such a... a flip-flop!

19:57.527 --> 19:59.821
Cool one minute and lame the next.

19:59.876 --> 20:03.265
When you decide not to be
lame anymore, give me a call.

20:04.872 --> 20:06.534
Not cool.

20:06.740 --> 20:09.225
Wow. Talk about a party pooper.

20:13.664 --> 20:16.293
I'm sorry, everypony, for bringing Gilda here.

20:16.435 --> 20:18.398
I didn't know how rude she was.

20:18.399 --> 20:23.208
And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined
that awesome party you put on for her.

20:23.258 --> 20:26.570
Hey! If you wanna hang out with party
poopers, that's your business.

20:26.582 --> 20:28.231
I'd rather hang out with you.

20:28.232 --> 20:31.042
-No hard feelings?
-No hard feelings.

20:37.225 --> 20:40.398
Hey, Pinkie. Sorry I accused you
of misjudging Gilda.

20:40.459 --> 20:42.616
Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you.

20:42.914 --> 20:47.286
It's okay, Twilight. Even you can't be
a super smart smarty smartpants all the time.

20:47.445 --> 20:51.254
Come on, everypony! There's still
a whole lot of party to finish!

20:53.668 --> 20:55.340
"Dearest Princess Celestia..."

20:55.571 --> 20:58.541
"Today I learned that it's hard
to accept when somepony you like..."

20:58.542 --> 21:01.313
"...wants to spend time with
somepony, who's not so nice."

21:01.754 --> 21:04.605
"Though it's impossible to control
who your friends hang out with..."

21:04.615 --> 21:07.324
"...it is possible to control your own behavior."

21:07.485 --> 21:09.479
"Just continue to be a good friend."

21:09.755 --> 21:14.408
"In the end the difference between a false friend
and one who is true will surely come to light."

21:14.559 --> 21:17.097
"Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

21:18.094 --> 21:21.680
"Dear Twilight Sparkle,
my most faithful student..."

21:24.783 --> 21:27.054
Oh! Wrong ink.

21:30.309 --> 21:33.809
