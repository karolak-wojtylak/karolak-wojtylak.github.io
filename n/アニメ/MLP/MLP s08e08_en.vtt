WEBVTT

00:34.068 --> 00:37.069
Ahem. Morning, Sunburst.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.171
What? Oh. Hi!

00:39.273 --> 00:39.985
Heh heh.

00:40.386 --> 00:42.398
You know, no matter how
many times I read it,

00:42.499 --> 00:45.411
Houyhnhnm's Guide to Magical
Arcana never gets boring.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.013
If you say so.

00:48.115 --> 00:52.151
I've got another letter
for you from Sires Hollow.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.852
Mm-hmm. Sure thing.

01:08.435 --> 01:09.401
What's this?

01:11.438 --> 01:12.572
Could I be experiencing the

01:12.673 --> 01:15.807
Cerebration Transmogrification
Effect described in Chapter 17?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.579
Oh, my cutie mark is glowing.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.349
My cutie mark is glowing!

01:23.651 --> 01:25.150
I know what this means!

01:26.320 --> 01:27.686
Why am I yelling!?

02:08.696 --> 02:11.263
Princess Twilight,
what an honor this is.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.265
I mean, it is, right?

02:13.767 --> 02:15.767
I'm called for a
friendship mission?

02:19.206 --> 02:20.218
You sure are.

02:20.319 --> 02:21.831
And it must be
a special one.

02:22.032 --> 02:25.144
Nopony outside of Ponyville
has ever been called before.

02:26.046 --> 02:27.746
If you need some
pointers, let me know.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.848
I've been on my fair
share of missions.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.218
You've been on
one, Spike.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.687
And that's.. my
fair share.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.576
Starlight!

02:40.777 --> 02:42.193
You mean we've
both been called?

02:42.296 --> 02:43.295
This is great!

02:43.997 --> 02:45.864
[unexcited]
Yeah. Great.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.533
Aren't you excited?

02:48.635 --> 02:50.335
You and me!
On a mission!

02:50.437 --> 02:51.470
Together.

02:52.974 --> 02:56.375
I-I'm sorry, are you not excited
to go on a mission with me?

02:56.477 --> 02:57.476
No...

02:58.078 --> 02:59.745
No! I mean, yes. Heh.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.713
Totally excited about
us going together,

03:01.815 --> 03:04.617
just not so excited
about where.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.421
Sires Hollow?

03:09.723 --> 03:11.490
Yep. Home.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.525
Oh. Great.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.998
You know, I can go if
you two don't want to.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.933
I am kind of an expert.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.349
It's not that I don't
want to go home,

03:37.451 --> 03:41.887
it's just that whenever I do,
my dad treats me like a filly,

03:42.189 --> 03:45.023
like nothing's changed
since I was a foal.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.024
Huh.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.059
I know. I'm a horrible
daughter.

03:48.895 --> 03:49.929
No, no.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.264
My mom actually does
kind of the same thing.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.083
Really?

03:54.284 --> 03:55.867
I don't even have to go home.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.536
She sends me
letters constantly

03:57.638 --> 03:59.571
asking about my plans
for the future.

03:59.673 --> 04:03.008
<i>"You're a grown-up pony,</i>
<i>Sunburst. You need a plan."</i>

04:04.544 --> 04:06.677
I haven't been home
in a while either.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.481
Hm. We'll just have to
explain to our parents

04:09.583 --> 04:11.350
that we're on an important
friendship mission,

04:11.452 --> 04:12.884
so they can't bother us.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.353
Do you think
that will work?

04:14.655 --> 04:15.354
Nope!

04:25.332 --> 04:27.766
[sigh] The great
thing about home is

04:27.868 --> 04:30.035
it always stays
just how you left--

04:30.137 --> 04:30.970
[bang] OH!

04:35.242 --> 04:36.708
Where did that come from?

04:38.345 --> 04:40.011
[woman's voice over speaker]
Welcome to Sires Hollow.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.517
Essence?

04:46.487 --> 04:47.886
Essence of what?

04:48.088 --> 04:49.221
You tell me.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.092
What is it?

04:53.294 --> 04:55.827
Ah. Chocolate? Maybe?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.729
Not chocolate maybe.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.498
Chocolate definitely.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.868
And all of the benefits
with none of the drawbacks.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.872
Didn't this used to
be a fruit stand?

05:07.074 --> 05:09.107
I don't know what
it used to be.

05:09.209 --> 05:12.444
The Sires Hollow Development
Committee determined what it is.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.347
The Sires Hollow
Development what?

05:15.549 --> 05:17.082
Where do ponies buy fruit?

05:17.184 --> 05:20.118
You can get a fruit
smoothie two doors down.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.656
All the shops are different.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.091
Everything's changed!

05:27.628 --> 05:28.794
Not everything.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.862
That's the same as it ever was.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.275
Sorry, our bookstore's
been declared a

05:43.377 --> 05:45.777
"site of historical
significance"

05:45.879 --> 05:49.114
by the Sires Hollow
Preservation Society.

05:49.616 --> 05:52.617
You'll have to experience
the books from here.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.688
That's why windows
are see-through.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.324
WHAT?

05:59.726 --> 06:01.460
Preservation Society?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.094
What is happening around here?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.330
I'll explain it to
you, Sugar-Plum.

06:07.833 --> 06:11.269
You are just as
cutsie-wootsie as ever!

06:11.471 --> 06:12.471
Dad!

06:12.973 --> 06:13.972
Quit it!

06:14.074 --> 06:15.275
What is going on?

06:15.576 --> 06:19.277
Oh! Just a father wanting to
preserve our town's rich history

06:19.379 --> 06:21.646
for his little
Pumpkie-Wumpkin.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.683
Dad. You promised no
pumpkie-wumpkins in public.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.653
[whispers]
Sorry, Chipmunk Cheeks.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.691
Er. Don't.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.259
You're preserving
the whole town?

06:34.461 --> 06:35.311
That's crazy.

06:35.512 --> 06:37.262
That's exactly
what I told him.

06:38.264 --> 06:40.932
I said, "Firelight,
you're crazy."

06:41.969 --> 06:42.886
Mom?

06:42.987 --> 06:45.704
Our village needs the
same thing you do, Sunburst:

06:45.806 --> 06:47.672
a clear plan
for the future.

06:48.942 --> 06:52.010
That's why I started the Sires
Hollow Development Committee.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.613
And I've got plans
for this little town.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.281
Big plans.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.834
Listen here, Stellar Flare; I'm
not going to let you

07:01.922 --> 07:04.856
turn our historical heritage
into Las Pegasus!

07:06.660 --> 07:09.628
And I'm not going to let
you turn it into a museum!

07:10.764 --> 07:11.431
Wait.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.799
Are you two fighting over this?

07:14.201 --> 07:16.434
Like, having a
friendship problem?

07:16.536 --> 07:18.703
Oh, there's no problem.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.606
Because there is
no friendship.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.810
Well, the good news is
we know why we're here.

07:34.705 --> 07:37.122
Maybe we should have
sent Spike after all.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.766
Sunburst and I were
called here to do a job

07:47.968 --> 07:50.368
and it looks like
you two are it.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.606
You mean your success
depends on us?

07:55.208 --> 07:56.125
Uh...

07:56.226 --> 07:58.743
And you have to hang out with
us the whole time you're here?

07:59.245 --> 08:00.347
Um...

08:02.349 --> 08:04.549
Well, I'll hear what
you have to say,

08:04.651 --> 08:06.251
but every plan I've
made for this town

08:06.353 --> 08:07.819
is perfectly reasonable.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.854
Good luck convincing me
my preservation efforts

08:09.956 --> 08:10.855
don't make sense.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.363
[voiceover]
Welcome to Sires Hollow.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.337
So we can't hold the books?

08:25.872 --> 08:28.239
Ha ha ha ha ha ha. No.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.643
Can<i> you </i> hold the books?

08:32.646 --> 08:33.378
No.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.848
So nopony can
read the books?

08:37.351 --> 08:40.285
[chuckle] Isn't she adorable?

08:45.425 --> 08:47.292
[voiceover]
Welcome to Sires Hollow.

08:51.798 --> 08:57.969
You can call them... smells,
but I call them essence!

09:03.109 --> 09:03.809
Fruity.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.445
Too bad there's nowhere
to get actual fruit.

09:07.647 --> 09:11.082
In the future, all ponies
will drink their fruit.

09:16.306 --> 09:19.023
One hundred percent
ancient pony grains.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.359
Just like the town
founders ate.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.162
Hope you like crust!

09:30.070 --> 09:32.069
[squeak]
Welcome to Sires Hollow.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.388
Welcome to Sires Hollow.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.590
Welcome to Sires Hollow.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.942
Welcome to Sires Hollow.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.229
Welcome to Sires--

09:40.330 --> 09:41.747
OK, it's annoying. I get it.

09:45.285 --> 09:49.087
Maybe my preservation efforts
were a little over the top.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.056
Oh...
Oh no.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.359
And I might have been
trying to turn the town

09:54.461 --> 09:55.794
into a shopping mall.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.030
Well, whatever direction
the town takes, from now on

09:59.132 --> 10:01.132
how about we work
together on it?

10:01.434 --> 10:02.268
Deal!

10:03.470 --> 10:06.337
Sunburst, you should
move closer to Ponyville.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.207
After this success, I'm sure
the Princess of Friendship

10:09.309 --> 10:11.009
will want to send you
on more missions.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.779
That's not really
how it works.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.548
Oh, look at the time!

10:16.650 --> 10:18.283
We should get going,
now that we've solved

10:18.385 --> 10:21.019
the friendship problem!
Right, Starlight?

10:21.321 --> 10:24.823
Yeah. The thing is, I don't
think we did solve it.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.391
When we solve a
friendship problem,

10:26.493 --> 10:28.493
our cutie marks are
supposed to glow.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.196
Aww, don't be
disappointed, Puddin'.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.865
Your papa will work
this out for ya.

10:34.435 --> 10:39.638
[sigh] My papa wasn't called by the
map in Twilight's castle; I was.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.545
How are you going to explain
this to the princess?

10:46.647 --> 10:49.414
What's your plan if she fires
you from friendship quests?

10:50.283 --> 10:50.927
Mom!

10:51.028 --> 10:51.872
She doesn't...

10:51.973 --> 10:52.917
It's not...

10:53.019 --> 10:55.053
Use your words, Sunburst.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.556
I guess you two
weren't the problem

10:58.658 --> 11:00.525
we were sent to
solve, after all.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.395
So now you don't even
know why you're here?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.698
We have to figure this out
before we run out of time!

11:06.800 --> 11:10.201
[sigh] Mom. There
isn't a time limit.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.904
So you're here for
an extra-long visit?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.273
You can stay in your
old room, Punkie-Wunk.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.109
It's just like you left it!

11:23.015 --> 11:25.717
[softly] We need to find this
friendship problem... now!

11:26.419 --> 11:29.187
Now, I know you have
your little job to do,

11:29.289 --> 11:32.690
but Stellar and I know the
town a lot better than you two.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.009
That's right.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.427
Neither of you have
been home in ages.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.563
You're going to need
our help to succeed.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.501
I guess that
makes sense...

11:44.053 --> 11:45.536
I already have
some ideas.

11:46.039 --> 11:46.771
Me too!

11:48.473 --> 11:50.608
I think I liked it better
when they were fighting.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.282
OK.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.218
Now that I've explained how
Sires Hollow was founded,

12:00.420 --> 12:03.721
we can start to explore all the
possible friendship problems

12:03.823 --> 12:06.190
that might have
developed over time.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.695
I appreciate the
history lesson, Dad,

12:10.897 --> 12:13.231
but I need to find
the problem now...

12:13.533 --> 12:14.365
in the present.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.502
Aw, now Hon-Bun, how
are you gonna do that

12:17.604 --> 12:20.004
without all the
backstory, huh?

12:21.741 --> 12:24.309
Oh, of course I know
how hard it is for you

12:24.411 --> 12:27.111
to sit still and focus, so...

12:27.213 --> 12:30.715
Would it help you pay attention
to hold on to your bwankie?

12:37.323 --> 12:39.224
Now you've had a little
setback, but don't worry.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.259
I know exactly what
you need to do.

12:41.661 --> 12:42.593
Make a plan?

12:42.695 --> 12:44.096
Already got one.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.098
Step one: interview
the suspects.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.068
Step two: use your talents
to solve the issue.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.370
Step three: get the
Princess of Friendship

12:52.472 --> 12:54.339
to send you on
more missions!

12:55.508 --> 12:58.743
Mom! IT DOES NOT
WORK LIKE THAT.

12:58.845 --> 12:59.744
Uh-huh!

13:04.717 --> 13:05.850
AHEM.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.189
[acting]
Oh, thank goodness you are here.

13:11.291 --> 13:15.126
These two ponies refuse
to use my essences.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.131
Maybe because we don't like
to cover our natural scent.

13:20.867 --> 13:21.900
AHEM!

13:27.508 --> 13:31.776
And <i>she</i> refuses
to buy our books.

13:32.779 --> 13:36.180
[all together]
Surely this is a
friendship problem.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.386
It needs to be a real
friendship problem!

13:41.488 --> 13:42.954
You can't just make one up!

13:43.056 --> 13:43.988
URGH!

13:45.792 --> 13:48.226
This is what happens
when we don't rehearse!

13:48.328 --> 13:49.127
UGH.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.031
Starlight?

13:53.233 --> 13:54.299
Sweetie?

13:55.201 --> 13:59.069
I found a really old town
bylaw that nopony agrees on.

13:59.671 --> 14:01.506
Apparently, we're not
supposed to prance

14:01.608 --> 14:03.074
or canter after dinnertime.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.710
Could that be the problem?
Sillyfilly?

14:07.980 --> 14:08.980
Phew.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.683
What are you doing?

14:11.785 --> 14:13.785
[sigh] Hiding from my mother.

14:13.887 --> 14:16.921
She started making up friendship
problems for me to solve.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.124
Oh.. My dad won't even let
me talk to anypony,

14:20.326 --> 14:24.129
in case they're "strangers."
I'm A GROWN MARE!

14:25.615 --> 14:27.498
We're never going to find
the friendship problem

14:27.600 --> 14:30.335
with them around,
let alone solve it.

14:31.137 --> 14:34.605
Maybe you two should start
looking for it on your own?

14:41.714 --> 14:45.515
OK, so we wanted to talk to all
of you, you know, in private.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.752
Just to see if there were
issues any of you had

14:47.854 --> 14:48.787
with your friends.

14:49.689 --> 14:50.288
Got it.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.390
Just one question.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.258
Why are we whispering?

14:56.763 --> 14:58.529
They're avoiding their parents.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.764
Ohhh!

15:01.868 --> 15:03.334
No. Not avoiding.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.103
Just.. taking a break.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.039
Yeah...

15:06.240 --> 15:09.874
We needed to focus, but we're
definitely not avoiding them.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.145
So you're whispering
with all of us

15:14.247 --> 15:15.947
in the darkest corner
of the shop,

15:16.049 --> 15:18.016
where nopony can
possibly see

15:18.118 --> 15:20.284
because you're
<i>not</i> avoiding them?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.187
Mm-hmm!

15:22.589 --> 15:24.956
Er.. but they definitely can't
hear us in here, right?

15:25.358 --> 15:26.291
No way!

15:26.392 --> 15:28.125
This is the
antiquities section.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.495
Nopony ever comes
back here.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.931
Firelight: There you are!

15:34.034 --> 15:35.666
But what are you doing in here?

15:35.868 --> 15:38.336
[gasp] Is the
friendship problem

15:38.438 --> 15:40.771
in my favorite section
of the book store?

15:45.345 --> 15:47.612
...and then I
thought the best way

15:47.714 --> 15:50.114
to look for a friendship
problem in the present...

15:50.416 --> 15:51.167
Dad!

15:51.268 --> 15:55.319
...was to look back in our
town history even farther!

15:57.090 --> 15:58.156
Stellar Flare: Sunburst!

15:58.558 --> 15:59.825
Oh. Finally.

16:00.026 --> 16:03.193
Now, I know you don't want
me to "make up" a problem,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.063
but what if I START one?

16:06.032 --> 16:07.399
That's not how this...

16:07.500 --> 16:10.067
I mean, no pony ever became
a success by following

16:10.170 --> 16:11.736
all the rules, right?

16:12.438 --> 16:13.637
How are things
on your end?

16:13.940 --> 16:15.139
Couldn't be better.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.807
New leads and such!

16:17.109 --> 16:17.977
Guys?

16:18.178 --> 16:21.346
We really are providing
excellent assistance, aren't we?

16:21.548 --> 16:22.332
Guys!

16:22.533 --> 16:26.217
I dare say our children should
be grateful for our help.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.485
GUYS!

16:28.087 --> 16:30.321
Both: We don't WANT your HELP!

16:38.999 --> 16:42.033
I'm sorry, you
don't want our help?

16:42.135 --> 16:44.635
[laugh] That's--that's
ridiculous.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.772
What reason could you
possibly have for that?

16:47.874 --> 16:50.442
BECAUSE YOU'RE DRIVING US CRAZY!

16:51.544 --> 16:52.577
Oh, really?

16:52.679 --> 16:55.046
And just how am I
driving you crazy?

16:55.748 --> 16:57.882
By always coming up with plans!

16:58.084 --> 17:00.051
I don't need a plan!

17:00.153 --> 17:04.756
I mean, maybe I do, but
it'll be mine, not yours!

17:05.758 --> 17:09.260
Well, I'm sorry
for trying to help!

17:12.398 --> 17:14.098
And you're not any better.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.167
I'm not a filly.

17:16.269 --> 17:20.571
I'm a grown pony with a job to
do and I'll do it on my own.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.742
Well, I'll let you
get to it, then.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.614
Great...

17:28.715 --> 17:30.849
Now we have to smooth things
over with our parents

17:30.950 --> 17:33.784
on top of finding and solving
a friendship problem.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.255
It's almost like our
relationship with our parents

17:37.357 --> 17:38.957
is the friendship problem.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.025
You don't think
that's it, do you?

17:41.227 --> 17:42.227
Ahem.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.062
That's what all
of us think.

17:45.197 --> 17:46.464
Agh!

17:48.051 --> 17:51.935
Why couldn't we have been sent
to stop a war or something?

17:58.244 --> 17:59.044
Dad?

17:59.846 --> 18:02.146
Hello, Ms. Glimmer.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.148
How is your friendship
problem search going?

18:04.250 --> 18:06.350
I only ask as an
interested observer,

18:06.452 --> 18:08.486
since I know you are an
adult who's capable

18:08.588 --> 18:11.522
of doing things without
help from anypony else.

18:12.659 --> 18:17.262
Actually, I think Sunburst
and I figured out what it is.

18:18.064 --> 18:21.632
So, Stellar and I weren't
really helpful after all.

18:22.234 --> 18:24.835
Well, we haven't
actually solved it.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.637
And I don't think we can.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.272
Not without you.

18:36.983 --> 18:37.917
Pungent!

18:39.319 --> 18:42.153
Oh, did you come by
to be driven crazy

18:42.255 --> 18:44.589
by more of your mother's plans?

18:45.191 --> 18:47.125
No, I came to apologize.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.895
Well, it's going to take
more than an apology

18:50.997 --> 18:53.397
to make up for telling me
you don't want my help

18:53.499 --> 18:55.266
finding your friendship problem.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.235
Oh, I'm not sorry for that.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.303
Starlight and I already figured
out what the problem is.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.772
This is a terrible apology.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.543
Well, if you come with
me and help fix it,

19:05.745 --> 19:07.011
I'll give you a better one.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.583
Usually, Twilight or one of
our other friends gets called

19:12.685 --> 19:15.519
to a place with a
friendship problem to fix.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.722
But Starlight and I
realized we came here

19:17.824 --> 19:20.591
to fix a friendship
problem we already had.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.661
I'm sorry I've been
avoiding coming home, Dad,

19:23.763 --> 19:26.565
but you can't keep
treating me like a foal.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.300
I'm sorry, Sugarbun!

19:31.971 --> 19:35.273
I just know how hard things
were for you when you left home.

19:35.475 --> 19:40.245
I guess I wanted you to feel
safe, like when you were young.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.780
Dad, I know I've
made some mistakes,

19:42.882 --> 19:44.715
and I'll probably
make a bunch more,

19:45.017 --> 19:46.551
but I learn from them.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.786
I think that's
what growing up is.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.558
I'm sorry I never told you how
much your plans bothered me,

19:54.660 --> 19:56.561
and I know you just
want me to succeed,

19:57.163 --> 19:58.863
but I need to do
that on my own.

19:59.465 --> 20:00.998
I remember how
lost you were

20:01.100 --> 20:03.534
when you flunked out
of magic school.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.003
I thought as long
as you had a plan,

20:06.105 --> 20:07.639
you'd never feel
that way again.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.774
You don't have to worry, Mom.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.609
I need to find my own way,

20:11.711 --> 20:14.245
but I definitely don't
feel lost anymore.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.860
It's so beautiful!

20:30.997 --> 20:34.665
The glowing cutie mark is such
a symbol of accomplishment.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.534
I don't suppose
there's a way for you

20:36.636 --> 20:38.469
to get it to glow all the time.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.906
Heh heh. Pretty sure it
doesn't work that way.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.008
Not unless we solved a
friendship problem every few

20:44.110 --> 20:48.246
seconds, and I kinda hope this
one will be it for a while.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.916
You know, it seems to me your
map is saying we're not just

20:52.018 --> 20:55.754
your parents; we're
your friends too.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.689
I guess so.

20:58.191 --> 21:01.425
So, if I promise to treat you
less like a little filly

21:01.527 --> 21:04.228
and more like a friend,
will you visit more?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.397
Absolutely.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.369
And if you start to
drive me crazy again,

21:11.471 --> 21:13.871
I'll tell you instead
of never coming home.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.041
That's lovely of you to
say, dear, but you know,

21:17.143 --> 21:18.777
I can always visit you.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.211
Stellar, you're a genius!

21:21.313 --> 21:22.347
Ha ha ha!

21:22.448 --> 21:24.282
How do you feel
about a road trip?

21:24.584 --> 21:26.918
I might have a few
plans for that.
