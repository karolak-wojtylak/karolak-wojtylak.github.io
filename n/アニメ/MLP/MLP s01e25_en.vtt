00:14.231 --> 00:15.497
Oh. Hi, Pinkie Pie.

00:15.595 --> 00:18.799
<i>This is your singing telegram
I hope it finds you well</i>

00:18.799 --> 00:21.771
<i>You're invited to a party
Cause we think you're really swell</i>

00:21.771 --> 00:24.677
<i>Gummy's turning one year old
So help us celebrate</i>

00:24.677 --> 00:27.836
<i>The cake will be delicious
The festivities first-rate</i>

00:28.426 --> 00:31.400
<i>There will be games and dancing
Bob for apples, cut a rug</i>

00:31.400 --> 00:34.389
<i>And when the party's over
We'll gather round for a group hug</i>

00:35.101 --> 00:38.842
<i>No need to bring a gift
Being there will be enough</i>

00:39.008 --> 00:42.800
<i>Birthdays mean having fun with friends
Not getting lots of stuff</i>

00:43.332 --> 00:48.171
<i>It won't be the same without you
So we hope that you say yes</i>

00:48.171 --> 00:52.636
<i>So please, oh please, R.S.V.P.
And come and be our guest</i>

00:56.681 --> 01:00.503
Next time I think I'll just
pass out written invitations.

01:48.818 --> 01:51.639
Nice one. Now let me show you
how it's really done.

01:52.290 --> 01:53.119
Hey, girls!

01:53.572 --> 01:54.565
Hey, Pinkie Pie.

01:54.904 --> 01:55.680
Howdy!

01:55.950 --> 01:59.161
Just wanted to tell you how happy I am
that you could make it to Gummy's party.

01:59.295 --> 02:01.746
Are you kiddin'? I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

02:02.143 --> 02:03.104
Me neither.

02:03.104 --> 02:06.149
When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there!

02:08.656 --> 02:09.966
TADA!

02:10.198 --> 02:12.038
Ah, it's just a boring old apple.

02:12.038 --> 02:14.528
Don't worry. There're plenty of other surprises in there.

02:14.958 --> 02:16.322
What kind of surprises?

02:16.398 --> 02:19.565
I can't tell you that, silly.
Then it wouldn't be a surprise!

02:34.418 --> 02:36.792
This punch is simply divine.

02:36.792 --> 02:40.304
Is this the same recipe you used
for your "Spring has Sprung" party?

02:40.400 --> 02:41.695
No, something new.

02:46.595 --> 02:48.222
It's Gummy's favorite!

02:53.852 --> 02:56.084
Ooh! This is my jam!

03:00.335 --> 03:01.162
Having fun?

03:01.228 --> 03:02.525
A blast!

03:02.525 --> 03:05.531
You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie.

03:05.631 --> 03:08.584
They're always the best parties,
cause my best friends are always there!

03:12.981 --> 03:14.578
Come on, everypony!

03:16.116 --> 03:18.460
Gummy wants to dance!

03:18.761 --> 03:22.399
Go Gummy! It's ya birthday!
Go Gummy! It's ya birthday!

03:27.838 --> 03:30.443
Hooie! I am beat.

03:30.473 --> 03:31.876
Haven't danced that much since...

03:31.876 --> 03:33.741
Well... since you last party.

03:33.841 --> 03:35.205
Thanks again for the invite!

03:35.205 --> 03:36.635
See you later, birthday alligator!

03:36.635 --> 03:39.310
Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soirÃ©e.

03:39.310 --> 03:40.592
It's been lovely.

03:41.726 --> 03:44.433
You sure you don't wanna stay?
There's still some cake left.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.019
Uh... I think I'm gonna pass.

03:47.585 --> 03:50.175
Great party, though.
We should do this again soon.

03:53.356 --> 03:55.502
We should do this again soon!

04:06.423 --> 04:07.517
Oh. Hi, Pinkie...

04:07.517 --> 04:08.436
It's soon!

04:08.702 --> 04:09.556
Pardon me?

04:09.648 --> 04:12.276
You said we should have
another party soon and... it's soon!

04:12.615 --> 04:14.176
Here is your invitation!

04:14.927 --> 04:17.772
"You're invited to Gummy's after-birthday party."

04:17.772 --> 04:19.739
"This afternoon at 3 o'clock."

04:19.860 --> 04:21.415
All our bestest friends are invited...

04:21.415 --> 04:24.555
...and here's gonna be dancing and games
and cake and ice cream and punch...

04:24.931 --> 04:26.359
This afternoon?

04:26.629 --> 04:29.216
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon?

04:29.571 --> 04:30.694
Yes, indeedy!

04:30.877 --> 04:32.180
Oh, gosh.

04:32.490 --> 04:36.053
I wish I could make it but I've
gotten a bit behind in my studies.

04:37.965 --> 04:39.631
I've really gotta hit the books.

04:40.933 --> 04:43.027
I understand. Your studies come first.

04:43.027 --> 04:46.154
But don't worry! We'll be sure
to save you some cake.

04:46.154 --> 04:47.141
Please do!

04:47.510 --> 04:50.117
Oh! And Twilight, you shouldn't hit the books.

04:50.117 --> 04:51.592
You should really just read them.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.099
I'll keep that in mind.

04:57.681 --> 04:58.971
Oh hi, Pinkie Pie.

04:59.071 --> 05:00.803
What brings you here round these parts?

05:01.003 --> 05:04.015
Who's ready to shake their hoof-thang?

05:05.312 --> 05:08.225
It's an invitation at Gummy's
after-birthday party this afternoon!

05:08.225 --> 05:10.942
There's gonna be dancing and games
and cake and ice cream and punch...

05:10.942 --> 05:12.313
This afternoon?

05:12.481 --> 05:14.574
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon?

05:14.843 --> 05:17.126
That's funny. That's just what Twilight said.

05:17.126 --> 05:19.909
And the answer is "Yes, it's this afternoon".

05:20.029 --> 05:22.427
Oh... Well, I... I, uh...

05:22.427 --> 05:24.265
I don't think I can make it, cause, uh...

05:24.265 --> 05:25.394
I have to, uh...

05:26.020 --> 05:28.141
Uh, you know... I, uh...

05:28.141 --> 05:28.985
Pick apples!

05:29.145 --> 05:31.470
Yep, apples, cause that's what we do.

05:31.470 --> 05:34.123
With, uh... apples. We, uh...

05:35.030 --> 05:35.779
Pick 'em.

05:44.930 --> 05:46.065
Okie dokie lokie!

05:46.065 --> 05:49.239
A party is still a party,
even if there're only three guests.

05:56.602 --> 05:59.577
Anything else I can do for you, most beautiful one?

06:00.936 --> 06:03.012
Mmm... Perhaps you could take a bath.

06:03.427 --> 06:04.902
How do I put this delicately...

06:05.307 --> 06:06.851
You smell like a rotten apple core...

06:06.851 --> 06:10.137
...that's been wrapped in moldy hay
and dipped in dragon perspiration.

06:17.041 --> 06:20.689
Ooh, love the new hat.
Very modern. What's the occasion?

06:20.935 --> 06:22.990
Gummy's after-birthday party is this afternoon.

06:22.990 --> 06:24.649
I'm delivering the invitations.

06:24.649 --> 06:26.911
The party is this afternoon?

06:26.911 --> 06:29.148
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon?

06:29.228 --> 06:31.770
It's so strange. Everypony keep saying that?

06:31.885 --> 06:33.434
Oh, do they?

06:33.607 --> 06:36.648
I know it's short notice, but we had
such a great time at this birthday party...

06:36.648 --> 06:39.445
...I thought we could have even
more fun at this after-birthday party.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.884
And I'm sure that we would,
but I'm going to have to decline.

06:42.984 --> 06:44.780
I have to... wash my hair.

06:45.115 --> 06:47.437
Don't be silly. Your hair doesn't look dirty.

06:47.537 --> 06:48.639
-It doesn't?
-Nope.

06:53.445 --> 06:55.497
See? Dirty.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.000
I have to go.

06:58.377 --> 07:01.984
Huh. No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity.

07:02.687 --> 07:06.161
Oh well. A party is still a party,
even with only two guests.

07:07.387 --> 07:08.722
This afternoon?

07:08.822 --> 07:10.140
-As in...
-Yes!

07:10.271 --> 07:12.263
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon.

07:12.563 --> 07:14.779
Oh man, we'd love to, but...

07:14.779 --> 07:17.126
...we're... house-sitting this afternoon.

07:17.286 --> 07:18.887
Huh... Both of you?

07:19.220 --> 07:21.294
It's a... a big house.

07:22.796 --> 07:25.304
Uh, look at the time!
We'd really better get going.

07:26.804 --> 07:27.553
Wait!

07:27.823 --> 07:30.260
Maybe I could bring you some
after-birthday cake and ice cream?

07:30.460 --> 07:31.951
Who you house-sitting for?

07:32.051 --> 07:32.743
Harry.

07:32.843 --> 07:33.475
Harry?

07:33.475 --> 07:34.952
Yeah, I don't think you known him.

07:35.052 --> 07:37.815
That's strange. I know just about
everypony around here.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.476
He's... a bear.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.341
A bear?

07:41.788 --> 07:43.352
Yep! He's a bear, all right.

07:43.352 --> 07:46.400
And he'll be pretty upset if we don't
get over to his house soon, heh.

07:47.875 --> 07:48.557
Wait!

07:49.037 --> 07:51.344
There's a bear around here who lives in a house?

07:51.677 --> 07:53.910
It's... really more of a cave.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.796
But he sticks the place up
so much it feels like a house.

07:57.422 --> 08:00.855
And, uh... he wants us to look after
his house, uh, cave while he's...

08:00.855 --> 08:01.920
At the beach!

08:01.920 --> 08:03.644
He's vacationing at the beach?

08:03.896 --> 08:05.548
Yep! He loves to...

08:07.370 --> 08:08.631
-Collect seashells.
-Play volleyball.

08:09.185 --> 08:10.382
-Play volleyball.
-Collect seashells.

08:10.809 --> 08:12.072
-Collect volleyball.
-Play seashells.

08:13.895 --> 08:14.936
Gotta go!

08:19.445 --> 08:22.592
Something strange is definitely
going on around here, Gummy.

08:22.692 --> 08:25.784
Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to
house-sit for that vacationing bear...

08:25.784 --> 08:29.373
...but what are the chances all my other friends
would have plans this afternoon too?

08:29.696 --> 08:33.310
Rarity has to wash her hair...
Applejack has to pick apples...

08:33.310 --> 08:36.225
Twilight is behind on her studies
and has to hit the books...

08:36.451 --> 08:40.514
The more I think about it, the more
those are starting to sound like...

08:41.120 --> 08:42.716
Excuses!

08:53.108 --> 08:54.776
That didn't look like studying.

08:55.111 --> 08:56.289
Or hitting.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.496
Oh! You must be here for...

09:04.496 --> 09:05.096
Shh!

09:06.328 --> 09:09.056
-Is Pinkie Pie around?
-Oh, I don't think so.

09:09.056 --> 09:12.090
Good.I don't want her
to know anything about this.

09:12.190 --> 09:14.839
Yes, of course. I'll be right back.

09:16.948 --> 09:18.667
But... we're friends.

09:18.867 --> 09:21.443
What wouldn't Twilight want me
to know anything about?

09:22.856 --> 09:23.871
She's coming back.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.195
There you go.

09:25.195 --> 09:28.345
Thanks. And remember, not a word to Pinkie Pie.

09:29.426 --> 09:31.357
Hey! What's with the tin can?

09:50.497 --> 09:53.270
Time to get to the bottom of things.

10:05.026 --> 10:06.363
I think our cover's been blown.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.333
I need a new disguise.

10:18.837 --> 10:21.147
She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she?

10:21.362 --> 10:22.531
I don't think so.

10:22.531 --> 10:25.409
Oh, good. I'd hate for her to ruin everything.

10:25.579 --> 10:26.480
Me too.

10:53.165 --> 10:55.291
-Have you seen her?
-Not since this morning.

10:55.291 --> 11:00.162
Me neither. Can you believe she was planning on
throwing an after-birthday party *today*?

11:00.388 --> 11:03.744
I'm just glad I was able to come up
with an excuse for why I couldn't be there.

11:03.844 --> 11:07.020
Me too. This obviously
going to be so much better.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.864
As long as we keep her from
finding out about it, it will.

11:12.370 --> 11:13.557
See you later!

11:27.972 --> 11:30.665
I thought everypony loved my parties.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.291
Hi, Pinkie Pie!

11:34.110 --> 11:34.856
Uh-oh.

11:35.813 --> 11:37.361
Rainbow Dash! Wait!

11:43.593 --> 11:44.693
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?!

11:53.897 --> 11:56.964
WHAT'S THE REAL REASON YOU DON'T
WANNA COME TO GUMMY'S PARTY?!

12:09.218 --> 12:10.957
WHAT'S IN THOSE BAGS?!

12:17.408 --> 12:19.187
Applejack! We have a problem!

12:26.508 --> 12:28.598
I know you're in there!

12:30.054 --> 12:31.831
Oh, uh... howdy partner!

12:32.067 --> 12:34.771
Mind if I... take a look inside the barn?

12:35.868 --> 12:38.648
No... I mean, yes... I mean,
you can't come in here.

12:38.848 --> 12:40.374
Rainbow Dash just went in there.

12:40.428 --> 12:43.331
Oh, well, she was just
bringin' in some... supplies.

12:43.431 --> 12:45.868
Yep, supplies for the... renovation.

12:45.868 --> 12:47.995
Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom.

12:48.198 --> 12:51.379
Uh... lotsa construction going on
in there right now!

12:51.483 --> 12:53.827
You heard her. Construction!

13:12.537 --> 13:16.248
Yup! Construction. That's my story
and I'm stickin' to it, heh.

13:28.210 --> 13:30.723
Okie dokie lokie.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.496
Secrets and lies. It's all secrets
and lies with those ponies.

13:44.496 --> 13:48.244
They're up to something, Gummy.
Something they don't want me to know about.

13:48.649 --> 13:50.698
Well, I'm gonna know about it.

13:50.698 --> 13:52.641
I'm gonna know about it big time!

13:52.641 --> 13:55.929
And I know just who's gonna
tell me all about it.

13:55.929 --> 13:58.063
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BIG TIME!

13:59.349 --> 14:01.736
Wow... Nice spread!

14:02.910 --> 14:04.690
It's all yours, Spike.

14:09.759 --> 14:11.674
All you have to do is talk.

14:13.199 --> 14:15.015
That's it? Oh, you got it.

14:15.015 --> 14:17.259
Okay... Uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh?

14:17.259 --> 14:19.344
I love sunny spring day, don't you?

14:19.344 --> 14:21.948
The birds chirping, the flowers blooming...

14:22.048 --> 14:22.900
No, no, no.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.603
Talk about our friends.

14:25.561 --> 14:26.528
Oh. Okay.

14:26.628 --> 14:29.510
Let's see. There's Twilight Sparkle,
she's a unicorn.

14:29.510 --> 14:31.452
Good with magic, real brainiac.

14:31.575 --> 14:34.140
And then we got Rarity. Total knockout!

14:34.140 --> 14:37.228
Twilight seems to think I don't have a chance
with her, but... eh, what does she know?

14:37.228 --> 14:40.086
Let's see, there's... there's Fluttershy,
a pegasus afraid of height.

14:40.086 --> 14:41.519
Huh, what's up with that?

14:41.768 --> 14:43.712
No! You're not understanding me!

14:43.712 --> 14:45.526
I want you to confess!

14:45.616 --> 14:46.607
Confess?

14:46.607 --> 14:47.874
CONFESS!

14:50.696 --> 14:54.593
I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's
copy of Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions!

14:55.596 --> 14:56.464
And?

14:57.007 --> 14:59.658
And I'm the one who used up
all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday...

14:59.658 --> 15:01.211
...when I took a seven-hour bubble bath.

15:01.845 --> 15:03.032
And?!

15:04.124 --> 15:06.484
And sometimes, when no one's around...

15:06.584 --> 15:07.463
...I do this.

15:08.678 --> 15:11.762
Looking good, Spike. Looking real good.

15:15.150 --> 15:17.648

15:18.424 --> 15:20.178

15:20.178 --> 15:22.138
Tell me what you want me to say and I'll say it!

15:22.138 --> 15:24.558
Tell me that my friends are all
lying to me and avoiding me...

15:24.558 --> 15:27.773
...because they don't like my parties and
THEY DON'T WANNA BE MY FRIENDS ANYMORE!!!

15:30.265 --> 15:31.882
Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you...

15:31.882 --> 15:34.378
...cause they don't like your parties and
they don't wanna be your friends anymore!

15:34.461 --> 15:36.859
AHA! I KNEW IT!

15:41.283 --> 15:42.042
Oh no.

15:42.423 --> 15:45.674
My friends don't like my parties and
they don't wanna be my friends anymore.

15:48.683 --> 15:50.826
Uh... So...

15:57.868 --> 15:59.673

16:51.408 --> 16:53.433

And I'm not gonna invite them

17:15.174 --> 17:17.436
The don't DESERVE to be invited to my party!

17:18.296 --> 17:20.317

17:30.552 --> 17:31.723
Hey there, Pinkie Pie.

17:32.023 --> 17:33.912
Sorry I was in such a rush earlier.

17:33.912 --> 17:36.237
Had some place to be and
couldn't slow down and say hello.

17:36.419 --> 17:37.575
You know how it goes.

17:37.842 --> 17:40.063
I know how it goes, all right.

17:40.456 --> 17:44.279
Yeah... So, why don't you come
with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?

17:44.429 --> 17:47.804
No thanks. I'm spending time with my real friends.

17:47.804 --> 17:49.700

17:49.700 --> 17:52.139

18:03.603 --> 18:05.315

18:05.415 --> 18:09.410
I most certainly am not.
I'm having a wonderful time right here.

18:09.982 --> 18:11.930
You should really just come with me.

18:11.930 --> 18:15.086

That's it. Party's over.

18:22.048 --> 18:22.928
Come on, Pinkie Pie.

18:23.028 --> 18:23.720
No!

18:23.720 --> 18:25.283
Pinkie Pie, let's go!

18:25.283 --> 18:26.569
I said no!

18:27.683 --> 18:31.838
You, ugh... have to... come with... me!

18:32.038 --> 18:34.825
No... I... don't!

18:40.266 --> 18:43.508
Oh, you want to do this the hard way?
We'll do this the hard way!

18:50.961 --> 18:52.843
We're... here...

18:54.894 --> 18:56.595
Surprise!

19:05.161 --> 19:07.634
I really thought she'd be more excited.

19:08.166 --> 19:10.518
Excited?! EXCITED?!

19:10.770 --> 19:13.957
Why would I be excited to attend
my own farewell party?!

19:14.336 --> 19:15.878
Farewell party?

19:15.978 --> 19:19.100
Yes! You don't like me anymore so you
decided to kick me out of the group...

19:19.100 --> 19:21.297
...and throw a great, big party to celebrate.

19:21.297 --> 19:23.372
A "Farewell of Pinkie Pie" party.

19:25.343 --> 19:28.674
Why in the world would you think
we didn't like you anymore, sugar cube?

19:28.774 --> 19:29.618
Why?

19:30.197 --> 19:31.166
Why?!

19:31.638 --> 19:32.760
WHY?!

19:33.629 --> 19:36.769
Because you've been LYING
to me and avoiding me all day!

19:36.869 --> 19:38.082
That's why!

19:39.077 --> 19:42.919
Uh, yeah. Because we wanted
your party to be a surprise.

19:43.722 --> 19:46.042
We've been planning this party
for such a long time...

19:46.042 --> 19:48.562
...we had to make excuses for why
we couldn't attend Gummy's party...

19:48.562 --> 19:50.609
...so that we could everything ready for yours.

19:50.854 --> 19:52.523
If this is a farewell party...

19:52.523 --> 19:55.349
...why does the cake I picked up
from Sugarcube Corner say...

19:55.349 --> 19:57.435
..."Happy birthday, Pinkie Pie"?

20:08.327 --> 20:10.629
Because it's my birthday!

20:10.629 --> 20:12.970
Oh, how could I have forgotten my own birthday?

20:16.601 --> 20:19.958
And you like me so much, you decided to
throw me a surprise party.

20:20.685 --> 20:22.928
That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling.

20:23.073 --> 20:25.634
You girls are the best friends ever!

20:27.018 --> 20:29.272
How could I have ever doubted you?

20:29.564 --> 20:31.119
It's okay, Pinkie Pie.

20:31.119 --> 20:32.988
It could have happened to any of us.

20:35.975 --> 20:39.167
I'm just glad I haven't been
replaced by a bucket of turnips.

20:39.229 --> 20:40.034
Huh?

20:40.054 --> 20:41.662
You don't wanna know.

20:41.795 --> 20:43.850
Alright, girls! Enough of this gabbin'.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.363
Let's party!

20:52.034 --> 20:54.148
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:54.232 --> 20:57.370
"I am writing to you
from the most delightful party."

20:57.370 --> 21:00.236
"I'm not only having
a great time with my friends..."

21:00.236 --> 21:04.489
"...but also was given the opportunity
to learn a valuable lesson about friendship."

21:04.890 --> 21:08.830
"Always expect the best from your friends
and never assume the worst."

21:08.952 --> 21:12.904
"Rest assured that a good friend always
has your best interests at heart."

21:13.181 --> 21:15.810
"You faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

21:15.906 --> 21:19.552
You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's
after-birthday party too, would you?

21:19.552 --> 21:22.294
His party was cut short and
he's pretty upset about it.

21:24.819 --> 21:27.033
Why not? Let's have a party for Gummy.

21:29.575 --> 21:33.075
