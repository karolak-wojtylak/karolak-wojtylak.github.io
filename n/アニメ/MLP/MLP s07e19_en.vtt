WEBVTT

00:10.877 --> 00:13.279
Hmph. Looks like I'm
not the only one

00:13.381 --> 00:16.048
who left Mare's Day
to the last minute.

00:17.850 --> 00:18.951
There's just so many!

00:19.153 --> 00:20.252
How can I choose?

00:25.259 --> 00:28.494
Now hang on, everypony.
We'll help all of you.

00:28.596 --> 00:29.495
HOW?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.798
Rarity: What I would do...

00:32.400 --> 00:35.567
... is pick flowers that
accentuate my mane.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.603
It makes for a
captivating color story

00:37.705 --> 00:39.872
when you present them to
whomever they're intended.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.245
That's it!

00:55.422 --> 00:58.223
Color consultations was
a great idea, Rarity.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.760
Now, what can we do for you?

01:01.062 --> 01:03.228
Oh, darling, I need a
dozen lavender pieces

01:03.330 --> 01:04.563
for Photo Finish's shoot

01:04.665 --> 01:06.665
on the Most Beautiful
Manes in Equestria.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.871
I know you're swamped,
but it's for Vanity Mare.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.206
She's going to take
pictures of my mane,

01:14.308 --> 01:16.275
so color coordination
is a must.

01:17.810 --> 01:19.645
Anything for you, Rarity.

01:23.950 --> 01:26.051
Have you a single big one?

01:26.253 --> 01:28.153
If the wind came
from one direction,

01:28.255 --> 01:30.690
it would really
intensify the effect.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.692
I don't. But I
could make you one.

01:33.894 --> 01:36.095
It's not like I've got
anything else to do.

01:40.366 --> 01:43.302
Hmm. I do enjoy the
wind-swept look,

01:43.404 --> 01:47.406
but other ponies might need to
see it before they feel it.

02:03.189 --> 02:06.425
My mane will be flowing over
the chaise in the tableau

02:06.527 --> 02:10.296
I have in mind, but I was
hoping to choose the color.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.966
Could you make one
in a pale yellow?

02:14.068 --> 02:17.236
I need something across
the color wheel from.. this. Heheh.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.571
Oooh. If these came
in different colors,

02:19.673 --> 02:21.841
I'd buy one for every room.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.377
Hmm. Sales have been down...

02:25.679 --> 02:27.279
More colors it is!

02:34.455 --> 02:35.254
Pinkie?

02:35.356 --> 02:37.723
I need to put Photo
Finish in a good mood.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.826
And nothing creates a better
mood than your confect--

02:41.228 --> 02:42.728
Am I interrupting?

02:43.030 --> 02:44.796
We were just celebrating
the anniversary

02:44.898 --> 02:46.932
of the twins' first sneezes!

02:50.003 --> 02:52.838
<i> ♪ Just about one year ago ♪</i>

02:52.940 --> 02:55.240
<i> ♪ There was a tickle in</i>
<i> your nose. ♪</i>

02:55.342 --> 03:01.613
<i> ♪ You snorted through the</i>
<i>nursery HAAAAAPY SneeziveSary! ♪</i>

03:01.815 --> 03:05.284
<i> ♪ Achoo! Achoo! Acccchhoo! ♪</i>

03:05.786 --> 03:07.287
Congratulations.

03:50.697 --> 03:55.400
Ah! Pinkie, I can't have Photo
Finish shoot my mane like this!

03:55.502 --> 03:57.936
And this party string
won't come off!

03:58.038 --> 04:00.472
Oh, that's because it's
not just party string;

04:00.574 --> 04:03.308
it's Super Sticky
Celebration String!

04:03.910 --> 04:04.708
Grrrr.

04:05.210 --> 04:09.414
Sorry. I guess my sneeziversary
was a little too sneezibratory.

04:12.151 --> 04:13.585
It'll be fine, Pinkie.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.555
I'll find a way to clean this
up before the shoot tomorrow.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.026
Actually, you might
consider doing the same.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.738
If only we had some kind of
super sudsy mane conditioning

04:32.840 --> 04:37.576
shampoo for you and a magical
cleaning remover potion for me.

04:39.211 --> 04:40.746
Oh! That's it!

04:40.948 --> 04:42.848
We'll pay
a visit to Zecora!

04:43.050 --> 04:44.916
She's a wonder with a cauldron.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.385
I'm sure she can mix
a fix for both of us.

04:47.687 --> 04:48.454
Huh?

04:49.156 --> 04:51.923
That's good because it would
take forever to yank all those

04:52.025 --> 04:55.026
baked goods out of this Super
Sticky Celebration String.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.799
I.. think you may still
have some baking to do.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.940
I do wish Zecora lived in town.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.509
One shouldn't have to brave the
darkest part of the forest

05:11.611 --> 05:12.711
for shampoo.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.811
Do you think
Photo Finish

05:13.913 --> 05:15.814
would want to take a
picture of my mane?

05:16.949 --> 05:20.051
Well.. mmm... I'm not sure that your
style is quite right

05:20.153 --> 05:21.787
for this particular photo essay.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.822
Photo Finish traveled
everywhere in her search

05:23.924 --> 05:25.824
for the most
beautiful of manes.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.561
Even Yakyakistan?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.663
Well, Yaks don't
have manes, per se

05:31.865 --> 05:34.432
and I'm not sure their style is
quite what she's looking for either.

05:36.869 --> 05:39.538
Though, at this moment,
neither is mine!

05:39.740 --> 05:41.072
Don't worry!

05:41.174 --> 05:43.575
Zecora will absotively
be able to help!

05:44.277 --> 05:45.745
I'm sure you're right.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.347
Listen, spooky eyes!

05:48.449 --> 05:50.714
Why don't you take a picture!?
It will last longer!

05:52.285 --> 05:53.418
On second thought, don't!

05:53.620 --> 05:55.120
Getting my picture
taken in this state

05:55.222 --> 05:57.222
is what I'm trying to avoid!

05:58.591 --> 06:00.926
Rarity: Are you certain that's safe?

06:01.828 --> 06:03.762
<i> Zecora: I'm sure</i>
<i> they seem strange,</i>

06:03.864 --> 06:05.297
<i> but my methods are mine.</i>

06:05.399 --> 06:08.867
<i> After all, I've been doing</i>
<i> this for quite a long time.</i>

06:12.738 --> 06:15.874
I'll have those cupcakes
cleaned off in no time!

06:15.976 --> 06:18.343
You really should bake new ones.

06:18.645 --> 06:19.411
Nah!

06:20.313 --> 06:23.348
<i> For your mane, of course,</i>
<i> just soap will do,</i>

06:23.450 --> 06:25.851
<i> so use my super sudsy shampoo.</i>

06:25.953 --> 06:27.753
Ohhh! What a relief!

06:27.855 --> 06:29.588
I can't tell you
how worried I was

06:29.690 --> 06:31.690
that my mane wouldn't be
ready for the shoot.

06:33.225 --> 06:35.194
Ha ha ha ha! Oh!

06:35.496 --> 06:37.696
<i>You were right to be concerned.</i>

06:37.798 --> 06:40.332
<i>Manes are tricky I have learned.</i>

06:40.834 --> 06:43.034
Ohh.. pfft. Tell me about it.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.071
<i>Cleaning is simple</i>
<i>but a magical fix,</i>

06:46.173 --> 06:49.440
<i>could cause any number</i>
<i>of troublesome tics.</i>

06:49.542 --> 06:50.509
Really?

06:50.811 --> 06:51.843
Oooh.

06:51.945 --> 06:55.247
<i>There are tales I could tell to</i>
<i> make your hair stand on end,</i>

06:55.449 --> 06:58.750
<i> horrifying, terrifying,</i>
<i> attempts to mane mend.</i>

06:59.452 --> 07:01.353
Well, I do enjoy a good yarn,

07:01.455 --> 07:04.289
but I'm not sure I could take
any more mane fright today.

07:04.391 --> 07:08.059
Well, I LOVE a
good scary story! Heh heh.

07:08.361 --> 07:11.963
<i> There's the contagious frizz</i>
<i> that spreads friend to friend,</i>

07:12.065 --> 07:15.366
<i> or the story of the</i>
<i> infinitely splitting end...</i>

07:15.568 --> 07:16.367
AHHHH!

07:18.139 --> 07:20.372
Er um.. Yes, well, very
entertaining.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.107
Ah.. Thanks for the
shampoo. Ta, ta!

07:23.409 --> 07:25.410
Anything about curls
that keep on curling

07:25.512 --> 07:28.279
until your whole body
is one big curl?

07:29.616 --> 07:32.451
<i> There is one story</i>
<i> I nearly forgot,</i>

07:32.553 --> 07:35.220
<i> of an earth pony who needed</i>
<i> to clean up her shop.</i>

07:36.022 --> 07:38.523
Wow. That's just
what I have to do.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.725
Ha! Weird.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.562
<i> Perhaps it'd be better</i>
<i> if I were more clear,</i>

07:43.864 --> 07:46.865
<i> you can't clean up</i>
<i> Sugarcube Corner from here.</i>

07:47.067 --> 07:49.868
Gee, Zecora, I can
take a hint.

07:51.170 --> 07:54.105
<i> With just a few drops,</i>
<i> any mess you'll improve,</i>

07:54.207 --> 07:57.142
<i> if you focus on that</i>
<i> which you want to remove.</i>

07:57.244 --> 08:00.245
It won't be hard to focus on the
Super Sticky Celebration String.

08:00.447 --> 08:03.248
It's kinda the only
thing you can see.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.218
Zecora said it would
only take a few drops,

08:07.320 --> 08:11.456
but I figured we should all
chip in...just in case.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.925
Remember to only focus
on the party string.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.328
We don't want to accidentally
remove anything else.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.168
Ooooh! Sudsy!

08:25.239 --> 08:28.473
Ah! A relaxing shower really gives
you the chance to focus

08:28.575 --> 08:30.508
on the fabulousity of your mane.

08:30.610 --> 08:31.342
Ha ha!

08:33.813 --> 08:37.582
Not the most pleasant scent
but it gets the job done.

08:45.591 --> 08:50.461
My mane feels lighter alr--
--AIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!!

08:55.635 --> 08:59.004
It's important that you know
that I am not pointing hooves b--

08:59.106 --> 09:00.439
<i> I don't understand.</i>

09:00.541 --> 09:02.040
<i> Is that you, Rarity?</i>

09:02.142 --> 09:04.676
<i> Why would you think to</i>
<i> point your hooves at me?</i>

09:04.978 --> 09:07.278
Let's just say I understand
why your shampoo

09:07.380 --> 09:08.980
hasn't made a splash
in the marketplace.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.285
Oh... Goodness, Zecora.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.021
You could at least
pretend it isn't that bad.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.890
<i> I'm sorry my dear, but</i>
<i> there's nothing to say.</i>

09:19.092 --> 09:21.626
<i> You just took the wrong</i>
<i> potion from here yesterday.</i>

09:21.928 --> 09:23.128
Oh! Thank goodness!

09:23.330 --> 09:25.496
I thought maybe your shampoo
had triggered early onset

09:25.598 --> 09:26.632
mare pattern baldness.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.868
<i> No, this lack of hair</i>
<i> was put into motion</i>

09:30.070 --> 09:33.339
<i> when you mistakenly washed</i>
<i> with remover potion.</i>

09:36.376 --> 09:37.442
What a relief!

09:37.744 --> 09:40.145
Well, if you could just whip up
a cure, I'll be on my way.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.247
So much to do before
the shoot tomorrow.

09:42.649 --> 09:46.051
<i> As I mentioned before,</i>
<i> there's no easy fix.</i>

09:46.353 --> 09:48.988
<i> Mane mending magic's the</i>
<i> trickiest of tricks.</i>

09:49.390 --> 09:50.822
Ooo. Sorry?

09:51.124 --> 09:53.358
<i> I doubt that your mane</i>
<i> has left us forever,</i>

09:53.460 --> 09:57.028
<i> there's a chance we can fix</i>
<i> it, I think, if we're clever.</i>

09:57.330 --> 09:58.563
Wa-wa-wait..

09:58.665 --> 09:59.931
There's- there's a chance!?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.131
You THINK!?

10:01.333 --> 10:04.469
<i> I need to focus if I'm</i>
<i> to work any faster,</i>

10:04.571 --> 10:07.839
<i> one wrong ingredient</i>
<i> spells utter disaster.</i>

10:08.141 --> 10:10.409
<i> You should go finish</i>
<i> your list of to-dos.</i>

10:10.511 --> 10:14.045
<i> Keep your mind off all of</i>
<i> these mane-losing blues.</i>

10:20.353 --> 10:22.888
Oooh. There's nothing to worry about.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.392
Zecora will have a cure before
I've even finished my to dos.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.395
But I don't know if I can even
show my face looking like this.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.274
I'm sorry, miss, but I
can't match your mane

10:43.376 --> 10:44.776
if I can't see it.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.311
What about mine?

10:46.413 --> 10:48.047
Marigold, I should think.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.982
I'm sorry, but I
believe it was my turn

10:51.084 --> 10:53.117
and I-I-I just need
to pick up--

10:53.619 --> 10:54.786
Perfect!

10:55.788 --> 10:56.755
Now me!

11:00.826 --> 11:03.895
It's wonderful how this display
shows that your fans provide

11:03.997 --> 11:06.097
just the right amount of air.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.433
Well, I owe it all to Rarity.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.469
Oh, so kind of
you to say!

11:10.571 --> 11:12.371
I-- Kindness has
nothing to do with it.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.874
Rarity always knows how to
make something look its best.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.043
Probably because she
looks so good herself.

11:18.645 --> 11:21.279
That ain't something us
non-fabulous folk here

11:21.381 --> 11:22.247
can understand...

11:22.449 --> 11:24.549
Ah! Non-fabulous!?

11:32.224 --> 11:36.127
I appreciate everypony's
interest in our new sofa colors,

11:36.229 --> 11:38.564
but the yellow
one is spoken for.

11:38.866 --> 11:42.199
Oh thank you, Davenport.
Um, perhaps I can pick it up

11:42.301 --> 11:43.233
once everypony leav-

11:43.335 --> 11:44.869
I'll give you twice
whatever the pony

11:44.971 --> 11:46.471
who wants to buy the
yellow one is paying!

11:46.673 --> 11:47.705
THREE TIMES!

11:47.807 --> 11:49.140
But, but, I--

11:49.242 --> 11:50.074
SOLD!

11:57.483 --> 12:00.085
I can't believe how
differently ponies treat you

12:00.187 --> 12:02.154
when you can't command
their attention.

12:02.656 --> 12:04.923
Are you sure that's
what happened?

12:05.025 --> 12:07.358
Wait. You can't command
ponies' attention

12:07.460 --> 12:09.094
because your mane's
messed up?

12:10.496 --> 12:11.596
MESSED UP?

12:11.698 --> 12:14.499
Does THIS look
"messed up" to YOU!?

12:16.336 --> 12:20.105
Honestly, how hard is it to
pretend it's not so bad?

12:20.507 --> 12:21.373
Hard.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.309
If today is any indication of
how ponies will treat me

12:24.411 --> 12:28.913
from now on, I can't simply wait
to see if my mane grows back.

12:31.183 --> 12:32.383
I'm sorry, Rarity.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.419
I'm sure nopony means
to make you feel worse

12:34.521 --> 12:35.620
than you already do.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.856
Didn't you say Zecora
was working on a cure?

12:38.258 --> 12:41.226
Yes, well, even if everypony
isn't utterly indifferent

12:41.328 --> 12:43.494
to my presence, Zecora
might not be able

12:43.596 --> 12:46.031
to fix THIS in time for
the shoot!

12:46.333 --> 12:48.533
Can't you do a spell that
restores some semblance

12:48.635 --> 12:49.835
of my mane!?

12:51.771 --> 12:55.940
The thing is, it's pretty
much like Zecora said.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.809
Fixing manes with
magic is--

12:57.911 --> 12:59.477
Tricky! I know!

12:59.579 --> 13:00.478
I don't care!

13:00.580 --> 13:01.779
Make with the tricks!

13:02.914 --> 13:03.614
Huh?

13:03.816 --> 13:04.549
Oh.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.303
Rarity: This won't do..

13:25.405 --> 13:27.539
I need an actual mane!

13:27.641 --> 13:29.641
But it has to come
from somewhere.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.677
Huh. You can't just make
a mane with magic,

13:32.779 --> 13:34.646
the results could
be disastrous.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.814
More disastrous than this!?

13:50.564 --> 13:53.932
Ohh.. I don't think there's
anything else we can try.

13:54.234 --> 13:57.969
But we- But Zecora said there
was still a chance...

13:58.071 --> 14:01.439
<i> At last, Rarity</i>
<i> I've searched for so long.</i>

14:01.641 --> 14:04.342
<i> What I told you before</i>
<i> was totally wrong.</i>

14:04.644 --> 14:06.711
Zecora, you found a cure?

14:06.813 --> 14:07.946
That's amazing!

14:08.048 --> 14:11.816
Oh! You mean I'll get my fabulous
mane back in time for the shoot?

14:12.118 --> 14:13.618
Oh. No.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.721
<i> I'm afraid I can't fix</i>
<i> it before the big shoot.</i>

14:16.823 --> 14:20.191
<i> But in time the hair will</i>
<i> grow back from the root.</i>

14:21.460 --> 14:23.995
<i> There's no magical cure to</i>
<i> hasten us through it</i>

14:24.297 --> 14:27.232
<i> unless you went backward</i>
<i> it time to undo it.</i>

14:29.134 --> 14:29.935
Uh-uh.

14:30.037 --> 14:33.004
I think we can both say
that's not a good option.

14:40.012 --> 14:43.214
I have always believed that the
right outfit can make up for

14:43.316 --> 14:45.350
any other areas
that are lacking,

14:45.452 --> 14:47.618
but I will need your
honest opinions.

14:48.464 --> 14:49.464
A-ha...!

14:50.289 --> 14:51.556
How awful is it?

14:52.158 --> 14:53.658
Uhhhhh...

14:54.894 --> 14:56.861
OH, COME ON!

14:56.963 --> 14:59.597
Can't anypony
pretend it's not bad!?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.799
We could... um.. try.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.735
Maybe....

15:04.037 --> 15:07.805
Well, if any of you have an idea
on how to make this disaster

15:07.907 --> 15:10.641
look good enough for Photo
Finish's piece in Vanity Mare

15:10.743 --> 15:13.111
on the Most Beautiful
Manes in Equestria,

15:13.213 --> 15:16.647
I'm open to hearing it!!

15:17.049 --> 15:18.049
Is that all?

15:18.151 --> 15:19.617
No problem.

15:22.821 --> 15:27.358
♪♪

15:27.460 --> 15:29.594
I don't understand,
Applejack.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.330
How is milking a
cow going to help?

15:32.532 --> 15:33.765
That's just it.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.568
It looks like we hired
a new milk maid.

15:36.970 --> 15:40.672
This is pretty close to my
color as a youngun.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.010
Just a little down
home ingenuity.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.446
It's a good idea, Applejack, but
Photo Finish is looking

15:48.548 --> 15:51.582
for the most beautiful
manes, not bonnets.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.387
Heh heh...huh.

15:59.158 --> 16:01.626
This'll do the
trick, just you wait.

16:05.031 --> 16:09.801
[gasp] You know, this is really
quite fetching--

16:10.403 --> 16:11.869
Yes! Nailed it!

16:14.072 --> 16:16.274
--just not portable.

16:23.548 --> 16:24.315
There.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.220
Oh, let's face it.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.189
I'll just have to call
Photo Finish and cancel.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.929
I think we all know how
bad Rarity's been feeling,

16:38.331 --> 16:41.199
but I never thought she'd cancel
her shoot with Photo Finish.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.201
You saw her mane, right?

16:43.703 --> 16:44.969
But it's Rarity.

16:45.071 --> 16:48.206
If anypony can turn lemons
into lemonade, it's her.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.609
I guess it's harder for her
when she feels like the lemon.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.378
Well, she's not a
lemon. She's our friend

16:54.480 --> 16:56.280
and right now she
needs our support.

16:59.851 --> 17:01.052
Rarity: Come in.

17:03.788 --> 17:05.523
Would you mind closing the door?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.592
I'm more comfortable
in the dark.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.731
OK, Rarity, you've done
just about enough sulkin'.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.866
Having a fabulous mane
is a wonderful thing,

17:15.968 --> 17:17.535
but it ain't the only thing.

17:17.737 --> 17:18.403
Yeah!

17:18.605 --> 17:21.172
And we're here to remind
you how awesome you are,

17:21.374 --> 17:23.041
mane or no mane!

17:23.343 --> 17:25.810
[sigh] It's lovely of
you to say,

17:25.912 --> 17:29.980
but it's hard to argue
with cold. Hard. Facts.

17:30.082 --> 17:31.650
What facts are those?

17:32.152 --> 17:35.353
That without my mane, I simply
can't shine as I once did

17:35.455 --> 17:39.358
and ponies treat me like the
sad, invisible pony I've become.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.727
Rarity, you're not invisible.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.195
You're our friend.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.631
A friend who started
a fashion empire.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.766
A friend who made us
all feel beautiful

17:48.868 --> 17:50.635
in her lovely creations.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.371
A friend who stuck
by us no matter what.

17:53.473 --> 17:57.207
A friend so generous that she
once chopped off her own tail

17:57.309 --> 17:58.810
to help a sea serpent!

17:59.912 --> 18:02.713
I know you lost some confidence
when you lost your mane,

18:02.815 --> 18:05.049
but unlike your hair,
confidence is something

18:05.151 --> 18:06.817
you can get back right now.

18:08.053 --> 18:10.021
Goodness, you're right!

18:10.123 --> 18:13.191
The only pony behaving
differently today was me!

18:13.293 --> 18:16.994
Besides, one doesn't
shine from the outside in.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.700
Um, Rarity, what are you doing?

18:23.002 --> 18:26.538
I'm preparing to shine
from the inside out.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.573
Awesome!

18:32.545 --> 18:34.278
It's my own fault.

18:34.380 --> 18:37.081
I shouldn't have bought flowers
without asking Spoiled

18:37.183 --> 18:38.449
what she likes.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.285
Well, we don't have much left.

18:41.587 --> 18:42.853
What does she like?

18:43.155 --> 18:44.789
Um, purple?

18:44.891 --> 18:46.524
Rarity: I have a solution.

18:48.193 --> 18:52.697
Rarity, that mane is-- Amazing!

18:52.999 --> 18:57.035
Thank you, although I'm afraid I
missed my chance at Vanity Mare.

18:57.137 --> 19:01.606
Which means I have quite a few
lavender arrangements to spare.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.508
Uh... Is lavender purple?

19:08.848 --> 19:12.417
Hm. The wind-swept look
is very last season.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.053
Perhaps you could
set this up outside?

19:15.155 --> 19:17.088
It's sure to draw
in the hoof traffic?

19:27.533 --> 19:30.868
Photo shoot or no, you
can always use a chaise.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.705
Well, Rarity, if you wanted
to shine from the inside out,

19:34.807 --> 19:38.042
I think this afternoon, you
became the brightest filly

19:38.144 --> 19:39.410
in Equestria.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.913
Oh, pshaw, Applejack, I'm simply
making up for all the time

19:43.015 --> 19:45.483
I wasted feeling
sorry for myself.

19:45.585 --> 19:49.887
I don't know why you were so
upset, your mane looks awesome!

19:50.389 --> 19:52.690
I'm just glad that I have all
of you to remind me that

19:52.792 --> 19:55.660
even if I accidentally use
magical remover potion

19:55.762 --> 19:58.362
on my mane, I can look
good on the outside

19:58.464 --> 20:00.831
as long as I feel good
on the inside.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.035
How did you end up using remover
potion on your head anyway?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.838
[gasp] Pinkie!

20:07.140 --> 20:09.607
If I had the remover
potion this whole time,

20:10.009 --> 20:11.742
that means Pinkie
must have the--

20:12.244 --> 20:14.479
WHHHEEEEEEEEE!!! [giggling]

20:14.981 --> 20:16.080
Shampoo.

20:16.282 --> 20:17.348
Shampoo?

20:17.750 --> 20:21.151
Wow, that explains why our manes
are all so bouncy and soft.

20:24.890 --> 20:28.626
Uh, perhaps I'll fetch the
rest of that remover potion.

20:28.928 --> 20:29.595
Great!

20:30.797 --> 20:33.598
Hey! Is there something
different about you?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.065
New hoof polish?

20:37.102 --> 20:38.136
So you're sure?

20:38.438 --> 20:39.970
You're sure it's
fully recovered.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.106
Yes, Rarity, it's been months.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.074
Your mane looks fine.

20:46.711 --> 20:48.146
Ooooh, look!

20:48.448 --> 20:51.849
It's the Most Beautiful Manes In
Equestria issue of Vanity Mare.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.284
You should read it.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.787
Oh, honestly, Pinkie,
after all I went through,

20:56.989 --> 20:59.824
I'm not sure it even matters
what mane graces the pag--

20:59.926 --> 21:00.992
READ IT!

21:03.295 --> 21:05.596
But.. I canceled the shoot.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.666
We had a little talk
with Photo Finish.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.902
And explained just how beautiful
we thought you were -

21:12.204 --> 21:13.772
inside and out.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.107
While you were shining
from the inside out,

21:17.309 --> 21:19.944
Photo Finish took
a few pictures.

21:21.246 --> 21:23.648
I don't know what to say.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.350
Luckily, you don't
have to say anything.

21:26.752 --> 21:29.053
Your style speaks for itself.
