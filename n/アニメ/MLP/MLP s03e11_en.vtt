<i>Spike is great
Making a jewel cake</i>

00:22.500 --> 00:24.150
Me, that's who.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.500
<i>Been saving up my gems
So fine</i>

00:26.650 --> 00:28.700
<i>For a cake
That is divine</i>

00:30.200 --> 00:32.300
Who are you "hooing" at?

00:33.840 --> 00:35.930
I know. They're delicious.

00:38.760 --> 00:42.010
Now you see them,
now you don't.

00:45.260 --> 00:47.530
<i>This is how you make
A jewel cake</i>

00:47.680 --> 00:49.890
<i>Stir in some gems
And then you bake</i>

00:51.780 --> 00:55.010
<i>Gonna eat, eat, eat it up
Gonna--</i>

00:55.770 --> 00:57.690
What happened
to all my jewels?!

01:02.200 --> 01:04.550
I had a bowl full of them here
and now I don't!

01:04.700 --> 01:07.270
Which means,
somebody took them!

01:09.760 --> 01:12.100
Who? That's what I'm asking.
Who?

01:12.250 --> 01:14.070
Who took my jewels?!

01:15.950 --> 01:18.580
Oh, I'm who.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.030
This cake was gonna be
so good.

01:21.180 --> 01:22.220
Why?

01:22.870 --> 01:24.250
Why?

01:30.960 --> 01:33.624
Whyyyyyyyyy??!

02:12.980 --> 02:15.480
<i>I have no jewels</i>

02:15.630 --> 02:17.520
<i>I have no cake</i>

02:17.670 --> 02:21.570
<i>I'm a sad little dragon
With nothing to--</i>

02:22.760 --> 02:24.530
...Is it?

02:25.599 --> 02:29.330
Oh! Oh goodness, I hope
I'm not interrupting anything.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.660
Well, I do have this cake
to not bake.

02:33.180 --> 02:35.850
Oh, sorry. It's a bad time.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.790
Inside joke, talk to me.

02:37.940 --> 02:41.000
It's just that Princess Cadence
needs us to do a great job

02:41.150 --> 02:42.750
welcoming the head
of the Equestria games

02:42.900 --> 02:44.220
when she visits
the Crystal Empire tomorrow.

02:44.370 --> 02:45.900
Oh, I know all about that.

02:46.050 --> 02:48.390
As if I wouldn't be any help
at welcoming.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.490
Oh, I don't know
what I was thinking!

02:50.640 --> 02:53.210
Of course, you might be upset
for not being invited,

02:53.360 --> 02:56.010
and here I am coming to ask you
for a favor.

02:56.160 --> 02:58.640
You were probably
going to say no, anyway.

02:58.790 --> 03:01.450
All I had to offer you in exchange
was one little jewel.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.110
What was that?

03:05.420 --> 03:07.519
All I have is this jewel.

03:10.870 --> 03:13.080
That's a really big one.

03:13.840 --> 03:18.370
A really big, juicy,
perfect for a cake-topper jewel.

03:18.620 --> 03:20.380
Does this mean you'll do it?

03:20.530 --> 03:22.200
Yeah, sure.

03:22.350 --> 03:24.300
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

03:24.450 --> 03:26.350
So while I'm gone,
you'll take care of Angel,

03:26.500 --> 03:29.120
and tomorrow is Tuesday,
which is his tail fluffing day.

03:29.270 --> 03:31.850
And it's really important
for him to look good.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.450
Wait, what? You want me
to take care of him?

03:36.400 --> 03:38.710
Oh, well, yes.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.730
But if it's too much
trouble,

03:42.880 --> 03:44.860
I can always see
if there's somepony else.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.860
We already agreed on the
whole jewel thing, so I'll just--

03:50.010 --> 03:51.910
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

03:52.050 --> 03:54.710
Angel, aren't you
just so excited?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.000
See you tomorrow.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.470
You know, she's not
the only pony with a pet

04:06.620 --> 04:09.100
that might need
some watching.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.800
All I'm saying is if Fluttershy thought
that her beloved little friend

04:14.950 --> 04:17.800
shouldn't be left alone while
you're busy in the Crystal Empire,

04:17.950 --> 04:20.320
then maybe that's just
something to think about.

04:22.590 --> 04:24.910
Tank's not some fuzzy
little bunny.

04:25.050 --> 04:26.910
He can take care of himself.

04:32.150 --> 04:35.510
He's a strong, fearless
and totally together pet.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.480
All right, you can watch him.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.420
But only because, uh...

04:59.570 --> 05:01.480
Tank's got a strict
flying regimen

05:01.630 --> 05:04.890
and someone needs to make sure
that he doesn't slack off while I'm gone.

05:11.070 --> 05:14.700
You know, the two of us
are very diligent.

05:14.850 --> 05:16.300
Okay, whatever.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.500
Yes, yes. And more importantly,
as for Opal,

05:18.650 --> 05:20.600
she likes to eat every
36 and a half minutes.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.390
You groom her with
her silken brush, head to toe.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.600
And don't forget to pooch
her pillow out in the middle,

05:24.750 --> 05:25.710
that's where she likes it.

05:25.860 --> 05:29.200
And the temperature in the room
should always be exactly 81.4 degrees.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.880
That's the only way
she can get to sleep.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.530
So thanks for your help
and good luck to you.

05:40.320 --> 05:45.100
I think the dragon was expecting
a little something for his efforts.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.530
Almost as beautiful
as the pony who gave it to me.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.790
Shouldn't you be critter-proofing
the library or something?

05:55.940 --> 05:57.230
Tank has a tendency to--

06:01.510 --> 06:04.960
Critter-proofing.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.990
Three down, three to go.

06:08.490 --> 06:09.670
What's that you said, Gummy?

06:12.270 --> 06:15.000
Well, you're just gonna have
to ask Pinkie Pie about that one.

06:15.150 --> 06:16.450
Ask me! Ask me!

06:16.600 --> 06:18.270
Go ahead, ask her.

06:21.320 --> 06:23.810
Of course,
you can have another cupcake!

06:29.700 --> 06:31.530
Yeah. Why didn't you say so?

06:33.280 --> 06:35.320
I'll get you a bigger pond
immediately.

06:36.250 --> 06:38.280
I think what Gummy's
trying to say is--

06:38.430 --> 06:40.110
He's always wanted a pair
of riding pants?

06:40.260 --> 06:42.040
His toenails need
a new coat of shellack?

06:42.190 --> 06:43.950
He wants to floss twice a day
instead of just once?

06:44.630 --> 06:49.130
I think what Gummy is trying to say
is that he'd like a little Spike time.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.540
Who wouldn't?
Spike time is the best.

06:52.700 --> 06:55.640
Alas, it doesn't come cheap.

06:57.170 --> 07:00.260
All I'm saying is that you might
wanna think about a helmet.

07:00.410 --> 07:04.850
You only wanna get hit in the head
by a flying turtle... once.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.490
A thousand plus carats
of pure deliciousness.

07:12.530 --> 07:15.560
Looks like you got a regular
pet day care in here, Spike.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.600
You'll still be able to get
some good playtime

07:17.750 --> 07:19.610
with Winona like you said,
though, won't you?

07:19.760 --> 07:22.540
She tends to get a little wild
if she doesn't get her exercise.

07:22.690 --> 07:24.450
Exercise, sure, of course.

07:25.850 --> 07:28.310
I don't remember seeing
critters on the invite list.

07:28.460 --> 07:30.240
That's because we're leaving
them here with Spike.

07:30.390 --> 07:32.580
He's gonna do a little
critter sitting for us.

07:32.730 --> 07:33.970
Oh, really?

07:38.750 --> 07:42.850
So sorry I'm late.
Silly bunny had hidden his brush.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.480
Be sure you get plenty
on his tail

07:44.630 --> 07:46.480
or it won't get as poofy
as he likes it.

07:46.630 --> 07:48.950
Come on, girls,
or we're gonna miss the train.

07:49.650 --> 07:51.200
One more for the road.

07:51.350 --> 07:53.900
Oh, you little puppy,
come on here.

07:54.050 --> 07:55.850
I love you more.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.600
No, I love you more!

07:57.750 --> 07:59.330
I love you more!!

08:02.840 --> 08:05.360
Oh, I promise
it will be okay.

08:05.510 --> 08:07.870
I'll fluff your tail
twice next week.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.060
Three times?

08:11.900 --> 08:15.550
Oh, I know, it's a chilly
81.2 in here.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.000
Spike, take care of this,
would you please?

08:18.150 --> 08:19.000
You got it!

08:19.150 --> 08:23.140
So, what're you thinking about
that hooting little friend of yours?

08:23.290 --> 08:25.450
Suppose you'll want me
to keep an eye on him too.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.900
That would be nice.

08:27.050 --> 08:29.020
You sure you don't already
have your hands full?

08:29.170 --> 08:31.880
Ah. I'll be fine!

08:32.030 --> 08:34.450
But, just between you and me,

08:34.600 --> 08:37.910
I've gotta give priority
to the paying customers.

08:41.740 --> 08:44.320
You're absolutely sure
you can do this?

08:44.420 --> 08:46.650
Of course! Wouldn't have
agreed to it if I couldn't.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.990
Piece of cake.
Speaking of cake,

08:49.140 --> 08:51.580
I've got a little something
I need to attend to.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.710
Yeah, like, keeping an eye
on a house full of critters.

08:55.970 --> 08:58.960
Uh, yeah. That was totally
what I was talking about.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.450
Relax! Go to your welcoming
thing in the Crystal Empire.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.230
Spike's got it all under control.

09:37.340 --> 09:40.800
All right, sidekicks!
Front and center!

09:41.930 --> 09:43.520
There are six of you,

09:43.670 --> 09:46.720
but there's only one
right here in front of me!

09:48.140 --> 09:50.930
Two. And what I say goes!

09:51.410 --> 09:53.730
Spike, the boss of you,
that's who.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.620
One, two, three!

09:57.590 --> 09:59.320
Come on, number four.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.410
One, two, three, four, five.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.950
Who's missing?

10:12.570 --> 10:14.360
Angel.

10:17.790 --> 10:21.730
All I wanted were some jewels.
Big, juicy delicious jewels.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.430
And now what do I have?
A missing rabbit and--

10:28.170 --> 10:31.110
Oh, little fluffy Angel Bunnykins,

10:31.260 --> 10:32.890
you're so cute!

10:33.040 --> 10:36.210
The natural waves in his fluff
are to die for.

10:40.100 --> 10:44.650
Isn't Angel just the cutest thing
you've ever seen?

10:48.910 --> 10:51.190
Look, you don't wanna
be with me.

10:51.340 --> 10:53.210
I'd rather not chase you around
all over the place

10:53.360 --> 10:55.200
when I could be enjoying
some jewel cake.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.300
Watch me solve
both our problems.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.720
You know, I'm supposed to be
watching him,

11:01.870 --> 11:04.900
but you all have just hit it off
so well, that maybe--

11:05.050 --> 11:08.770
Maybe I could let you
take care of him instead.

11:08.920 --> 11:13.240
We would, but we've got some major
Crusaders business planned for today.

11:13.460 --> 11:17.610
Major. We're getting our
skydiving Cutie Marks today!

11:19.110 --> 11:22.300
Well, I suppose
if you've got other plans...

11:22.450 --> 11:24.650
It's just--
You're so good with him.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.080
Like "get a Cutie Mark
for bunny-sitting" good.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.000
A bunny-sitting Cutie Mark.

11:30.150 --> 11:32.893
That would be adorable!

11:33.260 --> 11:35.030
He does seem to like us.

11:35.180 --> 11:36.750
And we hadn't exactly
figured out

11:36.900 --> 11:39.660
how we're going to pull off
this whole skydiving thing.

11:39.810 --> 11:40.750
You know what?

11:40.900 --> 11:44.260
As hard as it's gonna be for me
to part with these little guys,

11:44.410 --> 11:47.170
I think you should probably
just take all of them.

11:47.320 --> 11:50.450
If you ask me, the more critters
you take care of,

11:50.600 --> 11:54.280
the more chances you have of getting
some kind of critter-sitting Cutie Mark.

11:54.430 --> 11:57.480
Am I right?
Or am I right?

11:59.150 --> 12:00.480
Sure.

12:00.630 --> 12:02.160
- Yes!
- But wait.

12:02.310 --> 12:03.710
How are we gonna take good
care of them

12:03.860 --> 12:05.500
without treats
for when they're good?

12:05.650 --> 12:07.450
And we'll need beds
for when their tired!

12:07.600 --> 12:09.190
And toys.
They need toys!

12:09.310 --> 12:10.600
It's an afternoon.

12:10.750 --> 12:13.160
They don't need all that stuff.
They'll be fine!

12:13.310 --> 12:15.400
We need to be able
to buy them some things.

12:15.550 --> 12:18.160
One jewel might be able
to cover it all.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.500
What would I possibly
be doing with jewels?

12:21.650 --> 12:23.500
I happen to know for a fact

12:23.650 --> 12:26.550
that Applejack gave you a gem
to watch Winona.

12:26.550 --> 12:27.810
Which means...

12:28.530 --> 12:31.530
Obviously no one around here
is getting a Cutie Mark

12:31.680 --> 12:34.980
for kindness towards a poor,
hungry little dragon.

12:35.099 --> 12:36.140
Take it or leave it!

12:36.290 --> 12:37.420
We'll take it.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.480
<i>Gonna put in some flour
And add a little sugar</i>

12:44.630 --> 12:47.080
<i>For my five
Delicious jewels</i>

12:47.280 --> 12:50.450
But pink feathers would look
so good with your eyes!

12:52.390 --> 12:54.620
That bird could use
a little color.

12:54.770 --> 12:57.880
Has anyone seen Tank's head?
Where's his head?!

12:58.330 --> 13:00.000
What've you done
to the turtle?!

13:01.220 --> 13:04.460
Oh, he totally forgot
he could do that.

13:06.760 --> 13:10.590
Yeah. So pretty sure
critter-sitting Cutie Marks are out.

13:10.740 --> 13:13.120
And our critter-grooming
Cutie Marks

13:13.270 --> 13:16.100
probably aren't going to appear
any time soon either.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.600
All right,
load them up.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.820
And you can give me back
that jewel I gave you.

13:21.970 --> 13:24.390
Sorry.
We don't have it anymore.

13:24.540 --> 13:25.800
What? Why not?

13:25.950 --> 13:29.450
How do you think we paid
for the industrial-sized pet hair dryer?

13:49.590 --> 13:52.140
Zecora knows just what to do

13:52.290 --> 13:55.300
about all this bad mojo
that's floating around you.

13:55.450 --> 13:59.190
I'm thinking a cage
and a great big lock might be next.

13:59.340 --> 14:03.100
Zecora can take the bad away
if you do just what I say.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.100
Really?

14:04.250 --> 14:05.600
But before I can do my duty,

14:05.750 --> 14:08.490
I'm going to need
some of your booty.

14:14.550 --> 14:15.660
Where are you going?

14:15.810 --> 14:17.700
You think jewels
are what you need,

14:17.850 --> 14:20.960
but there's no worse mojo
than dragon greed.

14:42.020 --> 14:43.700
Almost there.

14:48.730 --> 14:51.280
Just taking good care
of everyone's animals!

14:54.090 --> 14:57.320
What am I gonna have to do
to get this to go away?

15:02.290 --> 15:04.790
Then this is just
between you and me, right?

15:04.940 --> 15:07.220
No other pony
has to hear a word about it?

15:09.240 --> 15:12.340
A word about what now?

15:16.580 --> 15:18.650
This better be important.

15:21.510 --> 15:23.270
All aboard!

15:23.860 --> 15:24.819
Angel!

15:27.800 --> 15:30.230
I can't have all of these
animals on my train.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.610
Not without tickets
and not without chaperones.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.530
All I need is to get
on for one minute,

15:34.680 --> 15:36.610
grab a bunny and get off!
Promise.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.420
A likely story.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.620
No chaperone, no train!

15:44.330 --> 15:46.620
Skydiving Cutie Marks!

15:48.880 --> 15:50.460
Is three ponies enough?

15:54.650 --> 15:58.930
At least I have you two left,
my delectable little treasures.

15:59.080 --> 16:02.760
All aboard
for the Crystal Empire!

16:02.910 --> 16:05.190
Crystal Empire?!

16:05.340 --> 16:07.700
I've always wanted to see
the Crystal Empire!

16:07.840 --> 16:11.570
I wish I were dressed for it,
but still... the Crystal Empire!

16:11.720 --> 16:13.110
We're not really going.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.410
We just needed to get on the train
so I can get that rabbit!

16:15.560 --> 16:17.530
And when I do, we're off!

16:17.680 --> 16:20.710
- What?
- It's not fair!

16:21.700 --> 16:23.190
There he is!

16:24.460 --> 16:27.790
Next stop, the Crystal Empire.

16:28.060 --> 16:29.450
No, no, no, no, no!

16:35.920 --> 16:37.760
So it seems the Crystal Empire

16:37.910 --> 16:40.580
would be really cold,
but I've heard that it's not.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.260
It's as warm as can be!

16:42.410 --> 16:45.630
Do you think the walls are crystal?
Maybe even see-through?

16:45.780 --> 16:47.990
Can you imagine?
See-through walls!

16:59.690 --> 17:02.910
Take it. Just take it!

17:08.280 --> 17:10.880
It's so beautiful.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.030
Well, enjoy it while you can.

17:12.180 --> 17:14.550
We're not getting out of this car
until we're back in Ponyville.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.330
There is no way, no how,

17:17.480 --> 17:20.090
we're coming all the way
to the Crystal Empire

17:20.090 --> 17:21.460
without looking around!

17:21.610 --> 17:24.010
No pony's gonna get past
this dragon!

17:25.610 --> 17:27.930
Don't make me use this!

17:28.080 --> 17:29.900
You wouldn't dare!

17:42.660 --> 17:43.790
Oh no!

17:54.960 --> 17:58.000
Whoa. Just whoa.

17:58.630 --> 18:00.260
I'm in crystal heaven!

18:00.360 --> 18:02.720
Shh. Quiet there!

18:05.970 --> 18:07.170
There's the bunny!

18:07.760 --> 18:10.440
Please, please. Pretty please,
don't go down there.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.610
I'll fluff your tail!

18:18.070 --> 18:21.440
I'll perm, highlight and blow it out
if you'll just stop!

18:22.070 --> 18:25.330
What do you want?
Name it, and it's yours.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.200
Oh, my goodness.

18:40.340 --> 18:42.100
All aboard!

18:44.970 --> 18:46.890
You're coming with me.

18:48.850 --> 18:50.280
We made it!

18:50.430 --> 18:52.300
Without seeing the palace!

18:52.420 --> 18:53.810
I think this car's empty!

18:55.240 --> 18:57.730
They're coming this way.
Everybody down!

18:59.230 --> 19:01.730
There has got to be
a better solution!

19:03.280 --> 19:05.020
Don't sit down,
don't sit down!

19:06.260 --> 19:08.160
My dogs are barking!

19:09.860 --> 19:12.620
Did y'all hear that?
They really are!

19:15.020 --> 19:17.010
Bummer, Spike got
to miss out on all this.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.410
He would have had fun here.

19:18.560 --> 19:22.440
I'm sure he's havinga great time
watching all the critters back at home.

19:22.590 --> 19:24.360
Think he's still got a handle
on things?

19:25.220 --> 19:27.550
If he is staying calm
and collected,

19:27.700 --> 19:30.200
I bet he is doing
a terrific job as a leader.

19:32.070 --> 19:34.850
Go ahead, bunny.
Do your worst.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.350
I deserve it.

19:38.890 --> 19:40.330
I ignored you,

19:40.480 --> 19:42.550
tried to pawn you off
on someone else...

19:42.650 --> 19:46.630
I didn't take these silly things out
or fluff this like I was supposed to.

19:46.780 --> 19:49.340
I wasn't really thinking
about you at all.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.230
Any of you.
Just wanted the jewels.

19:53.380 --> 19:55.730
I hope you'll all forgive me
someday.

19:56.990 --> 19:57.990
You will?

20:01.220 --> 20:02.630
Oh, great.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.850
I'm gonna be the one
who gives us away.

20:12.780 --> 20:14.180
Where did you--?

20:14.330 --> 20:16.440
You all hear that?

20:27.940 --> 20:30.870
I can't wait to scratch
the belly on Winona!

20:30.999 --> 20:32.280
Oh, I miss her.

20:32.430 --> 20:34.370
I can't wait
to see Owlowicious!

20:35.000 --> 20:36.450
Hello!

20:37.980 --> 20:39.670
Thought we'd meet you
at the station!

20:39.799 --> 20:41.930
So we could hear all about
the Crystal Empire

20:42.060 --> 20:44.240
and find out if you brought us
one of the Crystal snow globes

20:44.370 --> 20:45.850
that they sell
at the train station.

20:45.980 --> 20:48.300
How did you know
about the snow globes?

20:51.520 --> 20:52.990
Lucky guess?

20:53.630 --> 20:55.250
I've gotta hand it to you,
Spike.

20:55.390 --> 20:58.270
You did a really good job
of taking care of the animals.

20:59.890 --> 21:02.950
Oh, Spike,
Angel looks perfect!

21:03.080 --> 21:05.730
You did such a good job
fluffing his tail!

21:05.850 --> 21:08.510
Yeah, well,
we're like this now.

21:09.370 --> 21:10.630
You know who.

21:15.510 --> 21:18.160
So, what are you thinking?
Bake them into a jewel pie?

21:18.400 --> 21:21.650
Six-layer gem cake
sounds pretty good!

21:21.770 --> 21:23.400
Yeah, it does.

21:23.820 --> 21:25.870
It really, really does.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.150
Whyyyyyyyy??!
