WEBVTT

00:06.120 --> 00:08.660
Princess Celestia! We came
as fast as we could.

00:08.660 --> 00:13.300
I need you to wield the Elements
of Harmony once again and stop Discord.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.150
The Elements! They're gone!

00:17.070 --> 00:19.730
Everypony has to play
or the game is over.

00:19.730 --> 00:21.660
And I win.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.110
Our friendship... over?

00:24.110 --> 00:25.300
Who were you talking to?

00:25.300 --> 00:28.220
Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.120
What?

00:29.130 --> 00:32.030
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you.

00:32.030 --> 00:34.320
WHY? Need a good laugh?

00:34.320 --> 00:37.260
What is happening to my friends?

00:37.260 --> 00:42.830
Looks like we might be due
for a big old storm of chaos.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.240
And what are YOU laughing at?!

01:31.520 --> 01:35.210
You ponies are just
the most fun I've had in aeons.

01:35.210 --> 01:36.390
Well, QUIT IT!!!

01:36.390 --> 01:39.490
You better think
before you laugh at the Pink!

01:39.940 --> 01:41.070
...kie Pie!

01:42.260 --> 01:43.600
Oh, yeah?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.020
Well, ha ha.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.020
Quit it!

01:46.020 --> 01:48.020
No. Ha ha.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.300
QUIT IT!!!

01:49.300 --> 01:52.180
No. Ha ha ha ha ha.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.360
Uh, Rarity?

01:53.360 --> 01:54.930
This here diamond o' yours?

01:55.130 --> 01:58.760
Twilight said we should split it
six way, since we uh...

01:58.760 --> 01:59.690
...found it together.

02:00.420 --> 02:03.640
Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine!

02:04.800 --> 02:07.020
Girls, why are you
all acting like this?

02:07.020 --> 02:08.480
We need to stick together!

02:09.190 --> 02:11.550
It's just too entertaining.

02:12.710 --> 02:15.280
Stop it, Discord!
You're not playing fair.

02:15.280 --> 02:18.110
I'm not playing fair?
Perhaps we haven't met.

02:18.310 --> 02:22.660
I'm Discord. Spirit of chaos
and disharmony.

02:22.660 --> 02:23.980
Hellooo!

02:24.280 --> 02:26.360
How are we supposed to find
the Elements of Harmony...

02:26.360 --> 02:29.440
...when you took away the labyrinth
before we could get to the end?!

02:29.440 --> 02:30.970
Oh, wait! Did you...?

02:31.630 --> 02:32.910
How funny!

02:32.990 --> 02:35.810
You thought the Elements
were *in* the labyrinth?

02:40.090 --> 02:43.330
Twists and turns are my master plan...

02:43.340 --> 02:46.730
...then find the Elements
back where you began.

02:48.770 --> 02:51.550
I never said they
were in the labyrinth.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.040
But... But...

02:53.040 --> 02:55.030
Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle.

02:55.030 --> 02:58.100
♥ Maybe the magic of friendship ♥
can help you.

02:58.190 --> 03:01.420
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some chaos to wreak.

03:07.090 --> 03:09.920
Chocolate milk?! I hate chocolate milk!

03:11.820 --> 03:13.330
Think, Twilight, think!

03:13.330 --> 03:15.830
Find the Elements
back where you began...

03:15.830 --> 03:17.600
Back where you began...

03:17.600 --> 03:19.110
Don't touch my gem!

03:19.260 --> 03:22.030
I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha ha.

03:22.030 --> 03:23.380
What's you laughing at?!

03:23.380 --> 03:25.930
Ugh, I just wanna go home.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.170
Wait a minute...

03:27.940 --> 03:30.450
Home! Back where you began!

03:30.450 --> 03:32.180
The Elements must be in...

03:32.280 --> 03:33.900
...Ponyville!

03:34.340 --> 03:37.860
Come on, girls! I'm certain this is
what Discord's riddle really meant.

03:37.860 --> 03:39.560
If we get back to the library...

03:39.560 --> 03:42.150
...I have a book that I just know
can give us a clue.

03:46.690 --> 03:50.160
Good boy, Angel! Mama's so proud.

03:52.540 --> 03:55.720
Weeell, I can see so much better now.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.630
I meant to do that.

04:07.530 --> 04:10.000
Discord's turned our
dirt roads into soap!

04:11.750 --> 04:13.230
Beautiful, isn't it?

04:13.660 --> 04:15.910
This is the new and improved Ponyville.

04:15.910 --> 04:19.090
And these are only my first changes.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.120
This may look like fun, but it's not.

04:27.170 --> 04:30.400
Picture it, the chaos
capital of the world.

04:32.260 --> 04:34.830
I can't picture anything.
It's too dark.

04:36.280 --> 04:39.380
Well, wait a few minutes and you'll
see it in the beautiful light of day.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.440
Or not.

04:42.370 --> 04:45.080
Ponyville the chaos
capital of the world?

04:45.410 --> 04:47.530
Not if I have anything to say about it.

04:47.530 --> 04:49.630
Don't worry. You won't.

04:55.930 --> 05:01.280
Okay, we're here. Everyone please
please please just go inside, please?

05:01.280 --> 05:03.320
I absolutely refuse.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.000
With pleasure.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.940
I hate libraries.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.660
Pleeease, we gotta hurry!

05:18.660 --> 05:21.530
Forget it, Twilight.
I know what you're up to.

05:21.530 --> 05:25.800
The second I go in you'll have your
little minion Spike come and take Tom.

05:25.810 --> 05:28.790
-Tom?
-Well, it's not going to work!

05:31.510 --> 05:33.590
You're not going in
without him, are you?

05:36.260 --> 05:37.200
Fine!

05:51.290 --> 05:53.140
What'd you do that for, Fluttershy?

05:53.140 --> 05:55.220
Cause you just look so peaceful.

05:55.220 --> 05:56.390
I, uh...

05:58.040 --> 05:59.460
Careful, Twilight!

05:59.470 --> 06:01.540
You'll ruin his beautiful finish.

06:01.540 --> 06:02.930
Oh, for the love of...

06:02.930 --> 06:04.390
Twilight, what's going on?

06:04.390 --> 06:06.010
Why's everybody look so...

06:06.260 --> 06:07.140
...gray?

06:07.930 --> 06:10.720
Don't ask. I need you
to help me find something.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.140
Hey, Twilight? What's
soaking wet and clueless?

06:14.140 --> 06:16.550
Fluttershy, I've had just about enou...

06:17.330 --> 06:18.610
Your face!

06:20.220 --> 06:21.950
What's happened to everypony?

06:21.950 --> 06:24.500
I guess you just bring up
the worst in us, Spike.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.600
No time to explain.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.920
We've got to find the reference guide
to Elements of Harmony...

06:28.920 --> 06:31.830
...before somepony does
something she'll regret!

06:32.140 --> 06:33.900
The Elements of Harmony?

06:34.190 --> 06:36.090
Oh! I know exactly where that book is!

06:37.850 --> 06:38.870
Found it!

06:39.900 --> 06:40.560
Ha!

06:40.560 --> 06:44.150
Fluttershy... You better
give me that book!

06:44.640 --> 06:46.070
Keep away!

06:46.640 --> 06:47.310
Hey!

06:47.310 --> 06:48.850
Applejack! Give me that book!

06:48.850 --> 06:50.290
I don't have any book.

06:51.860 --> 06:52.780
Pinkie!

06:53.370 --> 06:54.900
You guys!

06:56.040 --> 06:57.830
Stop it right now!

07:02.510 --> 07:03.400
Mine!

07:03.400 --> 07:05.690
Hey! Do you even know
what you just stole?

07:05.690 --> 07:08.060
No, but if you want it, I want it.

07:10.010 --> 07:11.810
GIVE ME THAT BOOK!!!

07:18.960 --> 07:21.410
Where is she? Where is Rarity?

07:21.410 --> 07:22.350
Beats me.

07:22.540 --> 07:23.720
Lies!

07:31.370 --> 07:33.410
Get back! All of you!

07:33.410 --> 07:36.280
This is my book! AND I'M GONNA READ IT!

07:42.060 --> 07:43.470
The Elements!

07:48.650 --> 07:49.890
The Elements!

07:49.890 --> 07:51.880
They were here all along!

07:51.880 --> 07:52.780
This is great!

07:52.780 --> 07:55.780
Now you guys can defeat Discord
and put everything back to normal.

07:55.780 --> 07:59.500
See, girls? We did it! We've found
the Elements of Harmony!

07:59.500 --> 08:00.900
Together!

08:02.870 --> 08:04.280
You don't even care, do you?

08:04.280 --> 08:05.240
No.

08:05.900 --> 08:09.180
I never thought it would
happen. My friends...

08:09.830 --> 08:11.700
...have turned into complete jerks!

08:11.790 --> 08:15.160
Necklace... Necklace...
Necklace... Necklace...

08:15.410 --> 08:16.110
Aaand...

08:16.110 --> 08:19.270
...big crown-thingy.
Come on, everypony! Let's go!

08:19.410 --> 08:21.910
But, Twilight.
Aren't you missing somepony?

08:21.910 --> 08:25.250
Nope. We've got the liar, the grump,
the hoarded and the brute.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.300
That just about covers it.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.240
What about Rainbow Dash?

08:29.340 --> 08:32.710
Congratulations, Spike. You're
the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!

08:33.320 --> 08:34.230
Me?!

08:34.230 --> 08:37.110
B-b-but... what if she finds out
I've been impersonating her?

08:37.880 --> 08:39.140
That won't end well.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.890
Too bad. You're Rainbow Dash.

08:40.890 --> 08:44.310
Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't
ever have to talk to each other again.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.900
YEAH! WOOHOO!

08:50.040 --> 08:51.070
Move!

08:51.920 --> 08:54.560
Look out! Here comes Tom!

08:58.590 --> 09:03.130
Well, well, well. I see you've
found the Elements of Harmony.

09:03.130 --> 09:05.360
How terrifying!

09:05.360 --> 09:08.230
Discord! I've figured out
your lame riddle.

09:08.230 --> 09:09.930
You're in for it now!

09:10.140 --> 09:13.260
I certainly am. You've
clearly outduelled me.

09:13.260 --> 09:16.770
And now it's time to meet my fate.

09:16.770 --> 09:19.960
I'm prepared to be
defeated now, ladies.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.510
Fire when ready.

09:22.710 --> 09:24.610
Formation! Now!

09:27.440 --> 09:29.550
Rainbow Dash! Get over here!

09:31.300 --> 09:34.180
All right. Let's get this over with.

09:55.540 --> 09:56.680
What's going on?

09:56.680 --> 09:59.600
Mine's workin'. There must be
somethin' wrong with yours.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.050
I hate the Elements of Harmony!

10:02.700 --> 10:03.770
Garbage.

10:04.690 --> 10:05.640
MINE!

10:05.920 --> 10:09.620
Sorry, Twilight. I guess I better get
back upstairs and clean up the library.

10:09.620 --> 10:11.560
Good luck with all this... whoa!

10:13.250 --> 10:15.830
Oops. Sorry, Rainbow Crash.

10:16.680 --> 10:20.090
Bravo, ponies! Bravo!

10:20.090 --> 10:23.560
Harmony in Equestria
is officially dead.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.330
Discord rules, Celestia drools.

10:30.770 --> 10:32.950
It's your fault it didn't work!

10:32.960 --> 10:34.380
Who are you talking to?

10:34.380 --> 10:36.430
Any of you! All of you!

10:36.430 --> 10:37.710
I'm outta here!

10:38.160 --> 10:42.240
I better go too. I got new, better
friends waitin' for me at the farm.

10:43.660 --> 10:46.250
Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.

10:46.250 --> 10:49.010
Fine! Leave! See if I care.

10:49.020 --> 10:50.920
I don't need you guys either.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.380
With friends like you, who needs...

10:54.550 --> 10:55.760
...enemies.

11:19.450 --> 11:20.790
My stomach!

11:22.570 --> 11:25.760
Twilight, you've got to
see what I just did.

11:29.550 --> 11:31.690
It's priceless!

11:35.220 --> 11:40.190
Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've
got to get into the spirit of things.

11:41.030 --> 11:43.700
After all, this is your new home.

11:46.460 --> 11:47.950
Not anymore.

11:50.060 --> 11:51.620
YES!

11:59.860 --> 12:01.630
Pack your things, Spike. We're leaving.

12:03.950 --> 12:06.960
And don't ask where we're going,
'cause... I don't know yet.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.420
Just not here.

12:10.690 --> 12:12.590
Can't... move!

12:12.590 --> 12:15.240
The Princess...
has been sending these...

12:15.930 --> 12:18.220
...since I came back upstairs.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.530
Make it stop!

12:23.730 --> 12:25.540
These are all the letters
I've written to the Princess...

12:25.540 --> 12:27.510
...since I've lived in Ponyville.

12:27.990 --> 12:30.070
But why would she send them back?

12:32.080 --> 12:34.540
"Real friends don't care
what your cover is..."

12:34.550 --> 12:36.970
"Friendship is a wondrous
and powerful thing..."

12:36.970 --> 12:40.710
"And like the path cut through the orchard,
there'll be always a way through."

12:40.940 --> 12:43.260
"The best thing to do is
to stay true to yourself..."

12:43.260 --> 12:45.620
"...special magical connection
with her friends..."

12:45.620 --> 12:47.810
"...maybe even before she's met them."

12:48.320 --> 12:51.070
Spike! Spike, it's all so clear!

12:52.190 --> 12:55.840
Can't you see? Discord's trying to
distract us from what's important.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.290
He knows how powerful
our friendships are...

12:58.300 --> 13:00.590
...and he's trying to
keep us from seeing it.

13:01.110 --> 13:04.410
Do you remember what I said
the first day we arrived in Ponyville?

13:04.410 --> 13:08.240
I told you that the future of Equestria
didn't rest on me making friends.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.140
But the opposite is true!

13:10.140 --> 13:11.910
The friendships I've made
since I've been here...

13:11.910 --> 13:13.970
...would save Equestria
from Nightmare Moon.

13:13.970 --> 13:16.830
And now they need to
save it from Discord!

13:18.610 --> 13:19.990
You're right, Spike.

13:19.990 --> 13:22.040
I've got to fight for my friendships.

13:22.040 --> 13:26.040
For them. For me. For Equestria!

13:28.370 --> 13:30.330
Oh. Uh...

13:30.500 --> 13:32.940
Why don't you just stay here and rest?

13:32.940 --> 13:36.190
I'll take care of the whole fighting
for friendship thing myself.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.830
And so I tried to defeat Discord...

13:57.840 --> 14:01.890
...but none of my so-called friends
would lift a hoof to help me.

14:03.190 --> 14:06.460
Applejack! I'm here to fight
for our friendship.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.840
Oh. Now you wanna fight.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.220
Where were you when
I was battlin' Discord?

14:14.840 --> 14:16.240
Snap out of it!

14:16.840 --> 14:18.060
This isn't you!

14:18.060 --> 14:19.630
You're not a liar.

14:40.850 --> 14:43.110
Wha... What happened?

14:43.440 --> 14:44.460
Twilight!

14:45.020 --> 14:47.670
I saw a vision of us
feudin' and fightin'.

14:47.670 --> 14:51.100
I couldn't face the truth
so I started tellin' lies.

14:51.450 --> 14:52.920
Can you ever forgive me?

14:52.990 --> 14:54.530
I already have.

14:54.530 --> 14:55.650
Come on!

15:00.570 --> 15:02.060
Oh no!

15:02.340 --> 15:05.770
Twilight! Applejack!
I just had the worst dream!

15:06.830 --> 15:10.760
What do you think you're doing?
Get away from my gem! Get Away!

15:16.020 --> 15:17.990
Let us never speak of this again.

15:21.530 --> 15:23.910
Oh, and I... I turned gray!

15:24.430 --> 15:26.160
Can you believe it?

15:27.930 --> 15:29.300
She's not here.

15:29.420 --> 15:32.140
Without Rainbow Dash
we can't use the Elements.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.530
She could be anywhere by now.
We're never gonna find her.

15:35.530 --> 15:37.670
Yeah, we will. Cause she's right there.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.180
Rainbow Dash!

15:39.180 --> 15:40.320
Hey, guys!

15:40.460 --> 15:42.490
We've been looking everywhere for you.

15:42.770 --> 15:43.830
That's nice.

15:44.050 --> 15:45.600
Discord's still on the loose.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.010
We need you to help us defeat him
with your element: loyalty.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.390
Loyalty-schmoyalty.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.650
Have you guys seen Ponyville?
It's a disaster!

15:54.650 --> 15:58.230
I'm staying here in Cloudsdale
where everything is awesome.

15:58.240 --> 16:02.830
How in Equestria could she think that
tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?

16:03.060 --> 16:06.350
The same way he got you to think that
cheap rock was a bona fide diamond?

16:06.640 --> 16:09.410
I thought we agreed
never to speak of it again.

16:09.410 --> 16:11.270
Time for Plan B.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.260
Okay, Fluttershy.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.320
You grab Rainbow Dash
and hold her down.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.280
Applejack will lower me
down from this rope...

16:24.280 --> 16:26.120
...so I can cast
the memory spell on her.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.270
Got it!

16:32.640 --> 16:34.580
Um... I'm just wondering
if it's okay...

16:34.580 --> 16:36.970
...if I hold you down
against your will for a little bit?

16:39.220 --> 16:42.660
Nice try. Ponyville's
your problem, not mine.

16:45.980 --> 16:48.270
Come on, Fluttershy!
We've gotta catch her.

16:58.630 --> 16:59.640
Applejack!

17:08.640 --> 17:12.170
PinkiIEEE! You were supposed
to secure the roOOPE!

17:12.280 --> 17:13.270
Oops.

17:15.010 --> 17:18.580
Rarity! Pinkie! Hold on!
Y'all are slowin' 'er down!

17:18.580 --> 17:22.580
Oh, Fluttershy. Would you
be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?

17:23.530 --> 17:24.850
I can't!

17:24.850 --> 17:27.630
If you can't catch her, Discord wins!

17:28.540 --> 17:32.010
That... big... dumb... MEANIE!!!

17:35.360 --> 17:39.340
Okay, Applejack! Last rope!
Make it count!

17:52.470 --> 17:54.750
Lemme go! I don't need you guys!

17:54.760 --> 17:56.070
Leave me alone!

18:06.530 --> 18:08.680
Wha... What happened?

18:09.280 --> 18:11.220
How's Ponyville?!
Where are the Elements?!

18:11.650 --> 18:13.120
Did we stop Discord?

18:18.890 --> 18:21.290
Maybe it's a little early
for a group hug.

18:33.910 --> 18:38.310
Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.260
Not as wonderful...

18:40.650 --> 18:42.280
...as friendship!

18:44.000 --> 18:45.320
This again?

18:50.120 --> 18:53.560
That's right! You couldn't break apart
our friendship for long.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.980
Oh, Applejack. Don't lie to me.

18:56.030 --> 18:57.890
I'm the one who made you a liar.

19:02.220 --> 19:03.870
Will you ever learn?

19:15.770 --> 19:18.070
I'll tell you what
we've learned, Discord.

19:18.070 --> 19:21.010
We've learned that
friendship isn't always easy...

19:21.020 --> 19:23.760
...but there's no doubt
it's worth fighting for.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.540
Ugh, gag.

19:25.550 --> 19:28.280
Fine. Go ahead.
Try and use your little Elements.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.620
"Friend me". Just make it quick.

19:31.790 --> 19:34.960
I'm missing some excellent chaos here.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.780
All right, ladies! Let's show him
what friendship can do!

19:38.780 --> 19:39.990
Wait, wait, wait!

20:00.010 --> 20:00.850
What's this?

20:03.660 --> 20:04.420
No...

20:10.870 --> 20:14.490
Nooo!!!

21:02.080 --> 21:04.000
We are gathered here today...

21:04.000 --> 21:08.350
...to once again honor
the heroism of these six friends...

21:08.360 --> 21:10.440
...who stood up
to the villain Discord...

21:10.440 --> 21:14.150
...and saved Equestria
from eternal chaos.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.060
