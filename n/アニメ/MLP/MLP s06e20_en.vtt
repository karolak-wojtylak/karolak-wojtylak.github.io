00:01.409 --> 00:03.673
<i>The map is sending us</i>
<i>WHERE?!</i>

00:04.221 --> 00:06.092
<i> Las Pegasus?</i>

00:06.590 --> 00:09.673
But Las Pegasus is a
wild vacation spot.

00:09.963 --> 00:11.864
It's just one big party!

00:12.067 --> 00:15.415
All those lights and sounds,
not to mention the crowds!

00:15.501 --> 00:18.153
Oh! Just the thought
of it is overwhelming.

00:18.486 --> 00:21.950
I know Las Pegasus doesn't seem
like either of your cups of tea,

00:22.209 --> 00:24.320
but I have total faith you
wouldn't have been called

00:24.344 --> 00:26.615
unless you were the perfect
ponies for the job.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.800
Probably not as
bad as we think.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.329
It can't just be
a loud obnoxious party

00:31.347 --> 00:33.193
all the time... right?

00:35.230 --> 00:38.701
Uh, Applejack. It isn't
as bad as we thought.

00:38.953 --> 00:42.289
PARTY ALL NIGHT! WHOO-HOO!

00:42.658 --> 00:44.363
You're right.
It's worse!

01:35.452 --> 01:37.667
Do you think the map could
be on the fritz again?

01:37.944 --> 01:41.058
I mean, this place seems a
lot more suited to Pinkie Pie

01:41.255 --> 01:42.960
or even Rainbow Dash.

01:44.326 --> 01:46.923
If Twilight trusts
the map then so do I.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.526
All we have to do is solve
our friendship problem

01:49.569 --> 01:50.861
and get back home.

01:52.141 --> 01:54.566
Of course, we have
to find it first.

01:54.603 --> 01:57.446
And make sure to experience
our signature show:

01:57.507 --> 01:59.360
Poné Fantastique!

01:59.766 --> 02:02.800
Trust me when I say you've
never seen anything like it!

02:02.984 --> 02:06.098
Unparalleled acrobatics,
unique animal antics!

02:06.264 --> 02:09.452
Your only regret will be that
you didn't see it sooner!

02:09.643 --> 02:12.283
And like everything at
this amazing, incredible,

02:12.320 --> 02:14.603
"I can't believe it
even exists" hotel,

02:14.701 --> 02:17.206
Poné Fantastique is
brought to you by the

02:17.230 --> 02:21.224
Chairpony of Kindness,
Gladmane himself!

02:26.104 --> 02:29.975
Wow. This Gladmane
sure seems impressive.

02:30.123 --> 02:32.363
Well, uh, it is a little embarrassin'.

02:33.224 --> 02:36.123
But the crowds seem to
like it, uh-huh-huh.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.741
Mr. Gladmane?

02:37.901 --> 02:39.673
Just Gladmane'll do.

02:39.833 --> 02:42.344
And it's a pleasure
to meet actual cohorts

02:42.387 --> 02:43.840
of the Princess
of Friendship!

02:44.221 --> 02:46.861
Thank you for coming.
Thank you very much.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.720
You know who we are?

02:48.953 --> 02:51.975
I'm what you might call a
friendship connoisseur,

02:52.073 --> 02:54.843
so naturally I'm familiar
with the friends of the great

02:54.873 --> 02:58.067
Twilight Sparkle!
Applejack, Fluttershy,

02:58.227 --> 03:01.261
it's an honor to have
you here, uh-huh-huh.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.384
I have to admit you're
not the type of pony

03:03.409 --> 03:05.630
I expected to find
in Las Pegasus.

03:07.249 --> 03:10.080
My guests may be looking for
lights, music, and parties,

03:10.455 --> 03:12.923
but working hard
and making friends

03:12.972 --> 03:15.827
is how I turned this hotel
into what it is today.

03:16.086 --> 03:19.501
And how I plan to make it
even bigger. Uh-huh-huh.

03:19.987 --> 03:21.821
Uh, excuse me one second.

03:23.150 --> 03:26.590
Wise ponies may say the folks
that come here are customers,

03:26.689 --> 03:28.153
but I can't help
but thinkin'

03:28.178 --> 03:30.529
of each and every
one of you as friends.

03:30.670 --> 03:33.581
That's why there's a three-for-
one special on apple fritters

03:33.636 --> 03:38.461
in the cafe for the next
hour. Enjoy! Uh-huh-huh.

03:41.372 --> 03:43.649
Would you two like to
take a tour of the place?

03:43.766 --> 03:45.636
I'm just about to
do my rounds

03:45.729 --> 03:48.252
and check on my
friends who work here.

03:49.070 --> 03:51.544
We do have a friendship
problem to find.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.141
Lead the way, Mr. Gladmane.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.147
Just Gladmane,
now, you hear?

03:59.390 --> 04:04.566
AH! Gladmane! You're just in
time to see my newest move!

04:04.843 --> 04:08.227
New moves or not, I'm glad
to have a star like you

04:08.264 --> 04:10.160
working for me,
I'll-tell-you-what.

04:10.516 --> 04:13.575
Oh, don't make me
blush. Now watch this!

04:17.858 --> 04:19.920
Stellar, ah-huh-huh!

04:19.993 --> 04:22.886
Hon-hon, Monsieur Gladmane
himself is here.

04:23.009 --> 04:24.923
Let's run through
the whole routine!

04:25.181 --> 04:27.507
Now, don't make a
fuss for ol' me.

04:27.821 --> 04:30.658
I'm just gonna keep on giving
a tour to my new friends,

04:30.898 --> 04:33.015
Applejack and Fluttershy.

04:33.267 --> 04:34.732
Hi.
Howdy.

04:34.886 --> 04:37.150
If this pony
calls you friend,

04:37.200 --> 04:39.483
you're welcome
backstage anytime.

04:39.673 --> 04:42.258
I owe him my
entire career.

04:42.486 --> 04:45.846
Oh shucks. Well, let's leave
the artists to their work.

04:46.947 --> 04:49.667
Doesn't look like there's any
friendship problems here.

04:51.803 --> 04:54.295
I've never seen a pink
prairie dog before.

04:55.181 --> 04:57.009
I like the folks
that come here

04:57.040 --> 04:59.913
to have a unique
experience, uh-huh-huh.

05:00.086 --> 05:01.864
And we love him for it.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.276
With Gladmane's help,

05:06.313 --> 05:08.855
we've been able to take care
of all these little guys.

05:09.027 --> 05:11.932
Now this place is
overwhelming in a good way.

05:12.984 --> 05:15.156
Oh, glad you like it.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.246
Fluttershy?

05:19.101 --> 05:21.550
Hmm? Oh, um. Coming.

05:24.196 --> 05:25.692
There doesn't seem
to be anything wrong

05:25.710 --> 05:26.935
around here at all.

05:27.187 --> 05:29.089
I figured looking for
a friendship problem

05:29.101 --> 05:31.636
in Las Pegasus would be like
trying to find a needle

05:31.661 --> 05:32.953
in a stack of needles,

05:33.212 --> 05:35.347
but everypony seems to be
getting along just fine.

05:35.581 --> 05:37.316
<i> Ladies and gentleponies,</i>

05:37.495 --> 05:39.704
<i> despite what my</i>
<i> competition might say,</i>

05:39.790 --> 05:42.332
<i> I know you've come to this</i>
<i> fair city to be entertained,</i>

05:42.430 --> 05:43.138
and I assure you

05:43.169 --> 05:45.156
there is nothing more
entertaining than the

05:45.181 --> 05:48.455
astounding acrobatics in
Gladmane's Poné Fantastique!

05:48.720 --> 05:51.501
Oh, I suppose that might be true
if it weren't for the existence,

05:51.581 --> 05:53.963
and far superiorly
entertaining presence,

05:54.110 --> 05:56.270
of the show-stopping
exotic animal act

05:56.393 --> 05:58.966
that Poné Fantastique includes!

05:59.169 --> 06:01.372
Those voices
sound familiar.

06:01.846 --> 06:03.193
They sure do.

06:03.526 --> 06:05.476
Flim and Flam.

06:05.827 --> 06:08.756
Why, I won't even dignify that
assertion with a response,

06:08.953 --> 06:11.452
except to say that if you were
to consider buying your tickets

06:11.483 --> 06:14.603
from me, I might consider
offering them to you

06:14.627 --> 06:16.036
at a substantial discount.

06:16.172 --> 06:18.356
I have always thought
you get what you pay for

06:18.375 --> 06:19.747
and in my humble opinion,

06:19.846 --> 06:23.476
these tickets are a
value at twice the price!

06:23.741 --> 06:27.501
Don't let this price-gouging
charlatan take you for a ride!

06:27.538 --> 06:32.369
Charlatan!?
How dare you?!

06:32.449 --> 06:33.803
Ha! How dare I?

06:33.827 --> 06:36.246
Yes, how dare you.
I call them
like I see them

06:37.224 --> 06:40.055
Well, they certainly don't
seem to be getting along.

06:40.510 --> 06:44.160
You don't suppose we've
been brought here to help them?

06:45.218 --> 06:47.144
Absolutely not!

06:55.920 --> 06:57.987
I know you and the rest
of the Apple Family

06:58.024 --> 07:00.646
have had your issues with
Flim and Flam in the past,

07:00.781 --> 07:02.861
but they're definitely
having trouble

07:02.960 --> 07:05.163
and solving a friendship
problem is important,

07:05.329 --> 07:07.009
no matter who's
having it.

07:07.249 --> 07:09.526
Well, of course
that's true.

07:10.184 --> 07:12.129
For anypony but them!

07:14.523 --> 07:17.686
I'm sorry you had to see
that. I don't know why,

07:17.716 --> 07:20.270
but those two've been fightin'
ever since they got here.

07:20.664 --> 07:22.750
I thought giving them
these jobs might help,

07:22.800 --> 07:25.206
but I guess it just
made matters worse.

07:25.372 --> 07:27.606
Trust me; I know
those ponies

07:27.686 --> 07:29.372
and you're better off
with them apart.

07:29.470 --> 07:31.483
The two of them together
will cheat the hooves

07:31.513 --> 07:32.689
right out from under you.

07:33.033 --> 07:36.596
I suppose you're right.
Flim's such a showpony

07:36.621 --> 07:39.298
and Flam has such a
head for business.

07:39.366 --> 07:41.329
Why, if they ever
did work together,

07:41.415 --> 07:43.889
they'd be runnin' this
place in two shakes.

07:44.110 --> 07:46.996
Speaking of which, I
better get back to work.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.538
Y'all enjoy your
stay now, ya hear?

07:50.658 --> 07:53.716
I'm pretty sure we should
help Flim and Flam.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.298
And I'm pretty sure there's
another friendship problem here

07:57.329 --> 08:00.676
and I'm gonna search this resort
top to bottom till I find it.

08:03.593 --> 08:06.276
I hope you didn't travel
all the way from Ponyville

08:06.313 --> 08:09.784
to try to get me to reconcile
with my no-account brother!

08:10.547 --> 08:13.920
Brother? I don't believe
I have one of those.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.867
Oh, I already know
what he thinks of me,

08:17.040 --> 08:19.101
all show and
no substance.

08:19.236 --> 08:22.270
Well, if he's so smart,
he should have no trouble

08:22.295 --> 08:24.916
becoming a big
success on his own!

08:25.064 --> 08:30.018
Why, he's the greatest salespony
that ever lived, of course!

08:30.080 --> 08:33.433
Just ask him; he'll
tell you all about it!

08:33.710 --> 08:35.907
I'm sure you could work
out your differences

08:35.932 --> 08:38.603
if you just sat down and
talked to each other.

08:38.836 --> 08:41.636
I'm never speaking
to that pony again!

08:55.083 --> 08:58.775
<i> NO! You are</i>
<i> ruining my show!</i>

08:58.972 --> 09:02.375
It isn't just your show
and I'm improving it!

09:02.480 --> 09:06.098
You don't pull a rabbit
out of a hat on a trapeze!

09:06.172 --> 09:08.646
That's the point!
To give the audience

09:08.676 --> 09:12.590
something they've never seen
before: acrobatic magic!

09:16.178 --> 09:17.187
<i> ♪ TA DA. ♪</i>

09:17.310 --> 09:22.098
It's called "blending
genres" and it's AWESOME!

09:24.350 --> 09:26.246
Shouldn't somepony do something?

09:26.726 --> 09:29.809
Ha! They've been doing this
since they started working here.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.775
Too bad, really. If they ever
stopped shouting at each other,

09:32.818 --> 09:34.313
we could take the show on tour.

09:34.652 --> 09:37.975
They'd be way more successful
than staying at Gladmane's.

09:40.633 --> 09:43.723
Now, that sounds like a
real friendship problem!

09:44.283 --> 09:46.750
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

09:47.433 --> 09:49.372
<i> Stop! What are</i>
<i> you doing?</i>

09:49.587 --> 09:52.141
It's supposed to be a
Pink Prairie Dog Pyramid.

09:52.221 --> 09:53.335
It's alliterative!

09:55.113 --> 09:58.744
You said a tower! Why do you
keep changing everything?!

09:59.938 --> 10:02.775
I'm not changing anything.
You said pyramid!

10:04.276 --> 10:08.689
ARGHHH! You are
driving me crazy!

10:10.412 --> 10:12.400
I thought you
two got along.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.649
We used to.

10:13.686 --> 10:16.627
But we just can't seem to
agree on anything anymore.

10:17.963 --> 10:20.375
We used to perform
all over Equestria,

10:20.658 --> 10:22.024
but if we can't
agree on a new act,

10:22.080 --> 10:24.615
we might as well stay
at Gladmane's forever.

10:28.221 --> 10:33.113
Two friendship problems in the
same theater? Now we're talking!

10:34.720 --> 10:36.264
If you count Flim and Flam,

10:36.375 --> 10:40.024
that's three big friendship
problems all in the same place.

10:40.178 --> 10:41.969
Well, I don't
count Flim and Flam

10:42.018 --> 10:44.523
since those two not being
friends isn't a problem.

10:44.590 --> 10:46.406
It certainly isn't
for Gladmane.

10:46.498 --> 10:48.701
It sounds like he's better
off with them fighting.

10:48.984 --> 10:51.760
Actually, the other
ponies' problems

10:51.809 --> 10:53.876
seem to be good
for Gladmane too.

10:54.067 --> 10:57.476
Both the trapeze show and the
animal act would be better off

10:57.526 --> 11:01.150
if they left, but everypony is
so busy arguing that they can't.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.040
Do you think he knows?

11:03.175 --> 11:06.935
I don't know. But I'm starting
to think we should find out.

11:07.846 --> 11:11.396
Of course, Gladmane wants
everypony to get along!

11:11.692 --> 11:15.421
He's the nicest, most
genuine pony I've ever met.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.280
Did the director
put you up to this?

11:19.796 --> 11:22.664
I tell you, if Gladmane
is your friend,

11:22.855 --> 11:24.996
you are welcome backstage,

11:25.138 --> 11:29.446
but if you are speaking
of him poorly, you leave!

11:30.793 --> 11:34.123
Gladmane is the
kindest, most gentle...

11:34.430 --> 11:37.347
...most compassionate
pony I've ever known.

11:37.550 --> 11:40.264
My problem is with him!

11:43.716 --> 11:45.261
I just can't figure it.

11:45.556 --> 11:48.775
The only pony who benefits from
all this feudin' is Gladmane,

11:48.966 --> 11:50.695
but by all accounts
he's the best friend

11:50.707 --> 11:52.006
any of these
ponies have.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.920
Well, Bernard, that adorable
bunny from the acrobat's hat,

11:56.135 --> 11:59.415
claims that every morning,
Gladmane tells the director

11:59.489 --> 12:01.366
that the star wants
control of the show.

12:01.476 --> 12:03.458
And every afternoon
tells the star

12:03.556 --> 12:07.415
that the director wants to get
rid of her. But neither is true.

12:08.344 --> 12:11.661
And the Flying Prairinos,
the Pink Prairie Dog family,

12:11.889 --> 12:13.747
say Gladmane keeps
changing their act

12:13.803 --> 12:16.584
to make each trainer think
the other is doing it.

12:16.781 --> 12:19.409
So, all his talk
about friendship

12:19.446 --> 12:21.058
is just a load of
apple sauce.

12:21.384 --> 12:23.581
He's gettin' them all to fight
with each other on purpose!

12:24.049 --> 12:27.409
But how can we get everypony to
believe that's what he's doing?

12:27.575 --> 12:30.732
There must be a way to trick
him into telling the truth.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.230
Gee, if only
there was a pony

12:33.273 --> 12:35.360
who knew how to
trick a trickster.

12:39.612 --> 12:42.806
Or maybe, a pair
of ponies.

12:42.904 --> 12:47.083
Fine. I guess bringing
Flim and Flam back together

12:47.113 --> 12:49.298
might be why we're
here. Maybe.

12:54.596 --> 12:57.593
Sorry if I don't take the word
of some pony off the street.

12:57.686 --> 13:00.713
Even if that street
is in Ponyville.

13:00.861 --> 13:03.716
But Gladmane is behind so many
other friendship problems,

13:03.852 --> 13:06.498
how can you be sure he
isn't the cause of yours?

13:06.596 --> 13:10.904
Because the only problem I
have is standing right there.

13:11.163 --> 13:12.966
Same here, buster.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.686
Do either of you even know
what you're fighting over?

13:15.895 --> 13:18.338
Gladmane let me know
that ex-brother of mine

13:18.375 --> 13:21.667
thinks I'm just a mouthpiece
without a single good idea.

13:22.092 --> 13:25.827
Gladmane assured me this
former, fraternal foal here

13:25.858 --> 13:28.830
thinks I couldn't sell
heat lamps to yaks.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.556
Sounds to me like neither
of you said those things.

13:31.704 --> 13:34.024
Why'd you believe Gladmane
when he said you did?

13:34.160 --> 13:35.483
Why would he lie?

13:35.710 --> 13:38.049
Because he's afraid that
the two of you together

13:38.080 --> 13:40.578
could move in and
take over his resort.

13:40.793 --> 13:42.596
And if I'm telling
you he said it,

13:42.652 --> 13:45.009
you know it's the
absolute truth because...

13:45.150 --> 13:47.581
You never lie!

13:47.876 --> 13:51.981
Oh, brother of mine, I think
it's time for a little payback.

13:52.110 --> 13:53.298
The "Canterlot Two-step?"

13:53.673 --> 13:56.830
We don't have the chickens. How
about the "Baltimare Flare"?

13:56.941 --> 13:58.504
Uh, my flare isn't
what it used to be.

13:58.744 --> 14:00.123
Listen here, y'all.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.086
If you're a friend of
mine, you're entitled

14:02.116 --> 14:03.600
to a free night's stay.

14:03.803 --> 14:07.218
And everypony here's a
friend of mine! Thank you.

14:07.353 --> 14:08.689
Thank you very much.

14:08.824 --> 14:10.387
Are you thinking
what I am?

14:10.467 --> 14:12.910
The "High
Roller Hustle"!

14:13.833 --> 14:14.732
The what now?

14:14.947 --> 14:18.030
Trust us, when we're done,
there won't be a pony in town

14:18.067 --> 14:20.061
who doesn't know the
Applejackiest truth

14:20.086 --> 14:21.040
about Gladmane.

14:21.606 --> 14:24.313
That is, assuming you
two are willing to help.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.153
What size gown
do you wear?

14:31.753 --> 14:33.218
What's all the fuss, now?

14:33.390 --> 14:37.661
It's the grand-matriarch of the
Rich family, Impossibly Rich.

14:37.852 --> 14:40.529
She's one of the wealthiest
ponies in Equestria.

14:40.910 --> 14:43.236
Well, why didn't
somepony tell me?

14:43.341 --> 14:47.581
You know how I like to give
VIP guests my personal touch.

14:47.790 --> 14:49.944
Well, she's not
exactly a guest.

14:50.406 --> 14:52.818
Word is she's planning
a resort of her own.

14:53.230 --> 14:56.461
I think she's here to
scout the competition.

14:56.775 --> 14:58.713
Oh, really?

14:58.966 --> 15:02.141
And with her bits, she could
take over the whole strip,

15:02.264 --> 15:04.553
hire away anypony
she wants.

15:05.963 --> 15:08.073
Not me, of course.
I love it here.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.436
My good-for-nothing
brother on the other hoof.

15:10.584 --> 15:16.036
Pfft. Impossibly Rich! What
an honor it is to have you

15:16.061 --> 15:18.430
at my humble
five-hoof resort!

15:18.529 --> 15:21.015
I'm sure Flam has
done an excellent job

15:21.120 --> 15:23.236
showing you around,
but nothing could beat

15:23.261 --> 15:27.316
a personalized tour from The
Mane himself! Ah-huh-huh?

15:29.483 --> 15:32.843
You'll have to excuse Ms.
Rich, she saves the energy

15:32.898 --> 15:35.095
other ponies spend talking
out loud and uses it

15:35.126 --> 15:36.720
to make more money.

15:38.086 --> 15:42.627
She'd love a personal tour,
say, in uh, about an hour?

15:42.898 --> 15:45.193
Well, that sounds
right pleasant.

15:45.409 --> 15:48.018
And if you can break
away for a moment, Flam,

15:48.123 --> 15:51.649
I'd love to see you in my
office so I can get ready.

15:56.116 --> 15:58.892
Are all of you sure
this is a good idea?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.338
Abso-tively!

16:00.596 --> 16:03.673
Gladmane is one fish
that's hooked but good.

16:03.790 --> 16:05.704
I sure hope you two
know what you're doing.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.458
Oh don't you worry.

16:07.495 --> 16:10.326
When it comes to throwing
ponies off their game...

16:10.381 --> 16:12.473
...no two ponies do
it better than us.

16:12.824 --> 16:14.701
I can't argue with that.

16:18.990 --> 16:21.600
Hey there boss, Impossibly
Rich is just about ready

16:21.636 --> 16:24.516
for that tour. So what did
you wanna see me about?

16:24.904 --> 16:27.643
Actually, there's something
I want you to see.

16:27.846 --> 16:32.769
The grand plan: Every hotel on
the strip as amazin' as this one

16:32.929 --> 16:35.200
and every one of them mine.

16:36.326 --> 16:40.609
And all it'll take is a little
salesponyship. Like this.

16:41.353 --> 16:43.323
Hey there, friends, ah-huh-huh!

16:43.390 --> 16:45.895
If you think my
resort is fantastic,

16:46.116 --> 16:49.267
wait till you see
Poné Fantastique.

16:49.483 --> 16:53.138
Tickets are on sale now.
Two for the price of one.

16:53.261 --> 16:55.495
Thank you. Thank
you very much.

16:56.289 --> 16:58.455
Now I know Impossibly
Rich has probably

16:58.486 --> 17:00.978
made you a tempting offer
to come work for her.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.006
Well, now that
you mention it...

17:04.080 --> 17:07.286
And as your friend, I'd
never tell you what to do,

17:07.409 --> 17:10.061
but no pony is gonna stand
in the way of my plans,

17:10.092 --> 17:11.550
no matter how rich she is.

17:11.772 --> 17:14.916
And I sure wouldn't want you
to end up on the losing side.

17:15.206 --> 17:17.243
Think you might
consider staying here?

17:17.526 --> 17:18.320
Yeah.

17:18.836 --> 17:20.289
Well, all right, then.

17:24.283 --> 17:25.304
They're coming!

17:26.806 --> 17:31.126
And last, but not least, Ms.
Rich, the jewel in my crown.

17:33.852 --> 17:36.947
Impossibly wants you to
know she's very impressed.

17:37.009 --> 17:38.861
But doesn't think
you can keep a resort

17:38.880 --> 17:40.830
of this calibre
going for long.

17:41.003 --> 17:42.843
Oh, and why is that?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.710
Because you've got the best
talent in the industry.

17:47.766 --> 17:52.043
What stops them from just
leaving to join any competitor?

17:52.350 --> 17:55.464
Well, you see,
I have a trick for that,

17:55.526 --> 17:57.126
I must confess, ah-huh-huh.

17:57.372 --> 18:01.421
And it all has to do with
how I handle my employees.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.027
And how is that?

18:04.904 --> 18:07.323
Well... LIKE FRIENDS, of course!

18:07.593 --> 18:10.080
And I treat every
one of my employees

18:10.184 --> 18:12.387
with the kindness
they deserve!

18:12.695 --> 18:15.593
Oh. That's it?
THAT'S your secret?

18:16.030 --> 18:18.793
There's nothing else?

18:18.892 --> 18:21.310
Nope. Just friendship.

18:21.624 --> 18:23.975
But you know all about
friendship, don't you...

18:24.793 --> 18:26.418
FLUTTERSHY?

18:26.689 --> 18:29.040
You knew the whole time?

18:29.520 --> 18:37.501
Never try to con a con-pony!
Uh-huh-huh!

18:40.313 --> 18:42.615
I'd have thought you'd
hit the road by now.

18:42.843 --> 18:44.886
Whether we were able
to fool you or not,

18:44.972 --> 18:47.704
you can't just go on keeping
ponies from getting along.

18:47.956 --> 18:49.815
It's just mean!

18:50.172 --> 18:53.520
Now maybe it is, but it's
a meanness that works,

18:53.815 --> 18:56.350
unlike your pathetic
little ploy.

18:57.009 --> 19:00.332
I practically invented
the "High Roller Hustle."

19:00.830 --> 19:02.978
But I suppose I
should be impressed.

19:03.212 --> 19:05.575
You're the only ponies to
ever figure out the secret

19:05.606 --> 19:06.529
to my success.

19:06.732 --> 19:09.476
It takes a lot of work
keepin' everypony fightin',

19:09.618 --> 19:12.830
but as long as I keep 'em
convinced I'm their only friend,

19:13.021 --> 19:15.920
all of Las Pegasus will be mine.

19:16.664 --> 19:19.532
Oh, you can't trick a confession
out of a pony like me.

19:19.975 --> 19:22.233
I am always one step ahead.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.824
Well, you better
check your hooves.

19:24.892 --> 19:27.556
Because... you've just
stepped in a confession.

19:28.818 --> 19:31.544
Oh no. Oh no. Wait, wait.

19:31.716 --> 19:33.341
Did that sound OK?

19:33.723 --> 19:35.723
Never better!

19:36.006 --> 19:38.375
Flim and Flam told us
you'd see right through

19:38.406 --> 19:40.953
the fake rich pony bit.
And that once you did,

19:41.187 --> 19:43.378
you wouldn't be able to
resist gloating about it.

19:43.673 --> 19:45.396
This was all part of the plan.

19:45.938 --> 19:50.104
Oh now, now friends! Listen
I can explain everything!

19:50.467 --> 19:52.732
I think you've done
enough of that.

19:52.916 --> 19:53.815
Darling?

19:55.526 --> 19:59.409
Oh! I cannot believe we let him
almost ruin our friendship.

19:59.655 --> 20:02.978
And our act. Good luck
finding another one.

20:04.350 --> 20:08.510
Wait! No! Y'all COME BACK!
C'mon I'm gonna be ruined!

20:08.658 --> 20:12.572
This is Gladmane, y'all!
C'mon you can't do this!

20:13.470 --> 20:16.135
Gladmane has left
the building!

20:20.492 --> 20:22.750
I guess the map wasn't
on the fritz after all.

20:24.916 --> 20:27.033
If it weren't for your
history with Flim and Flam,

20:27.193 --> 20:29.520
you never would have be
so determined to find

20:29.563 --> 20:30.676
somepony else to help

20:30.793 --> 20:33.403
and we never would have found
out what Gladmane was doing.

20:33.495 --> 20:35.784
And if it weren't for you
wanting to show even those

20:35.852 --> 20:37.409
two con ponies kindness,

20:37.507 --> 20:40.018
we never would have been
able to trick the trickster.

20:40.910 --> 20:42.756
It must've felt pretty
nice to finally put

20:42.775 --> 20:45.790
all your connivin' and
cheatin' skills to good use.

20:46.129 --> 20:48.086
In fact, we like to think of it

20:48.104 --> 20:50.603
as a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.578
Emphasis on the "once."

20:52.916 --> 20:55.335
What do you mean?

20:56.418 --> 20:59.680
While this establishment
undergoes a slight change

20:59.729 --> 21:02.707
in management, my brother
and I want to assure you

21:02.744 --> 21:05.969
that it remains the pinnacle
of Las Pegasus entertainment.

21:06.030 --> 21:09.630
Which is why we invite
each and every one of you

21:09.735 --> 21:14.436
to experience the wonder of
the Poné Fantastique Theater

21:14.553 --> 21:17.360
at half the normal
cost of admission.

21:17.575 --> 21:20.018
And, while you're appreciating
this historic venue,

21:20.067 --> 21:21.913
totally devoid of
performers of any kind,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.812
we invite you to use the wonder
of your own imaginations

21:24.873 --> 21:28.369
to fill the space at
no additional charge!

21:31.027 --> 21:32.547
FLIM AND FLAM!!
