00:03.283 --> 00:06.848
Hey Rarity, hey Pinkie Pie.
What are you looking at?

00:06.849 --> 00:08.336
Rainbow Dash!

00:09.278 --> 00:10.963
Isn't she the most daring devil?

00:10.964 --> 00:13.292
I mean, the most devilish darer?
I mean...

00:13.293 --> 00:15.183
She's dazzling!

00:15.184 --> 00:18.937
Oh yeah, that's a good word.
She's dazzling!

00:30.564 --> 00:33.644
- Oh no, oh no, oh no!
- Ayayayayay!

00:36.238 --> 00:38.242
So much for dazzling...

00:40.940 --> 00:46.100

01:18.272 --> 01:20.027
<i>Is she gonna be okay?</i>

01:21.244 --> 01:23.291
<i>I'm so worried!</i>

01:23.986 --> 01:26.241
Is her face gonna stay that way?

01:32.906 --> 01:36.385
- How is she, doctor?
- She's going to be fine.

01:36.386 --> 01:39.280
Luckily, she has friends like you
who got her over here in a jiffy.

01:39.681 --> 01:43.785
How long do I need to lie here?
I've got things I need to do!

01:43.786 --> 01:45.944
Well, that all depends on your recovery.

01:45.945 --> 01:47.569
But I'd say a few days minimum.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.346
You guys have gotta get me out of here!

01:49.347 --> 01:51.304
I'm gonna climb the walls!

01:51.505 --> 01:52.920
Just like a spider!

01:52.921 --> 01:55.993
Did the crash somehow give her
super-duper spider powers?

01:55.994 --> 01:56.994
No.

01:56.995 --> 01:59.557
Nor did it give her amazing
healing powers.

01:59.558 --> 02:01.712
She needs to stay in bed for a few days.

02:01.713 --> 02:05.846
Few days? Might as well be
a few months, or few years!

02:05.847 --> 02:08.004
It's not so bad, Rainbow Dash.

02:08.005 --> 02:10.559
I bet the chow in here
is hoof-lickin' good!

02:10.560 --> 02:13.946
And the hospital gowns,
they match the curtains!

02:14.277 --> 02:17.177
And look!
You have a roommate!

02:36.538 --> 02:38.196
What's this?

02:38.899 --> 02:42.702
"Daring Do and the Quest
for the Sapphire Stone."

02:42.703 --> 02:44.828
This is the first story in the series.

02:44.829 --> 02:46.236
I own all of them.

02:47.386 --> 02:51.087
No thanks.
I so don't read.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.950
I'm a world-class athlete.

02:52.951 --> 02:55.516
Reading's for eggheads like you,
Twilight.

02:55.717 --> 02:59.031
No offense, but I am not reading.

02:59.032 --> 03:03.221
It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool.

03:06.512 --> 03:07.808
Is she serious?

03:07.809 --> 03:10.641
Who doesn't like to read
a bang-up tale from time to time?

03:10.642 --> 03:15.968
A good book is almost as magnificent as
silk pajamas on a Sunday morning.

03:15.969 --> 03:19.100
Reading is for everypony,
Rainbow Dash!

03:19.701 --> 03:21.459
Yeah! I love reading.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.406
And my head isn't even close
to the shape of an egg!

03:23.407 --> 03:25.302
It's more the shape of an apple,
or maybe an orange!

03:25.303 --> 03:27.603
But a big orange,
more like a grapefruit really...

03:28.236 --> 03:30.340
All right, my little ponies.

03:30.341 --> 03:31.980
Rainbow Dash needs her rest.

03:31.981 --> 03:34.021
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

03:36.102 --> 03:39.032
I think you'd like Daring.
She's a lot like you.

03:39.033 --> 03:45.539
Adventurous, fierce and undeniably,
unquestionably, unstoppable.

04:15.315 --> 04:18.317
...to get to the other side!
Get it?

04:20.979 --> 04:22.443
Nevermind...

04:52.188 --> 04:57.060
As Daring-Do trekked through
the tropical jungle, the wet heat

04:57.061 --> 05:00.903
sapped her energy and
slowed her every step.

05:00.904 --> 05:03.795
If only she could escape
this oppressive atmosphere

05:03.796 --> 05:06.682
and fly up into the cool blue sky...

05:06.683 --> 05:10.109
But her crash landing in the jungle
had injured her wing

05:10.110 --> 05:12.046
and she was grounded for a few days.

05:12.047 --> 05:16.914
Few days... it might as well be
a few months, or a few years!

05:17.115 --> 05:19.301
I'm right there with you, sister.

05:19.802 --> 05:22.182
The mosquitoes buzzed loudly.

05:22.183 --> 05:24.980
<i>The macaws cried from the high trees.</i>

05:24.981 --> 05:29.031
<i>Yet, all of these distracting noises
were not enough to cover the sound</i>

05:29.032 --> 05:32.188
<i>of the predators following her every step.</i>

06:10.792 --> 06:16.265
<i>Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally
allowed herself a moment to breathe.</i>

06:17.972 --> 06:23.142
<i>She turned around to find herself
face to face with the long lost temple</i>

06:23.143 --> 06:27.717
<i>that she had sought tirelessly
for over sixty days and nights!</i>

06:28.331 --> 06:32.710
I hate to admit it to myself, and would
really hate to admit it to my friends

06:32.711 --> 06:35.823
but... I love this story!

06:38.028 --> 06:39.654
I love reading!

06:42.932 --> 06:45.018
I'm an egghead.

06:53.636 --> 06:57.444
<i>The smell of decay and danger
hit Daring-Do as she peered into</i>

06:57.445 --> 07:01.477
<i>the dimly-lit entrance
of the ancient temple.</i>

08:18.776 --> 08:20.318
Hi Rainbow Dash!

08:20.319 --> 08:22.952
Uh, hey, guys...

08:22.953 --> 08:24.942
We thought we'd come and cheer you up!

08:25.788 --> 08:27.691
We brought your favorite board game!

08:28.883 --> 08:30.987
We know how much you like to win!

08:33.185 --> 08:35.350
You go first, Rainbow Dash!

08:36.482 --> 08:38.443
No no, you first.

08:40.987 --> 08:44.052
Alright... cloud three.

08:44.053 --> 08:47.506
Aw,shucks, you... rained on my cumulus.

08:47.607 --> 08:48.807
Go again!

08:49.504 --> 08:50.935
Sky five?

08:51.669 --> 08:53.361
You found my seagull!

08:54.841 --> 08:57.007
- Cloud two?
- You zapped my weather pony!

08:57.408 --> 09:00.749
You stung my bumblebee.
Oh, my thunderbolt.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.701
And that's my last cloud.
You found it.

09:03.702 --> 09:05.313
Guess you guys win, I lose.

09:06.818 --> 09:10.415
But Rainbow Dash,
you didn't even get a turn.

09:11.732 --> 09:13.294
You win some, you lose some.

09:13.934 --> 09:15.676
But you don't lose some.

09:15.677 --> 09:17.769
I don't think you've
ever lost a game of...

09:17.770 --> 09:18.903
Thanks for coming!

09:18.904 --> 09:21.600
But yesterday you were
desperate for things to do!

09:21.601 --> 09:23.896
Do? Who said anything about Daring-Do?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.321
I told you I'm not interested in reading.

09:27.811 --> 09:29.646
It's nap time for me!

09:32.081 --> 09:34.696
Glad we could... cheer you up?

09:41.823 --> 09:43.802
Alright then.

09:49.666 --> 09:53.377
Daring-Do stood at the entrance
to the central temple chamber.

09:53.378 --> 09:58.612
<i>At last, she was face-to-face with
the legendary sapphire statue!</i>

10:15.466 --> 10:17.715
There must be a pattern here.

10:17.716 --> 10:20.788
What do all these animals have in common?

10:24.007 --> 10:26.513
These animals are all predators!

10:26.514 --> 10:29.879
Except... rats!

12:09.821 --> 12:12.701
Hello, Rainbow Dash!

12:18.869 --> 12:20.932
How's our patient doing today?

12:22.443 --> 12:24.249
We need to get some fresh air in here.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.140
You're lookin' sweatier than a pig
wrangler on a summer's day.

12:27.924 --> 12:30.739
Well, guys, thanks for visiting, but...

12:30.740 --> 12:33.502
Okay, now, dinner time for Rainbow Dash.

12:35.865 --> 12:39.222
Just in time.
I am so hungry.

12:39.223 --> 12:41.147
Don't mind us, Rainbow Dash.

12:41.670 --> 12:43.173
Yeah, just go ahead and eat up.

12:57.979 --> 12:59.653
On second thought...

12:59.654 --> 13:01.801
We'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash.

13:06.593 --> 13:09.850
"You thought you could evade me
and capture the relic for yourself."

13:09.851 --> 13:12.764
"But you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do."

13:12.965 --> 13:17.286
And now, you shall meet your doom!

13:30.737 --> 13:32.453
Who is this dude?

13:35.526 --> 13:38.006
You won't get away with this, Ahuizotl!

13:38.007 --> 13:40.454
But I already have...

13:44.451 --> 13:46.105
Not again...

14:05.171 --> 14:06.632
Quicksand!

14:08.328 --> 14:09.420
<i>Rainbow Dash?</i>

14:10.192 --> 14:11.238
<i>Rainbow Dash?</i>

14:12.548 --> 14:15.015
Rainbow Daaaash?

14:18.181 --> 14:20.473
- Oh, good evenin...
- Morning.

14:20.474 --> 14:22.457
...morning, Doc.

14:24.394 --> 14:25.893
Have you been up all night?

14:26.194 --> 14:27.395
Of course not.

14:29.239 --> 14:31.095
Well, I'll be quick.

14:31.096 --> 14:34.301
Congratulations, Rainbow Dash,
we're checking you out of the hospital.

14:34.302 --> 14:36.379
What?
Later today?

14:36.680 --> 14:38.941
No.
Right now!

14:38.942 --> 14:41.277
Right now?!
Right now, right now?

14:41.278 --> 14:42.778
Right now, right now.

14:44.583 --> 14:45.993
But I don't feel better!

14:45.994 --> 14:47.997
Now take it easy, Rainbow Dash.

14:47.998 --> 14:50.493
Remember to stay off
that wing for a week.

14:58.887 --> 15:02.411
How will I ever find out
what happened to Daring-Do?!

15:05.485 --> 15:08.092
Is Ahuizotl gonna get away
with the statuette?

15:08.493 --> 15:10.385
What's gonna happen to Daring?!

15:12.410 --> 15:14.379
Twilight has a copy of the book!

15:14.910 --> 15:18.401
But I can't ask her after
I called her an egghead and all...

15:20.176 --> 15:22.818
This is making me sick all over again!

15:29.444 --> 15:32.913
The pain... the pain!

15:32.914 --> 15:34.878
Rainbow Dash, what are you doing here?

15:34.879 --> 15:35.879
Anything wrong?

15:36.949 --> 15:39.611
My wing!
It's still hurting, Doc.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.984
Ouch!
Right there.

15:45.285 --> 15:47.403
I was touching your good wing.

15:48.108 --> 15:49.386
Uh, right.

15:49.387 --> 15:52.326
Well, I think that one's hurting now too.

15:54.045 --> 15:55.782
I think I know what the trouble is.

15:55.783 --> 15:58.974
A severe case of lazy-itis.

15:59.924 --> 16:01.918
But, you got me all wrong, Doc!

16:01.919 --> 16:03.456
I'm not being lazy!

16:03.457 --> 16:05.115
You're fine, Rainbow Dash.

16:05.116 --> 16:07.827
Give it some time and you'll be
right back in the swing of things.

16:07.828 --> 16:09.696
Good day, Rainbow Dash.

16:09.697 --> 16:10.697
Take care!

16:11.636 --> 16:13.231
What am I gonna do?

16:13.232 --> 16:16.803
I'll never get to sleep without knowing
what happens to Daring-Do!

16:18.263 --> 16:21.509
Which may not be such a bad thing...

17:07.591 --> 17:12.188
Feels like the harder I struggle,
the tighter the ropes get!

17:12.739 --> 17:14.613
<i>Burglar, burglar!</i>

17:14.614 --> 17:17.293
Someone's trying to steal my slippers!

17:18.496 --> 17:22.438
I'm not trying to steal your slippers,
I'm trying to steal this book!

17:26.401 --> 17:27.978
Stop, thief!

17:53.965 --> 17:56.157
Hey, nopony invited me!

18:14.490 --> 18:16.905
Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?

18:22.700 --> 18:24.802
Rainbow Dash,
what in the world is going on?

18:24.803 --> 18:26.393
Why are you stealing slippers?

18:28.590 --> 18:30.217
Hey, get back to the hospital!

18:32.710 --> 18:34.101
What's all the ruckus?

18:34.402 --> 18:36.836
I'd say it's more of a fracas
than a ruckus.

18:37.037 --> 18:39.297
What's going on, Rainbow Dash?

18:42.286 --> 18:43.890
I'm an egghead.

18:44.091 --> 18:45.191
Pardon?

18:45.492 --> 18:49.276
See, I was trying to get back into
the hospital to finish the last chapter of...

18:49.277 --> 18:52.460
"Daring-Do and the Quest
for the Sapphire Statue"!

18:52.461 --> 18:53.861
You got me.

18:54.917 --> 18:57.567
I knew the book was good,
but I didn't know it could drive

18:57.568 --> 18:59.068
a pony to petty theft!

18:59.069 --> 19:02.128
Good? Try awesomely amazing.

19:02.129 --> 19:07.381
That book is undeniably,
unquestionably, un-put-down-able!

19:07.782 --> 19:11.700
But then I had to put it down.
I was sent home before I could finish it.

19:11.701 --> 19:14.039
Well, I'm glad that's all this is about.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.619
There's no reason to go
around causin' a ruckus...

19:16.620 --> 19:17.711
Fracas!

19:17.712 --> 19:21.226
...causin' a fracas,
just because you like to read.

19:23.475 --> 19:26.115
Like I said, I have
every book in the series.

19:26.116 --> 19:28.741
And you can borrow them all,
any time you like!

19:30.023 --> 19:31.408
Thanks, Twilight.

19:31.609 --> 19:34.087
I'm sorry I made such a big deal
about all of this.

19:34.088 --> 19:36.923
I thought reading was just
for smart ponies like you.

19:36.924 --> 19:40.867
Rainbow Dash, just because you're athletic
doesn't mean you aren't smart!

19:40.868 --> 19:43.434
Yeah!
Just look at me!

19:48.830 --> 19:52.676
Reading is something everypony can enjoy,
if they just give it a try.

19:52.677 --> 19:54.377
Yeah, I get it.

19:54.378 --> 19:57.087
I shouldn't knock something
until I've tried it.

19:57.088 --> 19:58.588
That's a great lesson.

19:58.589 --> 20:01.145
And it would make a great letter
to the Princess.

20:01.596 --> 20:04.351
- Did you get all that?
- Yeah...?

20:04.352 --> 20:05.352
Great!

20:05.353 --> 20:07.820
You write the letter,
I've gotta finish this book!

20:36.640 --> 20:39.543
Another day, another dungeon!

20:42.109 --> 20:48.077
With Daring-Do out of the way,
the world will suffer mightily at my hands.

20:48.178 --> 20:51.647
I am victorious!

20:56.032 --> 20:57.772
I'll take that!

20:59.388 --> 21:02.060
Wha...?
Noooooooo!

21:02.061 --> 21:04.932
Better luck next time, Ahuizotl!

21:06.402 --> 21:09.725
Curse you, Daring-Do!

21:12.192 --> 21:16.714
And so, with Ahuizotl defeated,
and the sapphire statue secured...

21:16.715 --> 21:19.959
...the world was safe and sound,
once again.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.568
Thanks to Daring-Do!

21:26.732 --> 21:29.827
Daring-Do and the Griffon's Goblet...

21:30.328 --> 21:31.887
Awesome!
