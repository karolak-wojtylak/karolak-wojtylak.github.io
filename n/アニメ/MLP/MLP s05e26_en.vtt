00:04.240 --> 00:05.980
Starlight Glimmer?

00:06.200 --> 00:07.760
I was sure I saw her, Spike.

00:08.180 --> 00:10.640
Welcome home, Twilight!

00:11.480 --> 00:14.680
We travelled back in time to
when Rainbow Dash performed

00:14.680 --> 00:16.200
her first Sonic Rainboom?

00:17.980 --> 00:20.780
Without the Rainboom,
you and your friends

00:20.780 --> 00:23.900
will never form your
special cutie mark bond.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.480
But whatever Starlight did in
the past changed things here.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.360
I don't want to live in
that awful future we saw.

00:31.780 --> 00:32.960
I don't think
you'll have to.

00:33.460 --> 00:36.520
All servants of Queen
Chrysalis found in these woods

00:36.520 --> 00:39.120
must be destroyed!

00:45.279 --> 00:47.212

We have muffins!

01:18.460 --> 01:22.320
Wait! We're not changelings!
I'm a pony! And he's a dragon!

01:23.000 --> 01:24.920
A likely story!

01:25.180 --> 01:26.320
Do something dragonish!

01:30.120 --> 01:30.920
That works.

01:31.390 --> 01:33.480
The servants of Chrysalis
will do anything

01:33.480 --> 01:35.320
to save their evil skins!

01:35.940 --> 01:36.900
STOP!

01:38.360 --> 01:39.640
If they are
changelings,

01:39.640 --> 01:41.060
we'll soon see.

01:41.860 --> 01:44.660
Though I think they're not
what they appear to be.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.020
Zecora! Please,
you have to listen.

01:51.460 --> 01:54.500
Beneath this salve
no changeling hides,

01:54.820 --> 01:57.340
for it reveals the
truth inside.

02:05.800 --> 02:06.680
What does it mean?

02:07.180 --> 02:09.480
The meaning is far worse, I see.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.680
For it is we who should not be.

02:13.260 --> 02:14.720
I think I can explain.

02:15.130 --> 02:18.280
I'm sure you can, but
let's not talk here.

02:18.740 --> 02:21.600
Chrysalis and her army
will soon draw near.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.700
The changelings took
over not long ago,

02:29.980 --> 02:32.920
though I'll wager in
your world that isn't so.

02:33.580 --> 02:36.140
Chrysalis and her army tried
to take over Canterlot,

02:36.420 --> 02:38.020
but my friends
and I stopped her.

02:38.290 --> 02:41.260
Those friends as you know
them are not here, alas.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.860
But tell me how all
this came to pass.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.420
Starlight Glimmer. A pony
who traveled back in time

02:48.420 --> 02:51.160
to stop my friends and me
from ever coming together.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.380
And it is these friends
you have in life,

02:53.600 --> 02:55.900
that keep Equestria
free from strife?

02:56.200 --> 02:58.960
I guess so. But this is the
second time I've come back

02:58.960 --> 03:01.120
and this world is even
worse than the last one.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.040
If Starlight keeps doing
the same thing in the past,

03:04.320 --> 03:06.180
how could the present
be so different?

03:06.487 --> 03:12.858
Ahhh, time is a river where even
the tiniest changes seen...

03:13.140 --> 03:17.120
Can lead to a cascade
of effects downstream.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.500
This part of the forest
is dark and damp,

03:24.660 --> 03:26.900
but it's done well
to hide our camp.

03:36.580 --> 03:37.580
This is cozy.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.360
Please, you have to help us!

03:42.620 --> 03:44.480
The changelings
attacked Ponyville.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.540
We barely escaped
with our lives!

03:48.080 --> 03:50.020
The only changeling
attack I see

03:50.320 --> 03:52.460
is the one that come
here looking for me.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.960
It's taken quite a while
to find you, Zecora.

04:11.020 --> 04:13.740
What a lovely
village you've chosen

04:13.740 --> 04:16.660
to stage your little resistance.

04:17.280 --> 04:20.400
It looks absolutely
delicious!

04:23.180 --> 04:26.700
Oh, come now, Zecora,
you're vastly outnumbered.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.770
I know you don't want
your charges hurt.

04:39.060 --> 04:41.710
Come quietly to the
dungeons of Canterlot

04:41.980 --> 04:44.680
and I promise to leave
the others alone.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.880
Why would she ever trust you!

04:47.240 --> 04:49.520
Even if there's a chance
Chrysalis will honor her word,

04:49.700 --> 04:50.640
shouldn't you try?

04:50.820 --> 04:52.920
Race to the map while we
hold off their attack.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.540
Stop Starlight and put the
whole world back on track.

04:57.460 --> 05:00.200
Time to make a decision, Zecora.

05:00.420 --> 05:02.100
Even if what you are
saying were true,

05:02.440 --> 05:05.140
we'd never surrender
to a creature like you.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.900
Not bad. But it's going to
take a lot more than that!

05:42.260 --> 05:44.880
Lucky for you, there's
more where that came from!

05:57.320 --> 05:59.640
You've really got
to work on your aim!

06:10.640 --> 06:11.340
WHOA!

06:14.240 --> 06:16.700
What are you doing? You
have to finish your race!

06:16.860 --> 06:20.020
No way! This is
way more exciting.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.380
See? You can't stop me
no matter what you do.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.460
Aw, man!

06:33.560 --> 06:34.690
That's strange.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.120
Well, you obviously
don't mean us failing,

06:37.120 --> 06:39.340
because that's becoming
pretty routine.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.740
No. It's just the other
times we've come back,

06:41.740 --> 06:43.600
it's been day, but look.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.000
Why would the map
would bring us back

06:47.000 --> 06:48.980
to a different time of
day than when we left?

06:49.380 --> 06:51.540
Um, maybe we should
figure it out later.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.940
The Castle of the Two Sisters!

07:16.360 --> 07:18.000
Well, don't just stand here!

07:32.140 --> 07:34.160
This place looks a lot
cleaner than I remember.

07:36.660 --> 07:37.540
Rarity?

07:39.280 --> 07:41.280
The castle isn't open
for viewings today.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.040
The tapestries all need
changing... again.

07:44.340 --> 07:45.900
Rarity, it's me.

07:46.260 --> 07:50.630
I don't socialize with dragons.
I don't know anypony who would.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.380
Rarity, you have
to listen to me.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.340
The future of
Equestria is at stake.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.240
I don't know how
you know my name,

07:58.400 --> 08:00.700
but I am far too busy to
entertain some tourist's

08:00.700 --> 08:02.080
ridiculous fantasies.

08:02.460 --> 08:04.950
I have to get back to the
map so I can stop Starlight

08:04.950 --> 08:07.880
from changing the past because
every present I come to

08:07.880 --> 08:09.220
is worse than the last!

08:09.500 --> 08:11.600
Time travel, you say?

08:19.220 --> 08:22.530
Now that's something
I would like to see.

08:33.060 --> 08:36.480
Tell me how you came by this
magic to travel through time.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.700
The Princess asked
you a question!

08:40.200 --> 08:42.320
And unless you want to
end up in the dungeon,

08:42.560 --> 08:44.400
you'll tell her what
she wants to know.

08:45.580 --> 08:49.580
No pony in my kingdom but
me should possess a magic

08:49.700 --> 08:51.900
powerful enough to change time.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.100
Your kingdom?

08:54.220 --> 08:55.280
Who else?

08:55.960 --> 08:58.180
Um, Celestia, of course.

09:05.560 --> 09:09.160
My sister has been imprisoned
in the moon for years!

09:09.820 --> 09:12.440
But it is no less a fate
than she sentenced me to.

09:12.820 --> 09:16.500
Now. Reveal to me the
source of this time magic.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.100
All right.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.540
Twilight! No!

09:21.820 --> 09:23.200
We have no choice, Spike.

09:24.380 --> 09:25.480
I can take you to it,

09:25.780 --> 09:27.840
but you'll have to get
past the Timber Wolves.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.020
I am the ruler of
all of Equestria.

09:31.460 --> 09:34.620
Do you think I can't
deal with Timber Wolves?

09:35.240 --> 09:37.680
No. I know you can.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.060
And if you were thinking
of trying to escape...

09:44.700 --> 09:47.880
it would be very
unfortunate for your friend.

09:58.460 --> 09:59.560
How does it work?

09:59.880 --> 10:01.800
A pony from my time used a spell

10:01.800 --> 10:03.840
to travel back and
change the past.

10:04.180 --> 10:06.420
And now you will give
this spell to me.

10:07.220 --> 10:10.020
With it, I will ensure that
the Elements of Harmony

10:10.020 --> 10:13.500
are never found and
my rein lasts forever!

10:13.880 --> 10:14.700
But it won't.

10:15.240 --> 10:15.920
What?

10:16.240 --> 10:19.260
In my world, my friends
and I found the elements

10:19.440 --> 10:20.980
and used them to defeat you.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.960
And I will do
everything in my power

10:22.960 --> 10:24.720
to bring that world back.

10:25.160 --> 10:25.780
NO!

10:30.560 --> 10:32.140
NOOOOOOO!

10:36.540 --> 10:40.120
Now more than ever, I know how
important it is to stop you.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.760
Well, good luck!

10:47.380 --> 10:48.480
Whoa!

11:30.720 --> 11:33.600
Up for another race-ending
fight, Twilight?

11:35.560 --> 11:38.380
No. You were right.
I can't stop you.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.200
But you can't stop
me from trying

11:42.460 --> 11:45.060
and we could be stuck doing
this for all eternity.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.960
If that's what it takes to
keep you and your friends

11:47.960 --> 11:51.340
from getting your cutie mark
connection, then I'm game.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.960
What you're doing goes
way beyond cutie marks.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.140
Everything we do
here in the past,

11:58.410 --> 11:59.780
even the smallest change,

12:00.040 --> 12:02.900
can snowball into an avalanche
of trouble for the future.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.500
Oh. Next I suppose
you'll tell me

12:06.500 --> 12:08.190
that the fate of
all of Equestria

12:08.190 --> 12:09.640
hangs in the balance.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.120
IT DOES!

12:11.260 --> 12:13.440
Spare me your over-blown ego.

12:13.660 --> 12:16.460
No group of friends, not
even Princess Twilight's,

12:16.470 --> 12:17.620
is that important.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.700
I don't know how important
other ponies' friendships are

12:24.700 --> 12:25.400
to the future,

12:25.740 --> 12:28.160
but I can show you what the
world is like without mine.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.280
Where are we?

12:43.040 --> 12:45.800
The future. Or
rather, the present.

12:46.780 --> 12:48.120
But there's nothing here.

12:48.780 --> 12:50.580
I wish I could say
I was surprised.

12:50.980 --> 12:53.660
But every world I come back
to is worse than the last.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.540
I don't know why my friends
and I are so important

12:56.540 --> 12:58.480
to Equestria, but we are.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.060
I don't believe you!

13:01.660 --> 13:03.540
Come on, Starlight. Look around.

13:04.380 --> 13:07.480
Like I said, everything in
the past affects the future,

13:07.900 --> 13:11.400
even the tiniest act, and
what you're doing leads here.

13:12.780 --> 13:14.020
I know I can't stop you,

13:14.540 --> 13:16.800
but I thought showing you
this might change your mind.

13:17.330 --> 13:21.680
Change my mind? You don't
know anything about me.

13:21.920 --> 13:25.680
I was perfectly happy
before you and your friends

13:25.680 --> 13:27.420
ruined what I built.

13:27.860 --> 13:29.660
I don't know what happened
that led you to make

13:29.660 --> 13:31.380
your village
without cutie marks.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.300
And I'm sorry my friends
and I had to take it away.

13:35.300 --> 13:39.510
You want to know what happened
to me? I'll show you!

13:49.260 --> 13:50.180
Where are we?

13:50.720 --> 13:54.280
That map of yours is connected
to every part of Equestria

13:54.480 --> 13:56.540
and this part is my home.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.940
Sunburst and I did
everything together.

14:06.410 --> 14:09.180
In fact, I don't remember
us ever being apart...

14:09.880 --> 14:11.060
until today.

14:40.610 --> 14:43.920
And just like that,
my friend was gone.

14:44.700 --> 14:47.100
His family recognized
his magical talent

14:47.100 --> 14:50.480
and sent him off to Canterlot.
I never saw him again.

14:51.560 --> 14:52.440
Why not?

14:52.780 --> 14:57.060
Because of his cutie mark!
He got his and I didn't.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.220
He moved on and I didn't.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.960
I stayed here and never
made another friend

15:01.960 --> 15:04.260
because I was too afraid
another cutie mark

15:04.270 --> 15:05.840
would take them away too!

15:06.400 --> 15:07.440
That's ridiculous.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.900
A cutie mark can't
take your friends away.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.700
Not everypony's lucky
enough to get her cutie mark

15:12.700 --> 15:14.320
at the same time as her friends.

15:18.380 --> 15:20.740
You don't know what it's
like to lose a friend

15:20.740 --> 15:21.960
because of a cutie mark.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.550
But once I stop the
Rainboom, you will!

15:27.180 --> 15:29.500
And when I destroy this scroll,

15:29.700 --> 15:32.330
there'll be no way
for you to change it!

15:38.780 --> 15:40.140
Starlight, you're right.

15:40.470 --> 15:42.060
I don't know what
you went through,

15:42.370 --> 15:44.220
but I do know you
can't do this.

15:44.620 --> 15:47.360
I've seen where this
leads and so have you.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.320
I only saw what
you showed me.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.000
Who knows what'll
really happen?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.700
I've seen it a dozen times.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.520
Things don't turn out
well in an Equestria

15:55.520 --> 15:56.720
without my friends.

15:56.940 --> 16:00.640
Agh! What's so special
about your friends?

16:01.080 --> 16:03.580
How can a group of ponies
that are so different

16:03.800 --> 16:05.460
be so important?

16:06.180 --> 16:07.920
The differences between
me and my friends

16:07.920 --> 16:10.520
are the very things that
make our friendship strong.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.980
I thought Sunburst
and I were the same,

16:13.440 --> 16:14.700
but we turned out different

16:14.920 --> 16:16.980
and it tore our
friendship apart.

16:17.760 --> 16:20.020
So try again. Make new friends.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.260
And if something that
you can't control happens

16:22.260 --> 16:24.920
that changes things, work
through it together.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.600
That's what friendship is.

16:27.450 --> 16:29.620
And it's not just my
friendships that are important

16:29.620 --> 16:31.900
to Equestria. Everyponies' are.

16:32.260 --> 16:34.280
When yours ended,
it led us here,

16:34.560 --> 16:36.580
but just imagine all the
others that are out there

16:36.580 --> 16:38.960
waiting for you if you
just give them a chance.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.700
How do I know they won't
all end the same way?

16:42.100 --> 16:44.420
I guess it's up to you
to make sure they don't.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.240
One Castle of
Friendship. Check.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.080
What in Equestria was that?

17:27.860 --> 17:29.160
Is everypony OK?

17:29.920 --> 17:30.780
Can you do it again?

17:31.310 --> 17:33.960
One group of amazing
friends. Check.

17:34.340 --> 17:37.060
Yeah, Spike. It looks
like we're home.

17:37.620 --> 17:40.340
Uh, what's she doing here?

17:41.760 --> 17:44.280
Actually, it's kind
of a long story.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.660
I mean, I knew my
Rainboom was awesome,

17:52.660 --> 17:55.460
but I never thought all of
Equestria depended on it.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.940
Or on us!

17:57.220 --> 17:58.440
I think it's more than that.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.640
Friendship connects
all of Equestria

18:00.960 --> 18:02.540
and undoing one group
of friends

18:02.540 --> 18:04.200
made its magic
less powerful.

18:04.540 --> 18:06.380
I can't believe y'all
were able to travel

18:06.380 --> 18:07.660
through time like that.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.180
That Starlight must
be pretty magical!

18:11.650 --> 18:13.760
She obviously has
more talent for magic

18:13.760 --> 18:15.620
than almost any pony I've seen.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.480
My magic couldn't stop her.

18:17.740 --> 18:19.840
I had to convince her
to stop on her own.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.980
Once I realized that,
everything fell into place.

18:23.530 --> 18:26.340
But if she's as
powerful as all that,

18:26.700 --> 18:29.320
we can't just send her
on her way, can we?

18:29.980 --> 18:32.840
Actually, I kind of have
something else in mind.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.780
I know there's no
excuse for what I did,

18:44.240 --> 18:45.800
but I want you all to
know that I'm ready

18:45.800 --> 18:47.900
for whatever punishment
you think is fair.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.980
I've been thinking a lot about
how badly Equestria fared

18:50.980 --> 18:52.640
without just one
group of friends.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.940
Because even when
one friendship dies,

18:55.060 --> 18:56.740
the results can
be disastrous.

18:57.660 --> 19:00.320
I know, firsthoof,
how true that can be.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.440
And that's why I've
asked you here.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.140
If you're willing
to learn,

19:04.400 --> 19:06.000
I'm willing to teach
you what I know.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.346
You'll have the power
to make Equestria

19:08.340 --> 19:09.520
an even better place.

19:11.900 --> 19:12.960
How do I start?

19:13.300 --> 19:16.520
Starting is easy. All you
have to do is make a friend.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.960
And you've got seven
