WEBVTT

00:06.375 --> 00:07.396
Yeah!

00:16.234 --> 00:17.082
Who?

00:17.300 --> 00:21.102
Oh. It's you, Owloysius.
Come on! Try and keep up.

00:37.691 --> 00:39.402
Winona? I mean...

00:39.403 --> 00:40.830
Winona's head?

00:41.243 --> 00:44.462
Um... Is this weird or is it just me?

00:47.060 --> 00:49.446
Angel?! Gummy?!

00:49.447 --> 00:54.684
Okay. This is officially beyond weird now
and moved right on down to freakytown.

02:03.824 --> 02:07.401
Sincerest apologies, Rainbow,
if our pets were bothering you.

02:07.402 --> 02:09.472
Say you're sorry, Opal.

02:10.633 --> 02:11.928
She's sorry.

02:12.231 --> 02:13.984
What are you all doing out here?

02:14.037 --> 02:18.335
Why, we always round up our critters for
our regular pony pet playdate in this park.

02:18.336 --> 02:19.774
Uh... You do?

02:19.775 --> 02:21.737
Same time every week.

02:21.738 --> 02:25.871
I thought you knew.
You didn't know? She didn't know?

02:25.872 --> 02:29.827
Well, we initially planned on inviting
Rainbow, of course, except...

02:29.828 --> 02:31.730
We were totally gonna
invite you, Rainbow.

02:31.731 --> 02:33.476
Then Twilight remembered that
you don't even have a pet.

02:33.477 --> 02:35.965
And Rarity remembered that you really
like taking naps in the afternoon.

02:35.966 --> 02:38.407
So Applejack figured you wouldn't
missing out on anything anyway.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.998
And Fluttershy and I nodded
our heads in agreement like this.

02:41.697 --> 02:43.962
Oh... Please don't be mad at us.

02:44.660 --> 02:46.145
Oh... I'm not mad.

02:46.146 --> 02:49.538
You all are right. Not much point
of a pony pet playdate for me...

02:49.539 --> 02:51.541
...if I'm a pony without a pet, right?

02:51.542 --> 02:52.837
Exactly.

02:52.838 --> 02:54.605
So, if'n you'll excuse us...

03:06.581 --> 03:08.538
Hey! Now wait a minute.

03:08.539 --> 03:12.476
Just because I don't have a pet now
doesn't mean I never want a pet.

03:12.914 --> 03:16.474
Oh! Oh, really?
You really want a pet? Really?

03:16.475 --> 03:18.900
Cause I've got so many
wonderful choices at my house.

03:18.901 --> 03:20.959
Oh, and I know you'll just love them.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.440
And they'll love you! Oh!

03:22.441 --> 03:25.046
And you'll be best friends
forever and ever!

03:32.022 --> 03:36.295
<i>Now, Rainbow, my dear,
I cannot express my delight.</i>

03:36.296 --> 03:38.931
<i>It's abundantly clear
That somewhere round here</i>

03:38.932 --> 03:41.466
<i>Is the pet that will suit you just right.</i>

03:41.784 --> 03:45.742
<i>I can't wait to get started,
but first let me set a few rules.</i>

03:45.743 --> 03:48.146
<i>It's of utmost importance
the pet that I get</i>

03:48.147 --> 03:50.380
<i>Is something that's awesome and cool.</i>

03:50.649 --> 03:52.583
Awesome and cool. Got it!

03:52.584 --> 03:56.995
<i>I have so many wonderful choices,
just wait, you will see.</i>

03:56.996 --> 04:01.094
<i>I need something real fast like a bullet
to keep up with me.</i>

04:01.848 --> 04:06.493
<i>Sure! How 'bout a bunny?
They're cutesy and wootsy and quick as can be.</i>

04:06.494 --> 04:09.094
"Cutesy"? "Wootsy"?
Have you even met me?

04:09.194 --> 04:13.327
<i>Rainbow, have faith!
You see, I will bet you.</i>

04:13.328 --> 04:15.826
<i>Somewhere round here
is the pet that will get you.</i>

04:15.827 --> 04:17.663
Come on, the sky is the limit.

04:17.664 --> 04:20.052
Sky is good. I'd like it to fly.

04:20.053 --> 04:23.401
Really? Because I think this wittle puddy
tat has your name written all over it.

04:23.402 --> 04:27.308
Yes, he does! Aw, look, he likes you.

04:27.880 --> 04:28.712
Pass.

04:28.713 --> 04:32.701
<i>I have so many wonderful choices
for you to decide.</i>

04:33.215 --> 04:35.942
<i>There are otters and seals
with massive appeal...</i>

04:35.943 --> 04:37.767
Otters and seals do not fly.

04:37.768 --> 04:39.899
Maybe not, but I've seen
this particular seal...

04:39.900 --> 04:42.562
...catch ten feet of air
when he breaches the water.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.947
That's it. I'm outta here.

04:45.948 --> 04:50.356
<i>Wait! There must be a pet here,
that will fit that ticket.</i>

04:50.471 --> 04:52.937
<i>How 'bout a ladybug or a cute cricket?</i>

04:53.150 --> 04:54.736
Bigger! And cooler!

04:55.064 --> 04:56.894
Bigger. Cooler. Right.

04:57.156 --> 04:59.515
<i>I've got just the thing in that tree. Dash...</i>

04:59.516 --> 05:03.881
<i>Meet your new fabulous pet squirrelee!</i>

05:03.882 --> 05:05.384
It's just a squirrel.

05:05.385 --> 05:08.940
Not just any squirrel. A flying squirrel!

05:10.478 --> 05:13.507
Yeah... So, like I was saying...

05:13.508 --> 05:16.945
<i>Fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it.</i>

05:16.946 --> 05:20.304
<i>I need a pet to keep up with me.</i>

05:20.617 --> 05:24.147
<i>Something awesome, something flying...</i>

05:24.148 --> 05:27.580
<i>...with coolness that defies gravity!</i>

05:27.581 --> 05:29.989
I'm sensing you want
an animal that can fly.

05:29.990 --> 05:30.830
You think?

05:30.929 --> 05:35.419
<i>I have plenty of wonderful
creatures who soar in the sky.</i>

05:35.420 --> 05:38.878
<i>Like a sweet hummingbird
or a giant monarch butterfly.</i>

05:38.879 --> 05:40.454
Better. But cooler.

05:40.455 --> 05:44.830
<i>I see. How 'bout an owl?
Or a wasp, or a toucan?</i>

05:44.831 --> 05:48.254
<i>There's so many wonderful
creatures the likes of that.</i>

05:49.088 --> 05:53.581
<i>There are falcons and eagles.
They are both quite regal.</i>

05:53.704 --> 05:56.509
<i>Or perhaps what you need
is a dark and mysterious bat?</i>

05:56.510 --> 05:58.147
Now you're talking!

05:58.449 --> 06:02.017
But instead of just one standout
now that's too many.

06:02.489 --> 06:06.178
<i>So many choices
and such riches a plenty.</i>

06:06.179 --> 06:08.797
Not a bad problem to have,
if you ask me.

06:08.798 --> 06:12.107
<i>The bat would be awesome,
but the wasp I'm digging too.</i>

06:12.108 --> 06:15.212
<i>You have something
in a yellow striped bat?</i>

06:15.213 --> 06:15.985
No.

06:15.986 --> 06:19.579
<i>I've got a hot pink flamingo
Just dying to meet you.</i>

06:19.580 --> 06:22.666
<i>What to do? What to do?</i>

06:23.341 --> 06:26.771
<i>A prize! That's it!
There's really just one way...</i>

06:26.772 --> 06:30.071
<i>...to find out which animal's best.</i>

06:30.641 --> 06:34.505
<i>Hold a contest of speed,
agility and guts...</i>

06:34.506 --> 06:39.866
<i>...that will put each pet to the test!</i>

06:40.060 --> 06:41.965
<i>Don't forget style,
that should be considered.</i>

06:41.966 --> 06:43.813
<i>Then we'll know for sure
who's best of the litter.</i>

06:43.814 --> 06:46.890
<i>-The one who's as awesome as cool...
-...just like me!</i>

06:47.297 --> 06:50.969
<i>Can't settle for less, cause I'm the best,
so a contest we will see!</i>

06:50.970 --> 06:57.247
<i>Who's the number one greatest,
perfectest pet in the world for me!</i>

06:57.248 --> 07:02.843
<i>May the race begin!</i>

07:03.025 --> 07:05.216
And may the best pet win!

07:12.876 --> 07:13.992
Shh...!

07:15.029 --> 07:19.351
So, you all think you've got what
it takes to be my pet, do ya?

07:19.352 --> 07:21.948
Well, we'll just see about that.

07:23.270 --> 07:25.366
If any of you don't think
you can handle it...

07:25.695 --> 07:29.299
...bow out now before you humiliate
yourself in front of your peers.

07:30.382 --> 07:32.821
This competition isn't for the weak.

07:32.822 --> 07:35.924
You'd better be prepared
to step up your game!

07:36.689 --> 07:38.574
YOU CALL THAT FLAPPING?!

07:39.033 --> 07:40.120
That's better.

07:40.121 --> 07:42.680
There's only room on team
just for one of you...

07:42.681 --> 07:46.259
...and my future pet needs to
be able to take it to the extreme.

07:47.473 --> 07:48.619
Any questions?

07:49.278 --> 07:53.073
I got one. Does she understand
what a pet really needs?

07:53.074 --> 07:56.521
Yeah. Like care and attention.
Love and affection.

07:56.823 --> 07:59.353
Ugh! And breath mints!

08:00.380 --> 08:04.196
Now you just pay attention
and try your best and...

08:04.197 --> 08:06.593
Seriously, Fluttershy. The turtle?

08:06.594 --> 08:08.743
What did you bring that thing here for?

08:09.057 --> 08:10.826
Technically he's a tortoise.

08:10.827 --> 08:13.500
And he's always dreamed
of being somepony's pet.

08:13.501 --> 08:16.031
He just wants a chance to compete.
He won't get in the way.

08:16.032 --> 08:18.166
You won't even know he's here.

08:22.507 --> 08:23.607
No.

08:23.608 --> 08:25.959
Oh. Just let him try.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.906
But there's no way
he can possibly keep up.

08:28.907 --> 08:30.268
Look at 'im.

08:32.187 --> 08:35.091
-It won't hurt to let him try.
-But...

08:35.092 --> 08:37.543
Just let him try!

08:39.746 --> 08:41.260
Uh. Fine.

08:41.823 --> 08:43.652
But don't say I didn't warn you!

08:43.653 --> 08:45.882
This isn't a game, you know.

08:45.883 --> 08:48.945
All right. Now these games
will determine which one of you...

08:48.946 --> 08:52.078
...has the most important qualities
I'm looking for in a pet.

08:53.369 --> 08:54.275
Speed!

08:54.900 --> 08:55.714
Agility!

08:57.401 --> 08:58.551
Guts!

09:00.502 --> 09:01.823
Style!

09:02.291 --> 09:03.694
Coolness!

09:03.996 --> 09:05.412
Awesomeness!

09:05.545 --> 09:07.871
And radicalness!

09:07.872 --> 09:09.700
Aren't those all the same thing?

09:10.757 --> 09:12.457
You would think that, Twilight.

09:12.458 --> 09:15.684
And that's why you would
never qualify to be my pet.

09:17.237 --> 09:18.618
Speed!

09:18.619 --> 09:20.222
On your marks...

09:21.803 --> 09:23.184
Get set...

09:30.893 --> 09:31.907
Sorta speedy.

09:32.129 --> 09:32.802
Not speedy.

09:33.150 --> 09:34.250
Pretty speedy.

09:34.593 --> 09:35.961
Could be more speedy.

09:40.307 --> 09:42.602
Yeah! That's speed!

09:49.374 --> 09:50.979
That's just sad.

09:51.802 --> 09:53.126
Agility!

09:54.826 --> 09:56.009
Sorta agile.

09:57.771 --> 09:58.718
Not agile.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.290
Pretty agile.

10:01.528 --> 10:02.912
Could be more agile.

10:08.183 --> 10:11.747
Wanna know the opposite
of agility? That.

10:18.944 --> 10:21.828
Yeah, baby! Now that's
what I call agility!

10:23.469 --> 10:25.219
Don't leave me hangin'!

10:28.740 --> 10:31.094
I'm gonna have to shave a point
off your score for that.

10:35.653 --> 10:40.800
Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and
get Opal's favorite toy away from her?

10:59.804 --> 11:02.091
Now that takes guts!

11:10.961 --> 11:12.305
Style.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.432
Any pet of mine's gotta look good.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.623
'Cause you gotta make me look good.

11:24.190 --> 11:25.644
Coolness.

11:26.445 --> 11:27.330
Sorta cool.

11:28.175 --> 11:29.151
Not cool.

11:30.305 --> 11:31.170
Pretty cool.

11:32.231 --> 11:33.321
Could be cooler.

11:34.775 --> 11:36.154
Not what I had in mind.

11:38.755 --> 11:40.767
I can't hear you!

11:45.480 --> 11:48.225
Now that's a cool sound!

11:51.810 --> 11:52.804
Sorta awesome.

11:54.570 --> 11:55.871
Not awesome.

11:58.116 --> 11:59.826
Could be more awesome.

12:00.802 --> 12:04.662
Hohoho yeah! That is awesome!

12:06.912 --> 12:09.028
Uh... You did that already.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.034
That's pretty much all you can do, huh?

12:32.541 --> 12:33.371
Whoa...

12:33.372 --> 12:36.098
That was truly awesome!

12:36.490 --> 12:39.316
But I'm afraid this is
the radicalness competition, so...

12:39.317 --> 12:41.106
...I'm gonna have to
take some points off.

12:50.192 --> 12:51.476
Listen, turtle...

12:51.477 --> 12:53.341
-Tortoise!
-Whatever!

12:53.342 --> 12:56.104
You had your fun, but I think
you and I both know...

12:56.105 --> 12:58.249
...who made the cut and who didn't.

13:03.993 --> 13:05.401
You didn't.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.282
I mean... A for effort and everything...

13:12.283 --> 13:13.971
You gave it your best shot.

13:13.972 --> 13:16.697
Maybe I've got a gold star sticker
around here somewhere you can have.

13:16.698 --> 13:20.656
But seriously, go home.
You're starting to creep me out.

13:24.636 --> 13:27.489
So... Anyway...

13:27.490 --> 13:29.580
You're all outstanding competitors.

13:30.161 --> 13:32.934
But there can be only one of you,
who's number one.

13:33.234 --> 13:38.582
So the final, tie-breaking
contest is going to be...

13:38.583 --> 13:40.665
(Pause for dramatic effect)

13:41.325 --> 13:43.035
A race against...

13:43.094 --> 13:44.034
...ME!

13:44.391 --> 13:47.057
...through Ghastly Gorge!

13:47.058 --> 13:49.554
DUN DUN DUUUN!

13:50.507 --> 13:51.703
Gesundheit.

13:54.942 --> 13:57.583
Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary.

13:57.584 --> 13:58.664
It's fun!

13:58.882 --> 14:01.788
I've flown though it
a million times myself...

14:01.789 --> 14:04.769
...so obviously I'll be
at the front of the pack.

14:04.770 --> 14:08.376
But whichever of you make it
across the finish line with me...

14:08.377 --> 14:10.352
...will have proven
he can keep up with me...

14:10.353 --> 14:15.309
...and will have earned the honor
(and glory) of getting to be my pet.

14:15.310 --> 14:16.183
Ready?

14:17.459 --> 14:18.257
...setgo!

14:24.549 --> 14:26.153
Try to keep up!

14:42.542 --> 14:43.963
Can't catch me!

14:57.499 --> 14:59.689
♪♪♪♪♪

15:02.825 --> 15:04.265
Come on, slowpokes!

15:04.266 --> 15:06.887
You wanna win, doncha?

15:26.377 --> 15:27.887
;-P

15:36.799 --> 15:38.889
Oh! I forgot to tell you!

15:38.890 --> 15:41.258
Watch out for the quarray eels.

15:41.259 --> 15:44.386
They don't like you when
you get too close to their nests.

15:44.387 --> 15:45.740
Like this.

15:49.263 --> 15:50.849
:-O

16:04.170 --> 16:06.766
Easy-peasy, one too greasy.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.011
Right, guys?

16:17.886 --> 16:19.809
AVALANCHE!

16:21.342 --> 16:22.215
Hey!

16:35.344 --> 16:36.133
Come on...

16:36.923 --> 16:39.299
No! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me!

16:39.648 --> 16:41.564
I'm the one who's supposed to win!

16:41.565 --> 16:42.843
I don't wanna end up stuck here...

16:43.701 --> 16:44.739
...forever.

16:45.631 --> 16:48.678
Oh no. Nonono. Thi...
This can't be happening.

16:48.799 --> 16:52.104
Forever is way too long
to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge.

16:52.401 --> 16:54.046
I mean... it's like...

16:54.149 --> 16:55.211
...forever!

16:55.212 --> 16:58.994
SOMEPONY! ANYPONY! HELP ME!!!

17:13.040 --> 17:14.695
Woohoo!

17:14.696 --> 17:16.482
My prayers have been answered!

17:16.483 --> 17:18.035
Oh, thankyouthankyouthank...

17:18.361 --> 17:19.706
YOU?!

17:20.023 --> 17:21.917
Oh no!

17:21.918 --> 17:24.418
Now I'm not only gonna
be stuck here forever...

17:24.419 --> 17:28.789
...I'm gonna be stuck here forever with
the most annoying turtle in the world!

17:34.530 --> 17:37.411
I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!

18:00.370 --> 18:02.235
Something's not right here.

18:03.186 --> 18:04.799
Where's Rainbow Dash?

18:05.458 --> 18:06.845
Great gallopin' galoshes!

18:06.846 --> 18:08.640
There's been an avalanche in there!

18:08.880 --> 18:10.326
Rainbow!

18:12.309 --> 18:13.569
Wait! Look!

18:13.709 --> 18:15.029
It's the turtle!

18:15.030 --> 18:17.009
-Tortoise!
-Whatever.

18:17.010 --> 18:19.714
And he's carrying something on his back.

18:19.715 --> 18:21.842
It's Rainbow Dash!
It's her! It's Rainbow!

18:28.109 --> 18:30.383
Maybe we'd better go meet them halfway.

18:42.127 --> 18:43.865
Way to go, little guy.

18:43.866 --> 18:46.514
Oh, thank goodness
you're not hurt, Rainbow.

18:46.515 --> 18:48.379
Just my pride.

18:48.380 --> 18:52.063
I certainly hope all of this
dreadful dust was worth it...

18:53.841 --> 18:56.036
It sure was if'n it means
Rainbow gets to have...

18:56.037 --> 18:58.685
...her own little critter, just like
the rest of us, from now on.

18:59.994 --> 19:02.267
Uh... thanks.

19:02.397 --> 19:05.069
What you did... I owe you one.

19:05.685 --> 19:09.587
Rainbow! Your new pet is
over here waiting for you!

19:15.573 --> 19:19.197
Oh. Right. Yeah. That.

19:19.674 --> 19:20.821
What's the matter?

19:20.822 --> 19:22.787
You got your perfect pet, right?

19:22.788 --> 19:25.861
The best of the best,
like you wanted, remember?

19:25.862 --> 19:28.095
It can fly and it's not a squirrel.

19:28.096 --> 19:29.449
Should we sing about it again?

19:29.450 --> 19:31.903
A falcon sure looks
good on you, Rainbow.

19:36.849 --> 19:39.676
Easy, fella. Nothing to be afraid of.

19:41.301 --> 19:43.463
A falcon sure does look cool.

19:43.894 --> 19:46.985
He's absolutely everything
I wanted in a pet.

19:48.796 --> 19:49.887
Yay?

19:50.509 --> 19:54.817
But I said whoever crosses the finish
line *with me* gets to be my pet.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.777
You did! You did say that!

19:56.778 --> 19:59.303
She did say that! That was the rule!

19:59.304 --> 20:03.003
And the only racer, who crossed
the finish line with me...

20:03.004 --> 20:06.467
...was the one, who stopped
to save me when I needed help.

20:06.468 --> 20:08.024
The tortoise!

20:10.777 --> 20:12.075
But what about the...?

20:19.698 --> 20:20.912
Would you look at that.

20:20.913 --> 20:23.026
He even smiles slow.

20:26.861 --> 20:28.847
Spike, take a letter.

20:29.622 --> 20:31.529
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:31.530 --> 20:34.899
"I used to think that the most important
traits to look for in a pet..."

20:34.900 --> 20:38.355
"...or any best friend, were all
physical, competitive abilities."

20:38.886 --> 20:42.383
"But now I can see how short-sighted
and shallow that was."

20:42.844 --> 20:46.272
"Today I learned what the most
important quality really is."

20:46.273 --> 20:50.238
"A certain kind of spirit.
A stick-to-it-iveness."

20:50.239 --> 20:54.936
"A never-give-up, can-do attitude,
that's the mark of a real winner."

20:54.937 --> 20:56.846
"And this tortoise has it."

20:56.847 --> 20:58.018
Tenacity.

20:58.019 --> 20:58.989
Gesundheit.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.921
"You just can't stop that little guy."

21:00.959 --> 21:03.358
He's like a... like a...

21:03.359 --> 21:04.297
...tank!

21:05.459 --> 21:08.003
But Rainbow. You didn't want
a pet that couldn't fly...

21:08.004 --> 21:11.219
...because it would keep you grounded
and hold you back, remember?

21:21.646 --> 21:25.987
Come on, Tank! We're gonna be late
for our very first pony pet playdate!

21:32.903 --> 21:36.403
