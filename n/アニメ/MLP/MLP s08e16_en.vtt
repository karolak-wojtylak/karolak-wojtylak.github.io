00:01.868 --> 00:06.538
<i> Dear Twilight, it is difficult</i>
<i> to express how grateful I am</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:10.709
<i> to you for teaching me the</i>
<i> power of friendship.</i>

00:13.147 --> 00:16.281
<i> You would think after more</i>
<i> than a thousand years,</i>

00:16.483 --> 00:18.750
<i> there would be nothing</i>
<i> left to learn</i>

00:25.326 --> 00:31.163
<i> And yet, even a pony as old as</i>
<i> I can continue to be surprised</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.832
<i> by how much there</i>
<i> is to know.</i>

00:47.915 --> 00:50.315
"I hope you find these
postcards enjoyable

00:50.417 --> 00:52.317
and I look forward to
seeing you again,

00:52.419 --> 00:55.154
though I can't say when my
journey will be complete.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.189
Your friend, Starswirl."

01:01.562 --> 01:04.062
It must be gratifying to have
your idol writing to you

01:04.164 --> 01:06.265
about the friendship
lessons he's learning.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.167
I'm not sure I'll
ever get used to it.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.436
Of course, if he really wants
to learn about friendship,

01:11.538 --> 01:13.372
he could just come
to our school..

01:14.141 --> 01:15.407
Professor Sparkle?

01:15.609 --> 01:19.312
The Mail Pony just came
with uh, a few things.

01:21.949 --> 01:25.151
Oo! The sewing machines
I ordered for my class!

01:26.553 --> 01:27.787
These came, too.

01:27.889 --> 01:29.755
I wasn't sure what
to make of them.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.227
These machines were costly,

01:35.329 --> 01:37.129
but I am quite certain
the friendship lessons

01:37.231 --> 01:40.065
I can teach my students with
them will be invaluable.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.268
Oh don't worry, darling.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.369
I'll think of something

01:44.471 --> 01:46.371
and I didn't use school
funds to buy these.

01:46.473 --> 01:49.108
I made the purchase
entirely with my own bits.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.643
It's not that. It's this!

01:52.980 --> 01:54.780
"Why waste your time at
a friendship school

01:54.882 --> 01:56.181
that's just a school?

01:56.383 --> 02:01.220
Learn everything they teach and
more at Friendship <i>University!?</i>"

02:40.294 --> 02:42.528
Who would open
another friendship school?

02:42.830 --> 02:45.931
Oh pffft. I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.899
You're the Princess
of Friendship.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.068
What could this other
school possibly offer?

02:50.170 --> 02:54.406
It isn't just another friendship
school, it's a University!

02:54.508 --> 02:56.976
It says they teach
"the same lessons

02:57.078 --> 02:59.444
of competing schools
in half the time."

02:59.646 --> 03:01.146
That's twice the
learning!

03:01.248 --> 03:03.515
And it's in Las Pegasus?

03:03.617 --> 03:07.586
If Professor Rarity lets us skip
her sewing class -- ROAD TRIP!

03:09.456 --> 03:12.491
I think we need to
look into this school.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.862
I don't like to judge
solely on appearances,

03:16.964 --> 03:21.133
but.. what kind of
friendship school is this!?

03:21.335 --> 03:23.869
Only the best friendship
school in the West...

03:24.171 --> 03:26.405
and maybe all of Equestria!

03:38.852 --> 03:41.553
There's more ponies in here
than at our whole school.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.289
Who is running this place?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.691
[Male voice] Welcome, friends.

03:45.793 --> 03:49.428
You are about to embark on a
journey of amazing magnitude,

03:49.530 --> 03:51.864
one that will change
your lives forever.

03:51.966 --> 03:54.767
Prepare yourselves to
embrace a new path

03:54.869 --> 03:59.204
and become students of

06:07.901 --> 06:09.101
That's it, everypony!

06:09.203 --> 06:10.335
Let's hear it!

06:21.815 --> 06:22.648
Yeah!

06:24.718 --> 06:25.884
Accredited?

06:25.986 --> 06:28.220
It means officially
recognized or authorized.

06:28.322 --> 06:29.888
We know what it means.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.124
But who would
accredit this place?

06:32.226 --> 06:35.027
Why the EEA, of course!

06:36.730 --> 06:38.697
Chancellor Neighsay?

06:38.899 --> 06:42.000
The Equestria Educational
Association has taken an

06:42.102 --> 06:45.204
interest in institutions
that teach friendship

06:45.306 --> 06:47.773
in a pony-first environment.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.374
Surely you didn't
think your school

06:49.476 --> 06:51.643
has a monopoly on
the concept?

06:51.845 --> 06:54.179
Well, she did write
the book on it.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.514
Ah, yes.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.183
"How to teach
friendship to <i>creatures</i>

06:58.285 --> 07:01.920
who will one day use it as
a weapon against us."

07:02.222 --> 07:04.323
How could they use
friendship as a weapon?

07:04.425 --> 07:06.858
You tell me; it's your book.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.062
Meantime, this university
appears to be a promising option

07:10.164 --> 07:15.534
for ponies who'd prefer to stick
to the EEA book on the subject.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.236
You can't be serious.

07:17.338 --> 07:19.204
They're obviously
up to something.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.806
It's Flim and Flam!

07:21.975 --> 07:25.077
Well, that certainly
wasn't.. friendly.

07:25.679 --> 07:29.181
One would think the headmare
of a school of friendship,

07:29.283 --> 07:33.152
albeit an unaccredited one,
would behave differently.

07:33.554 --> 07:38.590
Unless she was trying to
undermine the competition? Hmm?

07:39.993 --> 07:43.028
I... No... What? I am not!

07:43.130 --> 07:45.597
I did think the Princess of
Friendship would be friendlier.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.733
Now, now fillies
and gentlecolts,

07:47.835 --> 07:51.203
let's show the Princess
just how friendly we are

07:51.305 --> 07:54.339
by signing up for
some classes!

08:01.114 --> 08:03.248
Why don't I show you around?

08:07.187 --> 08:10.122
I'm sorry, but approval from
the EEA won't convince me

08:10.224 --> 08:12.124
that this school is
what you promise.

08:12.226 --> 08:15.261
And what would it
take to convince you?

08:15.763 --> 08:18.930
Well, somepony who's
opinion I respect, for one.

08:19.132 --> 08:24.037
Really? Somepony like... this?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.040
Twilight?

08:28.242 --> 08:29.774
Uh oh.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.582
Starswirl? What are
you doing here?

08:36.984 --> 08:41.553
Why, studying friendship at Flim
and Flam's wonderful school!

08:41.655 --> 08:42.888
Oh, please..

08:42.990 --> 08:45.290
I think I know a
disguise when I see one.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.592
Take off that
ridiculous beard!

08:48.094 --> 08:49.228
FLAM!

08:51.865 --> 08:53.131
How's it going in here?

08:55.536 --> 08:58.003
Oh.. It-it's really me.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.439
I'd heard rumors
you've returned,

09:00.641 --> 09:02.641
but I didn't believe
it until now.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.410
And if a pony of your
stature is studying here,

09:05.512 --> 09:08.714
there really isn't anything
else I need to see.

09:10.451 --> 09:14.286
I, Chancellor Neighsay,
hereby confer upon Friendship

09:14.388 --> 09:19.858
University complete and
unreserved EEA accreditation!

09:22.062 --> 09:24.029
I-I don't understand.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.765
Why would you come
here and not my school?

09:26.967 --> 09:29.067
My travels brought
me to Las Pegasus.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.635
I didn't come for the school,

09:30.737 --> 09:33.772
but Flim and Flam convinced
me to try it out.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.807
Twilight: You can't
trust Flim and Flam!

09:36.009 --> 09:38.510
They tried to con the
Apples out of their farm!

09:38.612 --> 09:40.145
They sold fake health tonic!

09:40.247 --> 09:42.281
They run a resort
in Las Pegasus!

09:42.583 --> 09:46.251
Technically, our resort
is a legitimate business.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.153
I spent a thousand years

09:48.255 --> 09:50.856
thinking the worst
of a "bad" pony.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.258
You taught me to look
for the best in him.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.694
Whatever Flim and
Flam's past may be,

09:55.896 --> 09:59.332
starting this school shows they
want to change for the better.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.401
I wish I could believe that.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.636
Besides, what's untrustworthy

10:04.738 --> 10:06.738
about opening a
school of friendship?

10:06.940 --> 10:09.308
They don't even
charge for classes.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.976
I don't know.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.511
But I know they're
up to something

10:12.613 --> 10:13.664
and until I find out,

10:13.765 --> 10:17.016
I'm begging you, come
to my school instead.

10:17.618 --> 10:22.220
I understand feeling
threatened by competition.

10:22.322 --> 10:26.625
But my word, Princess, I
wonder if the ill-manners

10:26.727 --> 10:30.362
of the creatures at your
school aren't contagious.

10:30.664 --> 10:34.499
I think I will take my leave
before I become infected.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.704
Twilight, I promise I'll
visit your school soon,

10:39.906 --> 10:44.476
but for now, perhaps it's
best if you return there.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.048
You don't think they're running
an actual friendship school,

10:50.150 --> 10:51.049
do you?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.251
Darling, of course not.

10:52.353 --> 10:54.886
Which is why we
have to investigate!

10:55.388 --> 10:57.355
But we can't go poking
around the school.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.923
Everypony'll think
I'm still just

10:59.025 --> 11:00.659
"threatened by
the competition."

11:00.761 --> 11:04.730
Only if we do it
as.. <i>ourselves.</i>

11:11.471 --> 11:12.704
In these disguises,

11:12.806 --> 11:15.006
we could pass as students
at out own school.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.459
I don't know, Rarity.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.611
Ah-ah. What did I say about
using our real names?

11:22.382 --> 11:26.151
Sorry, "Plainity." But
I'm pretty sure this..

11:26.453 --> 11:28.119
isn't enough of a disguise.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.624
Hey, strangers. Are
you two new here?

11:32.826 --> 11:35.460
We sure are. Completely new!

11:35.662 --> 11:37.862
Great! See you in class!

11:39.399 --> 11:42.833
Now, I've read enough Shadow
Spade to know the key to going

11:42.936 --> 11:45.370
undercover is rehearsing
your backstory.

11:46.357 --> 11:50.341
I'm "Plainity" and I love
bland-old-normal stuff.

11:50.443 --> 11:51.876
No frills for me.

11:51.978 --> 11:54.079
OK! Heh. Your turn.

11:54.181 --> 11:57.649
[groan] My name's Eyepatch.
I have an eyepatch.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.317
Per-fect!

11:59.419 --> 12:01.654
Now, how do we start
our investigation?

12:02.456 --> 12:03.755
I think we should split up.

12:03.857 --> 12:04.923
You enroll in some classes

12:05.025 --> 12:06.892
and find out what they're
actually teaching.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.960
I'll look around and
see what I can find,

12:09.062 --> 12:11.463
assuming I'm not recognized....

12:13.133 --> 12:14.999
Welcome, newest students!

12:15.101 --> 12:16.668
Let's dive right in, shall we?

12:16.770 --> 12:18.770
One of the most important
elements of friendship

12:18.872 --> 12:21.606
is being thoughtful,
true or false?

12:24.578 --> 12:28.113
If by thoughtful you mean
generous, I'd say true.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.981
Correct! Ha hah!

12:30.083 --> 12:31.216
It was a trick question.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.084
Very impressive, Ms...?

12:33.286 --> 12:34.336
Plainity.

12:34.437 --> 12:37.087
Well, well well, Ms. Plainity,
keep it up and you'll be ready

12:37.190 --> 12:39.558
for our next level in no time!

12:42.529 --> 12:45.396
Now, let's see if you can
demonstrate for the class.

12:45.498 --> 12:49.067
What's something generous you
could do for me right now?

12:57.811 --> 13:01.212
Class, Plainity here
is now my star pupil.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.449
If any of you want a chance
at studying with Starswirl,

13:04.551 --> 13:07.652
I'd take notes on
her every action.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.727
Hello?

13:14.828 --> 13:17.762
The door is open, so I'll just
assume it's OK to come in

13:17.864 --> 13:21.233
and look around, unless
somepony says it's not.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.801
All right, then.

13:27.708 --> 13:30.842
"The Element of Laughter
and its applications."

13:30.944 --> 13:33.178
OK, that seems pretty genuine.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.648
"When to support your
friends' decisions

13:36.750 --> 13:38.183
and when to talk sense."

13:38.385 --> 13:41.320
Huh, that's actually
kind of interesting.

13:42.589 --> 13:46.157
Ah-ha! "Friendship
University's true goal

13:46.459 --> 13:49.662
is to help friends
become better friends?"

13:50.664 --> 13:52.697
Where is the proof
that it's all a scam?

13:52.899 --> 13:54.799
There isn't any...

13:57.738 --> 13:59.471
Twilight Sparkle!

13:59.673 --> 14:03.107
Did you really think an eye
patch was enough of a disguise?

14:03.209 --> 14:04.643
No, I didn't!

14:04.845 --> 14:08.012
Well then, we agree that
everypony will recognize the

14:08.114 --> 14:11.049
Princess of Friendship
in this photo of you

14:11.151 --> 14:13.485
sneaking into our office.

14:13.687 --> 14:17.656
I can see the headline
now, "Princess of Jealousy!

14:17.758 --> 14:21.326
Twilight Sparkle bent on
ruining her competition!"

14:21.428 --> 14:22.794
So sad.

14:22.896 --> 14:26.765
A news story like that
would destroy your reputation.

14:26.867 --> 14:31.870
Nopony will want to go to
your school after that.

14:36.509 --> 14:41.112
Just wait until the
papers get a hold of this.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.247
Princess Unhinged!

14:43.349 --> 14:45.283
It'll be the talk of Equestria.

14:45.785 --> 14:49.120
Well, gentleponies, I've
finished another stack.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.457
The lessons in these worksheets
are quite fascinating.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.792
Twilight? What's
going on here?

14:54.894 --> 14:58.963
Oh, just your protégé getting
caught snooping in our office

14:59.065 --> 15:02.467
in disguise! Well, sort of.

15:02.569 --> 15:07.572
Oh honestly, Princess Twilight,
envy does not look good on you.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.508
I'm not envious!

15:10.810 --> 15:12.477
I know these two
are up to something.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.546
I'm just trying
to find out what!

15:15.048 --> 15:18.116
The only pony I see who's up
to something is the pony

15:18.218 --> 15:21.686
in this picture, and it is
not the Princess I know.

15:24.257 --> 15:28.259
Well, it's about to be the
Princess all of Equestria knows.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.979
Unless...

15:30.180 --> 15:33.998
you decided to drop the whole,
"uncover the scam" thing.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.701
Then we'll rip this silly
picture up and not let it

15:36.803 --> 15:40.038
completely and utterly
ruin you and your school.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.376
You can be generous with
all sorts of things.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.779
Gifts, compliments, your time.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.251
Hey, Eyepatch!

15:53.353 --> 15:54.319
Where's your eyepatch?

15:54.421 --> 15:56.054
[gasp] Was your cover blown?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.522
You could say that.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.925
Flim and Flam took a picture of
me sneaking into their office.

16:01.027 --> 16:03.028
Were we wearing our eye patch?

16:03.830 --> 16:06.331
If I don't stop investigating,
they're going to tell everypony

16:06.433 --> 16:08.032
that I'm trying to
sabotage their school

16:08.134 --> 16:09.300
because I'm jealous.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.335
But but but...

16:10.437 --> 16:11.803
that's ridiculous!

16:11.905 --> 16:12.738
I don't know.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.072
Maybe I am just upset
that Starswirl came here

16:15.175 --> 16:16.574
instead of my school.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.077
Flim and Flam may have
turned over a new leaf.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.213
We should probably just go home.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.615
Twilight, you are not
the kind of pony

16:24.717 --> 16:26.584
to let your emotions
cloud your judgement.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.853
If you think Flim and
Flam are up to no good,

16:28.955 --> 16:29.955
you can't give up,

16:30.156 --> 16:32.756
even if their lessons
really are impressive!

16:33.359 --> 16:34.159
Wait. WHAT?

16:34.361 --> 16:36.928
Which reminds me. Can you
get a message to Spike?

16:37.030 --> 16:38.863
I want to return
those sewing machines.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.499
I need the bits if I'm going
to keep advancing here.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.468
Tuition's free, but the
worksheets sure aren't!

16:48.375 --> 16:50.975
Flim and Flam are
<i>charging</i> for these?

16:51.077 --> 16:53.111
Well, they have
to cover expenses,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.413
and Flam insists that
everything extra

16:55.515 --> 16:57.082
goes to improving
the school and...

16:57.984 --> 16:59.651
This is the scam, isn't it?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.419
Let's find out!

17:04.424 --> 17:06.624
These lessons are
so valuable.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.560
Are you sure I
can't give you more?

17:08.662 --> 17:10.561
Ah ah ah! Unnecessary!

17:10.763 --> 17:13.598
Being able to share them
with a pony like you

17:13.700 --> 17:16.200
is our real reward.

17:20.206 --> 17:25.677
Oh, my. And you want to study
alongside Starswirl, hm?

17:26.379 --> 17:27.846
It's all I have.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.788
Come back for the rest
when you can afford it.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.324
Wait! I'll sell the
shirt off my back!

17:39.426 --> 17:41.659
Aaand that's the kind of
determination that'll get you

17:41.761 --> 17:45.129
to the next level, student
whose.. name I know!

17:49.235 --> 17:51.836
Twilight, maybe I should
take over the investigation.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.338
Think of your reputation!

17:53.440 --> 17:55.840
My reputation isn't worth
much if I won't risk it

17:55.942 --> 17:57.275
for what I think is right.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.611
Besides, I have a plan.

18:20.801 --> 18:24.335
Well, brother of mine, we've got
almost all the bits we need

18:24.437 --> 18:25.804
to expand our resort.

18:25.906 --> 18:28.373
If we add another level of
classes and worksheets,

18:28.575 --> 18:29.741
we'll be there!

18:29.843 --> 18:33.044
Maybe we should add two
levels, just to be safe.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.219
Ah! It's a thing of beauty.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.453
But I was thinking,

18:42.555 --> 18:46.291
what if we added another
extreme pool slide here?

18:46.893 --> 18:49.994
Sure, as long as the pipes for
the musical chocolate fountain

18:50.096 --> 18:51.963
go through.. here.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.264
Twilight: But
shouldn't it go closer

18:53.366 --> 18:55.566
to the pudding
hot tub <i>here</i>?

18:55.668 --> 18:57.602
Fair point, but-- WHAT?

18:57.704 --> 19:00.004
I knew your school was a scam!

19:00.406 --> 19:02.040
Well, well, well.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.375
If it isn't the
Princess of Jealousy.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.445
I guess we'll be going
to the papers after all.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.647
And I suppose I'll just
lead your students

19:09.749 --> 19:13.151
into this secret room of bits
and resort expansion plans!

19:13.753 --> 19:16.487
Err.. let's not get hasty.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.424
You have something on us;
we have something on you.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.559
Let's just call it.. even.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.727
I don't think so.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.996
You can destroy my
reputation if you want,

19:25.098 --> 19:28.466
but using your students' bits to
expand your resort is wrong,

19:28.568 --> 19:30.935
even if the lessons you
teach are good ones.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.403
Of course, they're good.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.839
We copied them from <i>your</i> book.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.541
We just skipped
every other page.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.509
"All the lessons,
half the time!"

19:38.811 --> 19:41.546
Ugh. Fine. If you really
want to call it even,

19:41.648 --> 19:44.649
give back the bits and stop
charging for my lessons.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.052
Then you can teach them
as much as you like.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.855
Nah! Running a school is
more work than we thought.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.392
Besides, we almost have
everything we need.

19:54.094 --> 19:55.660
I think not!

19:55.962 --> 19:57.095
Plainity?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.130
My star pupil?

19:59.232 --> 20:01.032
Not Plainity, but...

20:01.234 --> 20:02.500
Rarity!

20:02.902 --> 20:03.535
Who?

20:03.637 --> 20:05.470
We decided to bring
somepony else here

20:05.572 --> 20:08.006
to listen to everything
you just said!

20:08.908 --> 20:13.010
[mumble] Hey! Starswirl. We
were just about to--

20:13.112 --> 20:15.012
Return the bits
you've collected from

20:15.114 --> 20:18.016
your students and
close your school?

20:18.218 --> 20:20.151
[gulp] Yeah. That.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.160
Ah, it seems I'll
never stop learning

20:29.262 --> 20:30.929
from your example,
Twilight.

20:31.131 --> 20:34.666
It is a valuable lesson to stand
up for what you know is true.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.834
I wish I had known it too.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.836
Thanks for returning our bits,

20:39.038 --> 20:42.106
but how are we going to
learn about friendship now?

20:45.045 --> 20:49.380
Well, I can refer you to a
fairly reputable establishment

20:49.482 --> 20:51.349
just outside of Ponyville.

20:51.451 --> 20:55.453
I'm quite certain the headmare
would consider letting you in.

20:58.992 --> 21:01.759
"Of course, if I ever
go to a school again,

21:01.861 --> 21:05.696
I'll make sure it's yours.
In friendship, Starswirl."

21:05.898 --> 21:07.865
I still don't understand
how Flim and Flam

21:07.967 --> 21:09.701
could have gotten
a copy of your book.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.870
Uh. I finished straightening
up in the library.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.406
Professor Rarity, I just
wanted to make sure

21:15.508 --> 21:17.408
you're definitely
keeping these.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.010
But of course, darling.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.411
If there's one thing I learned
at Friendship University,

21:21.514 --> 21:23.748
it is not to give up when
you know what's right

21:24.050 --> 21:27.485
and I know teaching friendship
through sewing is right!

21:27.687 --> 21:30.421
I just need to figure out how...
