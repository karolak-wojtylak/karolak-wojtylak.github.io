WEBVTT

00:04.090 --> 00:07.740
Whoa, whoa, whoa ahhhhhh!

00:08.300 --> 00:08.855
Agh!

00:12.370 --> 00:15.150
Well, we don't all
have magical horns.

00:15.775 --> 00:17.710
I've been meaning to
move these older books

00:17.755 --> 00:19.650
to my "reference"
section for a while.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.650
Gotta keep the new
books front and center!

00:21.980 --> 00:23.460
Thank you both for
your help.

00:23.650 --> 00:26.095
Are you kidding? After
all you've done for me?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.615
This is the least
I can do.

00:27.850 --> 00:30.110
Oh please, I haven't
done that much.

00:30.395 --> 00:33.425
Nah. You just taught me
the value of friendship.

00:33.890 --> 00:35.200
Not much at all.

00:35.705 --> 00:37.355
I may have offered
some guidance,

00:37.425 --> 00:39.985
but you are responsible
for the pony you've become.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.085
I'm proud to call you my
student AND my friend.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.305
Now, we just need to
get rid of these boxes.

00:45.475 --> 00:47.710
Spike, can you... Spike?

00:48.065 --> 00:49.165
What's that?

00:51.065 --> 00:52.390
Is it a bird?

00:52.670 --> 00:54.035
Is it a parasprite?

00:54.275 --> 00:56.685
It's... It's... INCOMING!!

01:04.705 --> 01:07.910
Oh. I usually get
letters by dragon.

01:08.095 --> 01:09.915
It IS the fastest
way to get mail.

01:14.060 --> 01:16.790
For me? Who would be
sending me a letter?

01:19.810 --> 01:22.500
It's the ponies
from my old village.

01:22.880 --> 01:23.835
Are they in danger?

01:24.005 --> 01:25.275
Are they upset with you?

01:25.485 --> 01:27.300
No. It's worse.

01:27.515 --> 01:30.610
They've invited me to the
annual sunset festival!

01:38.799 --> 01:43.790

By YayPonies
There wasn't even a muffin in that letter :/
https://yp1.yayponies.eu

02:24.670 --> 02:26.790
Uh, hey there,
everypony.

02:27.420 --> 02:31.550
Uh. Hey Starlight. What
are you doing here?

02:32.125 --> 02:36.060
I... I was invited. To
the Sunset Festival?

02:36.470 --> 02:40.175
Uh yeah. But we didn't think
you'd actually show up.

02:40.355 --> 02:43.455
You didn't think we really
wanted you here did you?

02:45.710 --> 02:49.820
But I apologized. I thought
everything was fine.

02:57.805 --> 03:00.690
PLEASE. Stop. STOP!

03:06.750 --> 03:10.680
What happened? Is
anypony there?

03:12.810 --> 03:16.500
Princess Luna? What
are you doing here?

03:16.820 --> 03:18.985
Dreams are my domain,
Starlight Glimmer.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.570
I am here because
you need me to be.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.370
Oh! It's only a dream.

03:24.925 --> 03:28.670
It may only be a dream, but
the feelings in it are real.

03:29.390 --> 03:31.820
Great. So I guess
I'm more afraid

03:31.850 --> 03:32.860
of going back
to the village

03:32.895 --> 03:35.455
than I thought.
What do I do now?

03:35.765 --> 03:37.750
I have been helped
time and time again

03:37.780 --> 03:40.020
by six very
special ponies.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.240
They helped me
overcome my past.

03:42.470 --> 03:44.730
You are fortunate to
have them as friends.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.550
I suggest you share your
concerns with them.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.905
I see much of myself in
you, Starlight Glimmer

03:52.240 --> 03:54.745
and I can tell you from
personal experience

03:54.955 --> 03:57.005
that things do
indeed get better.

04:01.645 --> 04:02.515
Huh?

04:06.155 --> 04:09.455
... and Princess Luna
said I should tell you all

04:09.510 --> 04:13.810
how I was feeling.
So, there it is.

04:14.190 --> 04:16.880
I'm afraid to go back to the
village for the celebration.

04:17.420 --> 04:21.450
But why, darling? You went back
to apologize; they accepted.

04:21.665 --> 04:23.435
Everypony has moved on!

04:23.855 --> 04:27.400
But have they? They don't really
know how much I've changed.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.245
Or even worse, maybe I
haven't changed as much

04:30.300 --> 04:31.475
as I think I have!

04:32.110 --> 04:35.555
TRUST ME. You are a totally
different pony now.

04:35.725 --> 04:37.885
I mean...you were
pretty awful!

04:38.070 --> 04:39.100
RAINBOW DASH!

04:39.315 --> 04:42.200
WHAT?! She WAS!
It's a compliment!

04:43.305 --> 04:45.065
I don't think they would
have sent the invitation

04:45.100 --> 04:46.730
if they didn't want
you to come.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.090
I'm sure they'd be
happy to see you.

04:49.365 --> 04:52.545
And getting an invitation
to a party and NOT GOING?

04:52.670 --> 04:54.905
That's like...
it's like...

04:55.420 --> 04:58.275
Well, I don't know what it's
like, but it is definitely bad.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.470
Just be honest
with them.

05:00.635 --> 05:02.870
I'm sure they'll understand
where you're comin' from.

05:03.150 --> 05:05.075
I understand how
hard this is for you.

05:05.420 --> 05:06.945
Maybe if you took
a friend along,

05:06.975 --> 05:08.285
it might
make things easier.

05:08.550 --> 05:11.460
Somepony you trust who
would look out for you.

05:17.355 --> 05:19.315
Thanks so much for
doing this, Trixie.

05:19.380 --> 05:20.900
When Twilight said I
should bring a friend,

05:20.940 --> 05:22.330
you were the first
pony I thought of.

05:22.795 --> 05:24.970
Great idea,
Princess Twilight.

05:24.995 --> 05:28.200
Asking me, Starlight's
BEST friend,

05:28.235 --> 05:30.340
to help her on this
difficult journey

05:30.460 --> 05:33.865
really shows how wise a
princess you have become.

05:34.505 --> 05:35.915
Thanks, Trixie.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.210
I was TALKING about me.

05:40.135 --> 05:41.710
The festival lasts
a whole week,

05:41.790 --> 05:43.520
but I'm sure we
won't stay that long.

05:43.805 --> 05:45.425
Oh I don't know,
Starlight,

05:45.605 --> 05:47.935
time really flies when
you're spending it

05:47.995 --> 05:50.595
with your BEST FRIEND!

05:56.495 --> 06:00.730
Bye Starlight!See
you later! Good luck!

06:04.465 --> 06:06.860
There it is! The
town where you --

06:06.950 --> 06:08.745
Magically stole
everypony's cutie mark,

06:08.790 --> 06:10.590
replaced them with equal
signs and forced them all

06:10.620 --> 06:13.220
to hide their
natural talents? Yes.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.080
I was going say
where you came from.

06:17.240 --> 06:21.110
But yours is a more...
emotionally traumatic answer.

06:22.725 --> 06:26.040
I just want to blend in. Be
just another pony in the crowd

06:26.090 --> 06:28.205
enjoying the Sunset
Festival with my friend.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.945
Sounds good to me. And if
things get weird for you,

06:31.040 --> 06:33.325
just let me know.
I've got your flank.

06:33.625 --> 06:34.860
Is that a promise?

06:35.020 --> 06:40.395
Not just a promise. A GREAT
and POWERFUL promise.

06:43.885 --> 06:46.460
Well, I couldn't ask
for more than that.

06:46.905 --> 06:49.500
If we're gonna do
this, let's do it!

06:58.960 --> 07:02.225
Ahh! STARLIGHT! YOU CAME!

07:03.720 --> 07:05.540
We were worried you
wouldn't be able to make it!

07:05.630 --> 07:07.205
Are you staying
the whole week?

07:07.405 --> 07:09.780
We have different
events planned each day!

07:10.090 --> 07:12.030
How is it living
in a castle?

07:12.170 --> 07:14.820
It is SO good
to see you.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.745
Oh yeah. These ponies
are terrifying.

07:22.105 --> 07:24.170
It's good to see
all of you too.

07:24.975 --> 07:27.170
You got here
JUST in time.

07:27.370 --> 07:29.685
We were having some debate
about these banners.

07:30.445 --> 07:33.150
Which do you think
feels more sunsety?

07:33.980 --> 07:36.635
Oh, you don't need
me to decide that.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.845
Whatever you think
is probably best.

07:39.155 --> 07:41.690
Uh well, how about
helping us with the routes

07:41.735 --> 07:44.630
for the relay races tomorrow.
Can you take a look?

07:45.060 --> 07:48.245
Oh, I shouldn't.
You all go ahead.

07:48.285 --> 07:50.020
I just want to
enjoy the festival.

07:50.230 --> 07:53.450
But you WILL be a judge for
the baking competition, right?

07:53.565 --> 07:55.950
We had a few questions
about the order of the acts

07:56.010 --> 07:57.340
for the talent show.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.835
And the unicorns have a
fireworks show planned.

07:59.905 --> 08:01.725
We could REALLY
use your help!

08:09.600 --> 08:11.045
NO!

08:14.105 --> 08:16.580
Huh?

08:17.840 --> 08:21.270
The great and powerful Trixie
would like to thank you all

08:21.305 --> 08:22.965
for being such an
amazing audience!

08:23.150 --> 08:25.345
Sadly it is time
for us to depart!

08:25.415 --> 08:27.485
Good night, fillies
and gentlefoals!

08:41.890 --> 08:44.960
Ugh. I was horrible
when I led that town.

08:45.160 --> 08:48.825
I was ready for them to not
trust me, but I wasn't ready

08:48.845 --> 08:50.585
for them to put me
in charge again!

08:50.880 --> 08:53.940
With my past, I should never
be in charge of anything.

08:54.485 --> 08:57.060
So you messed
up. Big deal.

08:59.020 --> 09:01.915
Don't you ever tell
another pony I said this,

09:02.155 --> 09:05.740
but even Trixie's made
mistakes. Ha, I know!

09:06.080 --> 09:09.950
The trick is to just move on and
pretend they never happened!

09:10.505 --> 09:13.195
I feel like that's
almost good advice.

09:19.570 --> 09:21.440
Hey! Uh, Pinkie Pie!

09:22.510 --> 09:24.600
Hey, you!

09:24.845 --> 09:28.470
So. You're probably wondering
why I'm back so soon.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.600
Where were you?

09:30.310 --> 09:33.570
I went to my old village?
For the festival?

09:33.995 --> 09:36.430
Ooo sounds fun!
How was it!

09:37.240 --> 09:38.895
It was kind of a disaster.

09:39.030 --> 09:41.245
I came back early
because I freaked out.

09:41.435 --> 09:43.780
Oooh, sounds awful! Bye!

09:46.160 --> 09:48.490
That was strange.

09:48.745 --> 09:50.765
Isn't she always strange?

09:51.110 --> 09:52.730
Yeah, but not like that.

09:53.435 --> 09:56.230
Hey! I'm back early!

09:56.375 --> 09:58.380
Ah, welcome
back.

09:58.670 --> 10:01.480
Have you two noticed Pinkie
acting a little strange?

10:01.675 --> 10:03.880
Pinkie Pie always
acts strange.

10:04.895 --> 10:05.950
Told you.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.425
Anyway, I wanted to
talk to all of you.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.580
Things didn't go the way I
thought they were going to go

10:10.595 --> 10:12.180
at the Sunset Festival.

10:12.510 --> 10:13.540
What happened?

10:13.670 --> 10:16.715
I kind of freaked out and
ran out of the village.

10:17.055 --> 10:19.055
HA HA HA!

10:19.115 --> 10:21.970
You freaked out and ran
away from a festival?

10:22.335 --> 10:26.025
Ha! That's the funniest dang
thing I've heard all day!

10:26.060 --> 10:30.325
Ha ha, Oh my! Let me guess. The
decorations were TERRIFYING!

10:30.350 --> 10:36.305
HA HA HA!

10:39.670 --> 10:43.155
Hello ponies. We need
Rarity and Applejack.

10:43.430 --> 10:46.110
Very important
friendship business.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.650
I have to say I'm really not
as impressed with your friends

10:54.690 --> 10:56.375
as the rest of
Equestria is.

10:56.980 --> 10:58.470
I need to talk
to Twilight.

11:05.830 --> 11:08.000
Twilight! Hello?

11:08.845 --> 11:11.230
What do you want?
Twilight's very busy!

11:11.465 --> 11:13.585
Spike, I really need
to speak with her.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.895
Make an appointment! She's
a princess after all.

11:19.110 --> 11:21.060
What's wrong with you?
Why are you being so--

11:21.335 --> 11:25.020
Rude? I think a certain dragon
didn't get his nap today!

11:25.605 --> 11:27.270
Yeah right. Whatever...

11:28.565 --> 11:31.330
Sorry, he's been acting
a little off all day.

11:31.455 --> 11:33.305
I think he missed a
meal or something.

11:33.430 --> 11:34.855
He's not the
only one.

11:34.935 --> 11:37.450
Everypony is acting a
little strange today.

11:38.015 --> 11:42.285
Yes. It's definitely been one
of those days. How are you?

11:42.530 --> 11:44.955
Not great actually.
You're probably wondering

11:44.980 --> 11:46.890
why I'm back from the
village so early.

11:47.545 --> 11:51.125
I didn't want to bring it up but
yeah, it did seem strange.

11:51.225 --> 11:52.230
Did it not go well?

11:52.700 --> 11:54.665
The townsponies kept
asking me things,

11:54.685 --> 11:56.935
like they expected me
to be in charge again.

11:57.130 --> 11:59.785
But being a leader is the
last thing I should ever be.

12:00.210 --> 12:04.325
So we left. Very suddenly.
In a literal puff of smoke.

12:04.895 --> 12:08.525
Wow. You should DEFINITELY
never go back to that village!

12:09.265 --> 12:09.870
What?

12:10.240 --> 12:13.230
If you were worried about what
they thought of you before,

12:13.315 --> 12:16.975
it's probably WAY worse
now. I'd cut my losses.

12:17.295 --> 12:20.455
That's surprising
advice coming from you.

12:21.070 --> 12:23.950
Trust me. I'm the
Princess of Friendship.

12:24.035 --> 12:27.585
You don't need those ponies. You
can always make more friends.

12:30.270 --> 12:32.730
Ah, speaking of friends,
if you'll excuse me.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.330
Important business to attend to!

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Cut my losses? That
can't be right.

13:06.670 --> 13:10.450
Hey! I wanted to apologize
for my behavior earlier.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.895
Party Favor? Can you hear me?

13:15.855 --> 13:19.525
I TOLD you, you can never
speak to them again!

13:21.285 --> 13:22.705
What are you all doing here?

13:23.135 --> 13:27.450
Making sure you do what I said!
I'm your teacher,aren't I?

13:27.805 --> 13:29.950
Didn't I say to
never come back here?

13:30.260 --> 13:32.535
Yes, but that's just
doesn't seem right.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.570
You aren't acting like
yourself. Something is wrong.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.030
A dream! This is
another dream!

13:43.235 --> 13:44.325
<i> Starlight Glimmer...</i>

13:44.630 --> 13:45.555
Princess Luna?

13:46.395 --> 13:47.605
<i> Starlight Glimmer!</i>

13:47.875 --> 13:49.525
Princess Luna, where are you?

13:49.765 --> 13:52.910
STARLIGHT GLIMMER!THERE IS
NO TIME! YOU MUST GET HELP!

13:53.160 --> 13:56.045
What? What are you talking
about? This is just a dream!

13:56.105 --> 13:59.715
NOT HERE! IN THE WAKING WORLD!
THEY'VE TAKEN MY SISTER AND I!

13:59.870 --> 14:01.485
IT'S WORSE THAN THE LAST TIME!

14:01.570 --> 14:03.880
YOUR DREAM CALLED TO ME AND
I WAS ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH!

14:03.970 --> 14:05.170
YOU MUST FIND HELP!

14:05.430 --> 14:07.355
What are you saying?
WHO'S taken you!

14:07.530 --> 14:09.365
BE CAREFUL WHO YOU TRUST.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.300
YOU WILL NEED ALL THE
HELP YOU CAN FIND.

14:11.380 --> 14:12.990
THE CHANGELINGS
HAVE RETURNED AND--

14:13.905 --> 14:15.275
Princess Luna!

14:20.910 --> 14:21.800
THEY'RE BACK!

14:35.355 --> 14:38.290
Trixie? Trixie, it's
Starlight! Are you awake?

14:38.720 --> 14:43.150
Of COURSE Princess Celestia,
I'd love to perform

14:43.190 --> 14:44.740
for Peanut Butter crackers.

14:45.470 --> 14:47.040
TRIXIE! WAKE UP!

14:58.420 --> 15:02.010
Starlight? What time is it?

15:02.175 --> 15:04.925
It's late. I think I figured out
what's wrong with my friends.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.300
I have a whole
list of things

15:07.335 --> 15:08.745
that are wrong
with your friends.

15:08.890 --> 15:11.000
We can go over it
in the morning.

15:11.670 --> 15:14.020
No! Trixie, we're in danger!

15:16.710 --> 15:21.330
OK fine. Aside from lack of
sleep, how are we in danger?

15:21.575 --> 15:22.595
I think the--

15:23.970 --> 15:27.310
What did you tell me never
to tell another pony?

15:27.690 --> 15:31.245
Starlight, if you woke me
up to play guessing games--

15:31.305 --> 15:32.640
After we left my village!

15:32.845 --> 15:36.575
What did you tell me to never
tell another pony you said!?

15:37.975 --> 15:40.200
That even Trixie's
made mistakes.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.885
Trixie, there's no time for
this. What did you say?

15:44.015 --> 15:48.265
That even Trixie's made
mistakes, OK? Are you happy?

15:49.040 --> 15:53.430
Yes. Sorry. I just had to make
sure you weren't one of them.

15:53.560 --> 15:54.350
One of who?

15:54.630 --> 15:55.930
A changeling.

15:56.225 --> 15:58.935
I think they've taken Princess
Celestia and Princess Luna.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.600
What? Are you sure? I
mean, what do we--

16:02.020 --> 16:03.405
We have to tell Twilight!

16:03.750 --> 16:06.775
If I'm right, then it's
too late for that.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.485
Agh!

16:29.075 --> 16:29.775
Agh!

16:34.825 --> 16:35.890
Is it ready?

16:36.050 --> 16:37.715
Just one more.

16:46.530 --> 16:47.960
QUEEN CHRYSALIS!

16:49.325 --> 16:51.925
Ugh, I can't take
any of you seriously

16:51.950 --> 16:53.070
when you look like that.

16:53.325 --> 16:54.490
Oh. Right.

17:01.555 --> 17:04.280
MUCH better. Now report.

17:04.595 --> 17:07.245
Everything here is going
according to plan.

17:07.315 --> 17:09.890
We've replaced the six
ponies and their dragon

17:09.975 --> 17:12.175
and have taken
control of the castle.

17:12.940 --> 17:15.800
Excellent. And I've
just received word

17:15.840 --> 17:18.490
that the Princesses from
Canterlot have successfully

17:18.520 --> 17:19.900
been replaced as well.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.530
We thought too small last time,

17:25.995 --> 17:28.530
ONE ponynapped
princess wasn't enough.

17:28.915 --> 17:32.645
With ALL the most beloved ponies
of Equestria taken care of,

17:32.815 --> 17:35.115
NOPONY can stop us.

18:16.555 --> 18:19.325
I can't deal with this.
I'm just a performer.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.685
This is... this is
princess level stuff.

18:21.865 --> 18:24.880
But the changeling's have all of
the princesses. We're doomed!

18:25.955 --> 18:29.825
Maybe not. Queen Chrysalis only
said they took Luna and Celestia

18:29.945 --> 18:31.565
and obviously Twilight
and the others,

18:31.800 --> 18:33.430
but maybe Cadance is still safe.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.760
Our best bet is to get
to the Crystal Empire

18:35.800 --> 18:37.855
before the changelings
do. That way we--

18:37.880 --> 18:40.235
<i> There's no help coming</i>
<i> from the Crystal Empire.</i>

18:46.235 --> 18:47.105
Thorax?

18:47.520 --> 18:48.115
Yes.

18:48.245 --> 18:50.265
Your wings look... different.

18:52.115 --> 18:53.360
I guess they do.

18:56.695 --> 18:58.895
How do I know you aren't
some other changeling

18:59.000 --> 19:00.755
pretending to be Throax?

19:01.590 --> 19:03.995
You were there when Spike
defended me to the ponies

19:04.035 --> 19:05.195
of the Crystal Empire.

19:05.695 --> 19:07.235
Princess Twilight said...

19:08.165 --> 19:11.405
As the Princess of Friendship,
I should set an example

19:11.435 --> 19:15.600
for all of Equestria, but today,
it was Spike who taught me--

19:15.640 --> 19:19.385
OK! OK. I believe you. We
don't need the whole speech.

19:21.835 --> 19:23.840
Trixie, this is Thorax.

19:23.990 --> 19:28.065
He's a reformed changeling.
He's on our side, understand?

19:30.605 --> 19:32.295
Hi, it's a pleasure to--

19:32.705 --> 19:35.690
If Starlight says you're on
our side I believe her but...

19:35.840 --> 19:38.225
maybe just stay over
there for now, OK?

19:40.335 --> 19:41.925
What did you mean
there's no help.

19:42.175 --> 19:43.950
Did the changelings
get Cadance too?

19:44.615 --> 19:48.485
They took Cadance, Shining
Armor AND Flurry Heart!

19:48.675 --> 19:51.295
Sunburst sent me here to get
Princess Twilight's help

19:51.365 --> 19:54.385
but it sounds like it's
too late for that too.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.265
So what should we do?

19:56.590 --> 19:58.760
Yeah, Starlight what
are we going to do?

19:59.885 --> 20:03.555
I... I don't know. There
has to be somepony else

20:03.585 --> 20:04.565
who can handle this.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.705
There is NOPONY else.

20:06.855 --> 20:10.145
Everypony with powerful
magic is already gone!

20:10.265 --> 20:12.715
You know, whenever ponies
talk about powerful magic,

20:12.755 --> 20:14.160
they always leave me out.

20:14.350 --> 20:17.670
If I weren't so evolved, I might
decide to take it personally.

20:18.305 --> 20:20.215
Well, isn't this
QUITE the combination

20:20.260 --> 20:21.895
of secondary characters.

20:22.945 --> 20:24.615
Where are Twilight
and the girls?

20:24.880 --> 20:28.185
First, how do we know
that you're really you?

20:35.985 --> 20:37.485
Shall I continue?

20:37.675 --> 20:39.685
Chrysalis and the
changelings are back.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.045
They've ponynapped all of
the most powerful ponies

20:42.085 --> 20:43.060
in Equestria.

20:43.155 --> 20:46.090
Celestia, Luna, Cadance,
Shining Armor, Flurry Heart,

20:46.150 --> 20:47.915
Twilight and her
friends. We need to--

20:48.940 --> 20:50.345
They took Fluttershy?

20:50.690 --> 20:51.280
Yes.

20:51.620 --> 20:52.830
Where?

20:52.980 --> 20:55.725
The changeling kingdom. With
you on our side, I think we --

20:58.635 --> 21:01.825
Odd. I was trying to take
us right to Fluttershy,

21:01.860 --> 21:04.470
but there is no Fluttershy.

21:07.570 --> 21:11.265
I think I have a pretty good
idea where she might be.

21:18.035 --> 21:22.605
Oh. I'd hoped to never see
that place again. Now what?
