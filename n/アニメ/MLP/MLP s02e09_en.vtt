WEBVTT

00:11.038 --> 00:14.294
Here? I get to stay here?

00:14.295 --> 00:17.216
Twilight Sparkle said you were
coming to Canterlot for a visit...

00:17.217 --> 00:19.135
...and asked if
I might accommodate you.

00:19.136 --> 00:21.378
Thank you so much, princess.

00:21.379 --> 00:22.689
You're very welcome.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.801
No, really. This is so nice of you.

00:25.802 --> 00:27.358
It's nothing, really.

00:27.359 --> 00:29.331
Oh, but it isn't nothing.
It's everything.

00:29.332 --> 00:31.891
I-I just don't know what to say
but thank you, thank you!

00:33.154 --> 00:36.817
Thank you... Thank you...
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

00:39.913 --> 00:41.700
-You are very welc...
-Thank you!

00:43.142 --> 00:45.293
Your luggage, mademoiselle?

00:46.250 --> 00:47.708
I'll leave you to get settled.

00:48.653 --> 00:50.075
Your highness...

00:50.076 --> 00:51.348
Enjoy your stay.

00:53.244 --> 00:54.485
Thank you!

00:55.503 --> 00:57.131
Where would you like me to put these?

01:01.347 --> 01:02.435
That's perfect.

01:43.929 --> 01:46.634
Opal, do you know what
I love about Canterlot?

01:49.305 --> 01:51.022
Everything!

01:51.023 --> 01:55.089
I may have been born in Ponyville,
but I am a Canterlot pony at heart.

01:55.999 --> 01:58.598
Now I know that we are here
to pick up some fabrics for the shop...

01:58.599 --> 02:01.255
...but Twilight was such a dear
to get me that suite at the castle...

02:01.256 --> 02:04.535
...I simply must make her something
to express my gratitude.

02:06.137 --> 02:06.922
Ooh!

02:06.923 --> 02:10.318
An outfit for her birthday party
this weekend! Perfect!

02:10.319 --> 02:12.946
Don't you just love it
here, Opalescence?

02:18.730 --> 02:20.737
Please excuse our interruption.

02:20.738 --> 02:23.995
I'm Jet Set and this
is my wife, Upper Crust.

02:23.996 --> 02:27.515
We saw you from across the café
and just have to find out...

02:27.516 --> 02:30.969
Where did you get that
simply marvelous chapeau?

02:31.804 --> 02:34.061
Huh, this old thing?
Oh, it's just something I...

02:34.062 --> 02:35.471
Rarity!

02:36.766 --> 02:37.880
Hey, Rarity!

02:41.557 --> 02:43.627
It's me! Hayseed Turnip Truck!

02:43.628 --> 02:46.177
We met at the big hoedown
in Ponyville last month.

02:46.178 --> 02:49.652
Oh... Yes... Of course. How are you?

02:49.653 --> 02:51.833
Good! Real good!

02:54.467 --> 02:57.515
You're from... Ponyville?

02:58.061 --> 02:59.475
Well, ye... yes, but...

02:59.476 --> 03:03.836
She sure is! She's a real big time
fancy pants dressmaker there.

03:03.837 --> 03:06.682
Probably made that real purty
thing she's got on her head.

03:06.683 --> 03:09.885
I thought it looked a little... country.

03:10.383 --> 03:13.760
I told you it wasn't something you
could get here in Canterlot, dear.

03:16.877 --> 03:19.586
Well, they seemed real nice.

03:25.607 --> 03:27.154
"Looked a little country."

03:28.750 --> 03:31.225
"Not something you could
get in Canterlot."

03:31.629 --> 03:34.192
I'll show you something
worthy of Canterlot!

03:40.885 --> 03:42.489
I have to get started right away.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.344
This new design is very ambitious...

03:44.345 --> 03:46.074
...and I've already written
to Twilight to let her know...

03:46.075 --> 03:48.932
...she'll have something beyond
fabulous to wear to her party.

03:56.221 --> 03:57.921
Fancypants?

03:58.592 --> 04:01.814
I say, that's one way
to make the introduction.

04:01.815 --> 04:02.828
Oh, goodness!

04:02.829 --> 04:06.909
I am so sorry. I didn't see you there.
I've just got so many bags...

04:06.910 --> 04:09.810
...and I was trying to get back
to my suite at the castle and...

04:10.041 --> 04:12.029
You're staying at the castle?

04:12.030 --> 04:15.007
Wh... The princess invited me
to stay in one of the suites.

04:15.008 --> 04:17.273
You know the princess?

04:17.297 --> 04:20.655
Hmm... A pony with
expensive taste, I see.

04:20.982 --> 04:23.673
Oh... It's for an ensemble
I'm making for a friend.

04:23.674 --> 04:25.552
Her birthday is in a few days.

04:26.371 --> 04:28.888
Again, I am really sorry
I bumped into you.

04:29.418 --> 04:30.705
I'm not.

04:31.339 --> 04:34.350
You are obviously somepony
worth bumping into.

04:35.358 --> 04:39.645
Uh, listen. I have a VIP box reserved
at the Wonderbolts Derby this afternoon.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.453
Would you... Would you be so kind...

04:41.454 --> 04:44.691
...as to join me and a few
of my companions there, hmm?

04:44.692 --> 04:45.411
Me?

04:45.412 --> 04:46.735
But of course, my dear.

04:46.736 --> 04:49.997
Well, I'm... uh... I'm not sure.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.332
We'd love to see you there, uh...

04:52.333 --> 04:53.584
Rarity.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.451
...Rarity.

05:00.001 --> 05:04.101
Pro: seeing the derby from a VIP box
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

05:04.102 --> 05:06.533
Con: going to the derby cuts
into the amount of time...

05:06.534 --> 05:08.249
...I have to finish Twilight's outfit.

05:08.250 --> 05:12.114
Pro: Fancypants is *the* most
important pony in Canterlot.

05:12.115 --> 05:14.767
His stamp of approval could
mean big things for me here.

05:14.768 --> 05:18.122
Con: Twilight's party might not be
as sophisticated as a derby...

05:18.123 --> 05:19.959
...but that doesn't mean
I shouldn't put all of my energy...

05:19.960 --> 05:21.641
...into creating her birthday ensemble.

05:21.903 --> 05:24.637
My Ponyville friends will appreciate
my hard work more than anypony.

05:26.207 --> 05:28.055
I hate to let them down.

05:30.712 --> 05:32.146
And I won't.

05:32.147 --> 05:36.310
Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts
Derby as a guest of Fancypants.

05:46.312 --> 05:48.510
Pardon me.. Excuse me... Excuse me...

05:55.675 --> 06:00.303
Rarity! Jolly good to see you!
So glad you could make it.

06:07.790 --> 06:11.178
Everypony, this is Rarity.

06:11.179 --> 06:13.883
She is staying at Canterlot Castle.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.023
Fillies and gentlecolts!

06:19.024 --> 06:21.464
Welcome to the Wonderbolts Derby!

06:21.465 --> 06:23.727
The competitors are taking their
places at the starting line...

06:23.728 --> 06:26.574
...and the race will begin momentarily.

06:26.575 --> 06:28.685
I'll be rooting for Rapidfire, of course.

06:28.686 --> 06:31.157
He's sure to take home the grand prize.

06:32.207 --> 06:34.799
I don't think he has
a chance against Fleetfoot.

06:47.790 --> 06:50.344
And it's Fleetfoot by a nose!

06:51.493 --> 06:53.151
Bravo, Rarity!

06:53.152 --> 06:56.116
I say, how did you know
Fleetfoot would be victorious?

06:56.348 --> 06:58.577
My friend Rainbow Dash
talks about her all the time.

06:58.578 --> 07:01.863
She says what Fleetfoot lacks
in size, she makes up for in speed.

07:01.864 --> 07:05.639
And who is this Rainbow Dash?

07:10.677 --> 07:12.551
Why... she's...

07:12.552 --> 07:16.009
She's the... the Wonderbolts'
trainer, of course.

07:17.078 --> 07:22.124
Staying at Canterlot Castle AND she knows
the pegasus training the Wonderbolts!

07:22.125 --> 07:25.297
I told you all this was
an important pony.

07:28.128 --> 07:32.990
Three cheers for Rarity,
my new favorite party guest.

07:32.991 --> 07:38.620
Hip hip, hurray! Hip hip, hurray!
Hip hip, hurray!

07:39.529 --> 07:42.793
...and then I said: "Please,
that isn't a hat, darling."

07:42.794 --> 07:46.495
"That's a natural disaster, that
somehow landed atop your head!"

07:49.332 --> 07:54.050
Oh, you are a delight, Rarity.
An absolute delight.

07:54.051 --> 07:57.785
You simply must attend my
art gallery opening this evening.

07:58.156 --> 08:00.434
Oh. I'd love to, but I...

08:00.435 --> 08:04.124
And let's not forget my charity
auction tomorrow morning.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.797
That sounds wonderful, but I...

08:05.798 --> 08:09.850
And of course there's a seat for you
at my dinner party tomorrow night.

08:09.851 --> 08:12.324
I'm flattered. Really.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.399
It's just I have a project I really
need to get started on and...

08:15.400 --> 08:17.400
Oh, but Rarity!

08:17.401 --> 08:21.715
I may as well close down the whole
gallery if you can't attend!

08:21.716 --> 08:25.088
My auction is for charity,
dear. For charity!

08:25.089 --> 08:28.278
And my dinner party will be
a disaster if you don't come.

08:30.717 --> 08:32.422
Of course I'll be there.

08:32.423 --> 08:35.416
-Wonderful!
-Disaster averted.

08:39.169 --> 08:42.297
Looks like we'll be spending a few
more days here, Opalescence.

08:42.298 --> 08:44.336
Turns out bumping into
Fancypants like that...

08:44.337 --> 08:46.991
...was the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

08:47.305 --> 08:48.934
Of course finishing
Twilight's dress in time...

08:48.935 --> 08:51.983
...for her birthday party
is still my top priority.

08:52.148 --> 08:54.557
But I can't possibly disappoint
the Canterlot elite...

08:54.558 --> 08:57.697
...by rejecting their
invitations, now can I?

09:05.883 --> 09:09.872
<i>I'll be the toast of the town,
the girl on the go</i>

09:09.873 --> 09:13.899
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

09:13.900 --> 09:17.836
<i>I'll be the one to watch,
the girl in the flow</i>

09:17.837 --> 09:22.005
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

09:23.056 --> 09:26.538
<i>Becoming as popular
as popular can be</i>

09:27.085 --> 09:31.149
<i>Making my mark, making my mark
in high society</i>

09:31.150 --> 09:35.778
<i>I'm the belle of the ball,
the star of the show, yeah</i>

09:35.779 --> 09:40.035
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

09:41.024 --> 09:45.037
<i>See how they hang on
every word that I speak</i>

09:45.038 --> 09:49.039
<i>My approving glance
is what they all seek</i>

09:49.040 --> 09:53.792
<i>I'm the crème de la crème,
not just another Jane Doe</i>

09:53.793 --> 10:00.160
<i>And the type of pony
everypony should know</i>

10:00.260 --> 10:04.239
<i>At home, at the opera,
on a fancy yacht</i>

10:04.240 --> 10:08.117
<i>Becoming the talk,
the talk of all of Canterlot</i>

10:08.118 --> 10:12.883
<i>I'm the crème de la crème,
not just another Jane Doe, yeah</i>

10:12.884 --> 10:20.099
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

10:24.549 --> 10:27.498
<i>Because I'm the type of pony</i>

10:27.499 --> 10:31.168
<i>Yes, I'm the type of pony</i>

10:31.169 --> 10:46.282
<i>Yes, I'm the type of pony
everypony should know</i>

10:49.301 --> 10:51.646
Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything.

10:51.647 --> 10:53.733
Me... too...

10:53.734 --> 10:56.243
We better get going.
I must get back to Ponyville...

10:56.244 --> 10:58.757
...with enough time
to finish Twilight's ensemble.

11:01.313 --> 11:02.246
For me?

11:02.535 --> 11:04.508
"Dearest Rarity, your
presence is requested..."

11:04.509 --> 11:07.565
"...at the Canterlot Garden
Party tomorrow afternoon."

11:07.566 --> 11:09.903
"Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust."

11:10.871 --> 11:12.929
The Canterlot Garden Party!

11:12.930 --> 11:16.685
Why, next to the Galloping Gala that is
*the* premier event of Canterlot!

11:17.676 --> 11:21.285
Ooh. But if I go,
I'll miss Twilight's birthday.

11:21.582 --> 11:24.321
But if I don't go, my new
reputation in Canterlot...

11:24.322 --> 11:27.507
...as a Very Important
Pony might be ruined!

11:27.508 --> 11:31.139
I might never be invited to another
high society event again!

11:31.140 --> 11:33.367
Friend's birthday – Very Important Pony...

11:36.433 --> 11:38.431
It's just too important.

11:42.203 --> 11:44.343
"My dear Twilight. I am afraid..."

11:44.344 --> 11:46.994
"...I won't be able to make it
to your birthday party tomorrow..."

11:46.995 --> 11:48.437
"...because..."

11:48.438 --> 11:51.387
Because poor Opal is quite ill!

11:51.388 --> 11:55.815
And she is in no condition to make
the long journey back to Ponyville.

11:55.816 --> 12:01.370
"I do hope you understand.
Your friend, Rarity."

12:01.371 --> 12:04.597
I suppose this means you don't
need me to bring down your bags?

12:04.598 --> 12:05.430
No.

12:05.707 --> 12:08.127
But I will need some
help unpacking them.

12:11.883 --> 12:13.566
What do you think? Too much?

12:15.352 --> 12:17.121
You're right. Too little.

12:17.962 --> 12:20.045
Garden party, here I come!

12:20.971 --> 12:22.596
SURPRISE!

12:26.656 --> 12:29.653
And SWOOSH! And right before
she hit the ground, SHOOM, she...

12:29.654 --> 12:30.574
Hi again!

12:30.877 --> 12:33.645
W-What are you...
How did you... Why are you...

12:33.646 --> 12:37.293
Listen to her. She's so excited
to see us, she can hardly talk.

12:37.294 --> 12:40.461
What I mean to say is,
what are you all doing here?

12:40.462 --> 12:43.205
When I got your letter saying
you were stuck in Canterlot...

12:43.206 --> 12:45.693
...I asked Pinkie Pie if it
wouldn't be too much trouble...

12:45.694 --> 12:48.739
...to move my birthday party here,
so you wouldn't have to miss it.

12:48.740 --> 12:50.607
Balloons are super easy to pack.

12:54.697 --> 12:58.964
Wow. First you get me a suite
at Canterlot Castle and now this...

12:58.965 --> 13:01.426
I don't know what to say, Twilight.

13:01.427 --> 13:05.533
How about you start by saying what
you're doing in that fancy getup.

13:05.903 --> 13:08.147
This? Uh.. Well, I...

13:08.340 --> 13:13.150
I always put on something a little fancy
when Opal's feeling under the weather.

13:13.151 --> 13:14.539
Cheers her right up.

13:16.174 --> 13:19.389
Oh, poor Opal.
Where is the sick darling?

13:19.390 --> 13:21.258
Oh, uh... she's...

13:21.259 --> 13:22.459
Hold on a minute.

13:26.842 --> 13:28.894
I am so sorry about this.

13:36.012 --> 13:37.925
She's resting on the bed.

13:37.926 --> 13:41.762
Poor baby. She looks awful.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.146
Is that my dress?

13:46.291 --> 13:47.631
Yes...

13:47.947 --> 13:52.003
It's so simple. So practical.

13:52.004 --> 13:53.649
So... ME!

13:53.650 --> 13:56.212
It's the perfect dress
for my birthday party!

13:56.213 --> 13:57.771
I love it!

13:59.307 --> 14:02.171
You don't know how glad
I am to hear you say that.

14:05.847 --> 14:08.703
When I told the princess that I was
moving the party to Canterlot...

14:08.704 --> 14:12.442
...she was kind enough to offer us
the Canterlot Castle ballroom.

14:13.874 --> 14:15.775
Isn't it fancy pants?

14:15.776 --> 14:17.063
Fancypants!

14:17.208 --> 14:18.334
Where?!

14:19.669 --> 14:21.306
I... mean...

14:21.307 --> 14:24.801
...where did you find the time
to put up all these decorations?

14:26.844 --> 14:30.149
Oh, I never leave home
without my party cannon!

14:32.916 --> 14:34.310
Ta-da!

14:35.184 --> 14:37.209
I thought about having
my birthday outside...

14:37.210 --> 14:40.411
...but they're having another party
on the castle grounds today.

14:48.541 --> 14:50.687
LET'S PARTY!

15:16.947 --> 15:19.250
No reason I can't at least
make an appearance.

15:29.961 --> 15:32.097
I'm here!

15:32.392 --> 15:35.073
Darling, I'm so glad you made it.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.358
Rarity! So happy to see you here.

15:38.359 --> 15:41.021
I wouldn't have missed
this for the world.

15:42.199 --> 15:44.971
I say, what is that
scent you're wearing?

15:44.972 --> 15:48.310
It smells like...
Is that cake frosting?

15:49.676 --> 15:53.098
Yes, I always dab a little frosting
behind my ears before I go out.

15:54.932 --> 15:58.070
After all, who doesn't like
the smell of cake frosting?

15:58.773 --> 16:00.444
I know I do.

16:02.434 --> 16:05.441
Well, all this talk about cake
has made me hungry.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.962
Think I'll go and see what's
on the hors d'oeuvre table.

16:07.963 --> 16:09.733
If you'll excuse me...

16:09.734 --> 16:12.584
-I must say, you do look like a...
-Oh, yes, darling.

16:49.749 --> 16:52.161
I think I left the bath water
running in my suite.

16:53.226 --> 16:55.051
I really should go check on Opal.

16:55.302 --> 16:57.297
Is that Princess Celestia?

16:57.298 --> 16:59.454
I need to use the little filly's room.

16:59.455 --> 17:01.107
Can I get anypony more punch?

17:01.108 --> 17:03.561
I... have to go to do the...

17:03.562 --> 17:05.904
...thing with the... stuff, you know.

17:05.905 --> 17:08.406
Uh... What's with the croquet mallet?

17:08.407 --> 17:11.552
-[What croquet mallet?]
-Duh! The one in your mouth.

17:14.218 --> 17:16.359
Oh, that croquet mallet.

17:16.360 --> 17:19.808
I... well, I... you know,
the truth is... the truth is...

17:19.809 --> 17:23.149
Were you at that other
party in the garden?

17:23.150 --> 17:25.902
I... I... I...

17:25.903 --> 17:28.657
Rarity, I'm surprised at you.

17:28.658 --> 17:30.571
Twilight, let me explain! I...

17:30.572 --> 17:33.309
I hadn't realized you were
such a savvy businesspony.

17:33.310 --> 17:35.592
You must understand! I...

17:35.593 --> 17:37.827
All of those ponies look so posh.

17:37.828 --> 17:40.074
And with the Grand
Galloping Gala coming up...

17:40.075 --> 17:42.907
...I bet you could totally get
some of them to buy your dresses.

17:42.908 --> 17:44.721
Very smart.

17:44.722 --> 17:48.297
Wh... wwwhyyy, yes! Uh...

17:48.298 --> 17:50.867
I didn't want you to think
I was being rude...

17:50.868 --> 17:53.508
...so that's exactly
the reason I didn't tell you.

17:53.509 --> 17:55.644
The one and only reason.

17:56.989 --> 17:59.065
Oh, well. You didn't have to do that.

17:59.066 --> 18:01.330
You should totally go
over there and mingle.

18:02.001 --> 18:06.248
Twilight, you really are the best
friend a pony could ever ask for.

18:06.703 --> 18:09.826
I don't know why I ever thought
you wouldn't understand.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.005
Understand what?

18:11.323 --> 18:12.085
Nothing!

18:12.086 --> 18:13.383
See you girls later!

18:14.387 --> 18:15.863
Hey, wait up!

18:15.864 --> 18:19.505
We're your friends. I'm sure they won't
mind if we check out the party too.

18:19.506 --> 18:23.787
Come on, you guys! Let's show 'em
how to party Ponyville style!

18:26.852 --> 18:28.993
Oh no!

18:54.070 --> 18:56.289
How come y'all aren't
doin' any gardenin'?

18:56.290 --> 18:58.694
This is a garden party, isn't it?

19:04.630 --> 19:07.514
Can you believe what
that pony is wearing?

19:07.515 --> 19:09.047
It's just so plain.

19:10.043 --> 19:10.959
Yeah...

19:12.062 --> 19:16.805
Excuse me. Might I ask where
you got you ensemble?

19:16.806 --> 19:18.804
Why, yes. Yes, you may.

19:18.805 --> 19:22.798
A very, very close friend of mine
from Ponyville made it for me.

19:26.133 --> 19:28.403
Ponyville? You don't say.

19:28.404 --> 19:30.652
I do say. Her name is...

19:30.653 --> 19:32.053
Fancypants! Come with me.

19:32.054 --> 19:34.897
I'd like to show you...
this thing that's over there.

19:34.898 --> 19:36.261
On the other side of the room.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.876
In a moment, my dear.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.527
This lovely filly from Ponyville
was just about to tell me...

19:41.528 --> 19:43.255
...who made her charming dress.

19:43.256 --> 19:46.668
That dress? Oh, come now.
Who cares? It's just a plain old...

19:46.669 --> 19:48.268
Oh, don't be so modest.

19:48.269 --> 19:50.428
This dress you made is beautiful.

19:54.790 --> 19:57.071
We all think so.

19:57.486 --> 19:59.913
You know these ponies?

20:12.880 --> 20:15.033
Yes. Yes, I do know them.

20:15.034 --> 20:18.475
They may not be as sophisticated
as some of you Canterlot ponies...

20:18.476 --> 20:21.889
...but they are my best friends
and they are without a doubt...

20:21.890 --> 20:24.689
...the most important ponies I know.

20:25.648 --> 20:28.845
"Important ponies"? These ruffians?

20:28.846 --> 20:31.226
Don't make me laugh.

20:33.130 --> 20:36.354
I, for one, find them charmingly rustic.

20:37.802 --> 20:40.734
And I think the dress you made
for your friend is lovely.

20:43.014 --> 20:44.908
I dare say every mare
in Canterlot will be wanting one.

20:45.275 --> 20:48.050
Oh, I'd like to place my order right now.

20:48.051 --> 20:50.186
I think you should get two, hmm?

20:51.244 --> 20:52.829
Uh, yes. Now then...

20:52.830 --> 20:56.184
How about you introduce me
to your friends?

20:56.426 --> 20:58.062
With pleasure.

20:59.706 --> 21:01.431
"Dear Princess Celestia."

21:01.671 --> 21:05.880
"I wanted to tell you about the important
lesson I learned during my visit."

21:05.881 --> 21:08.255
Now that I would like to hear.

21:08.256 --> 21:11.178
I learned that no matter
where you go in life...

21:11.179 --> 21:14.997
...you should never forget that you are
the product of your home and your friends.

21:14.998 --> 21:18.881
And that is something always
to be proud of, no matter what.

21:19.839 --> 21:22.748
A very valuable lesson to have learned.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.076
It certainly is...

21:24.077 --> 21:27.755
...but might I ask that
we hurry things up a bit?

21:27.831 --> 21:29.706
Oooh nooo!

21:32.913 --> 21:36.413
