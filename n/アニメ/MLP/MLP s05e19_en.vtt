00:02.500 --> 00:04.040
Five hundred and sixty-six,

00:04.820 --> 00:06.080
five hundred and sixty-seven...

00:07.280 --> 00:08.560
five hundred and sixty-eight!

00:11.300 --> 00:12.140
Phew!

00:14.120 --> 00:15.640
Look at that, Pound Cake.

00:16.440 --> 00:20.300
I am so close to breaking my
personal cupcake icing record!

00:21.280 --> 00:24.490
My goodness! I can't believe
what I'm seeing here!

00:24.800 --> 00:27.740
Pretty impressive,
if I do say so myself.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.420
Pinkie, would you mind
watching the counter

00:30.420 --> 00:31.700
while I pop to the supply room?

00:32.040 --> 00:34.360
We've just received
a very special order

00:34.620 --> 00:36.660
and the ingredients
need to be perfect.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.680
Okie-dokie-lokie.

00:38.780 --> 00:39.400
Thanks, dear!

00:47.340 --> 00:48.300
A baby?

00:49.560 --> 00:53.020
Shining Armor and Princess
Cadance are having A BABY?

00:54.780 --> 00:57.840
This is the best news ever! I
can't wait to tell Twilight!

00:58.520 --> 01:02.320
Oh, and Pinkie? Uh, it's
a Top Secret surprise!

01:04.080 --> 01:07.460
Shhhhhhhh!

01:08.880 --> 01:10.320
A Top Secret Surprise?

01:10.660 --> 01:12.980
But that means I have to keep
the exciting news...

01:14.520 --> 01:15.640
... to myself!

01:24.020 --> 01:36.000

We have muffins!

01:57.460 --> 01:59.000
Even though I
didn't technically

01:59.000 --> 02:00.500
make a Pinkie Promise
to Mrs. Cake,

02:00.700 --> 02:03.400
I can't tell Twilight
or anypony the big news.

02:03.780 --> 02:08.660
That would make me a... a...
big ole' surprise ruiner!

02:08.780 --> 02:09.580
Right, Gummy?

02:11.180 --> 02:13.190
Did you take that
from Pound Cake again?

02:13.600 --> 02:16.000
Don't you know it's wrong
to steal from a baby?

02:16.160 --> 02:17.500
What's all this
about a baby?

02:17.760 --> 02:19.840
What? Who? What? Who said
something about a baby?

02:20.620 --> 02:24.400
You did, Miss Pie. Just now.
What were you talking about?

02:41.400 --> 02:42.920
Great, everypony's here!

02:43.180 --> 02:44.360
Now I don't have
to wait any longer

02:44.360 --> 02:45.720
to tell you all
the wonderful news.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.720
Somepony special is
coming to visit Ponyville!

02:48.920 --> 02:50.740
And I need your help
getting everything ready.

02:53.680 --> 02:54.180
It's...

02:54.620 --> 02:56.900
Shining Armor and
Princess Cadance!

03:00.300 --> 03:02.420
Yes, and they're coming--

03:02.760 --> 03:03.840
Tomorrow!

03:08.200 --> 03:09.140
Yes, on the--

03:09.140 --> 03:11.020
Friendship Express rather
than the Crystal Empire train

03:11.020 --> 03:12.160
so as not to cause
too much of a scene

03:12.160 --> 03:13.240
when they skip
town to come visit?

03:14.960 --> 03:15.800
Yes.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.520
Aaaaaand?

03:18.260 --> 03:19.660
And that's it.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.130
Oh.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.740
Uh, how did you
know all that?

03:23.940 --> 03:27.060
Hehe, heh, uh... Pinkie sense?

03:30.560 --> 03:32.380
So, you said you needed
our help with something?

03:32.660 --> 03:33.260
Follow me.

03:39.860 --> 03:42.540
Sweet posters! Is
that Smash Fortune?

03:42.900 --> 03:43.880
It sure is.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.180
When Shining Armor said he
wanted to come to the castle

03:46.180 --> 03:48.180
and visit, I started
collecting things he liked

03:48.180 --> 03:49.800
when he was a colt
as a surprise.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.840
Surprise?

03:55.740 --> 03:58.360
I've been so excited that it's
been hard to keep it to myself.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.680
I have no idea what that's like.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.620
Aww, look at the
cute little ant farm.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.380
And check out all
these old comic books!

04:09.700 --> 04:11.360
Be careful; they're
mint in bag.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.120
What's this?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.220
This is Brutus Force!

04:24.540 --> 04:27.630
Shining Armor used to carry
him around like his baby.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.000
Yeah, ha ha, really cute.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.700
It is a bit juvenile
for castle decor,

04:36.080 --> 04:37.460
but it is very sweet of you.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.320
I'm sure Shining
Armor will love it.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.180
Me too. But, there's a few
more things I'd like to add

04:43.180 --> 04:43.960
before he gets here

04:44.140 --> 04:45.920
and I could really use
a hoof collecting them.

04:46.180 --> 04:48.320
Whatever you need, sugar
cube, we'll help Yeah get it.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.420
Thanks, everypony.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.120
I just can't wait till they
walk in and see everything!

04:54.360 --> 04:57.800
Totally understandable. Watching
somepony else be surprised

04:57.800 --> 05:00.180
with something is almost
better than being the one

05:00.180 --> 05:01.580
who's getting the surprise!

05:01.860 --> 05:06.120
But what if the surprise is
something so incredibly exciting

05:06.120 --> 05:07.720
that a pony can't
keep it in any longer

05:07.860 --> 05:09.680
and she has to tell the pony
who's standing next to her

05:09.680 --> 05:11.480
what it is or she might explode?

05:12.720 --> 05:14.500
I would say... no.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.880
The pony who ruins a
surprise for somepony else

05:19.320 --> 05:22.160
has to live with that
guilt... FOREVER!

05:25.640 --> 05:26.380
Gotta bounce!

05:31.220 --> 05:33.900
So, I know the bar
is set pretty high...

05:34.240 --> 05:36.280
but does anypony
else think Pinkie Pie

05:36.280 --> 05:38.120
was acting weirder than usual?

05:45.140 --> 05:47.660
Phew! That was
close! Too close.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.020
I almost spilled the beans.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.420
Beans that would be
really hard to clean up.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.220
I obviously can't be around
my friends right now...

05:54.420 --> 05:56.100
or anypony for that matter.

05:56.540 --> 06:00.380
Hmm. That's it! If
Shining Armor and Cadance

06:00.380 --> 06:02.760
are coming tomorrow, then all
I have to do is lock myself

06:02.760 --> 06:04.960
in my room away from
everypony until they arrive.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.820
Then I won't ruin anything!

06:07.100 --> 06:08.780
Oh, good. You're back.

06:09.460 --> 06:12.540
Mrs. Cake needs my help but
these deliveries can't wait.

06:12.780 --> 06:13.920
I can't thank you enough

06:13.920 --> 06:16.680
for agreeing to be my backup
delivery pony, Pinkie!

06:17.360 --> 06:18.560
I did?

06:21.140 --> 06:24.580
Maybe I should hire somepony
to be my backup delivery pony.

06:24.740 --> 06:25.640
I'll do it!

06:25.820 --> 06:26.340
Really?

06:26.640 --> 06:29.680
Sure! There's no possible way
that I could ever have anything

06:29.680 --> 06:31.220
that might interfere
with doing that task-

06:31.440 --> 06:33.920
like a gigantic,
emotionally-exhausting surprise

06:33.920 --> 06:36.320
that would make it super hard
to be around other ponies.

06:36.620 --> 06:40.700
Great! You're sure you
won't change your mind?

06:41.060 --> 06:45.140
No way. Cross my heart, hope to
fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!

06:48.020 --> 06:50.720
Oh, yeah. I
Pinkie-promised I'd do it.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.020
And I never break a
Pinkie Promise. Never!

06:54.400 --> 06:57.780
Well? Thanks again.
You're a real cake saver!

07:02.440 --> 07:05.100
Maybe it'll be a quiet day and
I can just avoid everypony.

07:32.880 --> 07:33.980
Hi, Pinkie Pie!

07:34.900 --> 07:36.260
Heard any good
gossip today?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.120
Yeah. We're bored.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.080
Please say you have
some interesting news!

07:42.260 --> 07:42.820
Nope!

07:48.020 --> 07:48.700
Oof!

07:51.400 --> 07:53.100
Fluttershy! What a surprise!

07:53.760 --> 07:55.200
I mean, not a surprise.

07:56.380 --> 07:57.920
You were in such a rush earlier!

07:58.240 --> 08:00.700
Twilight wanted me to ask you
if you would bring some snacks

08:00.700 --> 08:03.280
to the castle for Shining
Armor and Cadance's visit.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.320
Definitely. Got it! Pinkie
Promise. Yeah. Uh huh.

08:06.540 --> 08:08.860
You know, maybe
some baby carrots...

08:09.060 --> 08:10.640
Ha ha ha! What did you say?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.620
Baby carrots! They're
Shining Armor's favorite.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.300
Mine too! Baby carrots are
like big carrots but smaller,

08:17.560 --> 08:19.580
kinda like how foals are tiny
versions of their parents

08:19.580 --> 08:20.540
but smaller and cuter and...

08:21.340 --> 08:22.200
Albino squirrel!

08:22.520 --> 08:23.740
Where? Is it Albert?

08:31.360 --> 08:33.900
It's time to kick this
operation into hyper hoof.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.560
And avoid all ponies
by any means necessary.

09:15.060 --> 09:17.760
It didn't feel good ignoring
my friends like that.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.520
Maybe I can tell just one
little pony the surprise?

09:25.600 --> 09:28.880
The pony who ruins a
surprise for somepony else

09:29.320 --> 09:32.380
has to live with that
guilt... FOREVER!

09:34.260 --> 09:36.140
You're right, spooky
reflection of Rarity

09:36.140 --> 09:38.060
that I know is actually
my own imagination!

09:38.360 --> 09:39.960
I can't tell anypony at all.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.000
Then they
would tell Twilight

09:43.000 --> 09:46.460
and she wouldn't be surprised!
And it would be all my fault!

09:53.260 --> 09:57.040
Finally! I'm all aloney
on my owney.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.440
Wow, great idea.
I'm starving too!

10:07.400 --> 10:11.160
This apple is delicious.
What are you having, Gummy?

10:12.340 --> 10:13.380
Oh, no!

10:13.760 --> 10:16.000
It's the list that Twilight
helped me make yesterday

10:16.160 --> 10:18.540
so I wouldn't forget all of
my Pinkie Promises today!

10:19.660 --> 10:21.960
And I have three
more things to do.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.840
Four if you count bringing those
snacks to Twilight's castle.

10:26.940 --> 10:30.120
I've been getting liberal with
those Pinkie Promises lately.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.860
Ooo! I want a flamingo!

10:45.460 --> 10:46.700
I want a goldfish!

10:50.340 --> 10:51.200
Surprise me!

10:56.760 --> 10:58.660
Is that a baby bottle?

10:59.980 --> 11:05.130
Aaah! No! It's a...uh...puppy.
Haha. Woof woof! Haha!

11:06.340 --> 11:09.040
Are you sure? Because
it looks like a--

11:09.680 --> 11:10.360
Next!

11:12.800 --> 11:14.660
A baby pony, please.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.200
Unless, of course that
would be a royal pain.

11:18.420 --> 11:21.480
Interesting choice of
words, Featherweight.

11:21.800 --> 11:22.360
Was it?

11:22.600 --> 11:23.860
I don't know. Was it?

11:25.940 --> 11:28.260
Uh, maybe you'd better
just make me a giraffe.

11:37.220 --> 11:39.180
My! Your friends weren't kidding

11:39.180 --> 11:41.400
when they said you had a
great filing system, Pinkie.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.100
You are Ponyville's
best kept secret!

11:44.640 --> 11:45.440
No, I'm not!

11:50.440 --> 11:51.940
Speaking of secrets...

11:52.280 --> 11:54.880
have you ever known
somepony else's secret?

11:56.760 --> 11:58.160
No.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.620
A surprise that was
so big and exciting

12:02.840 --> 12:04.240
that it was all you
could think about?

12:04.760 --> 12:05.380
Nope!

12:06.540 --> 12:08.640
Oh! Me, neither!

12:11.680 --> 12:15.880
Oh, ho ho ho! That's just
what I wanted. Thanks, Pinkie.

12:16.100 --> 12:16.700
You're welcome!

12:17.000 --> 12:19.300
Oh, by the way, could
you help spread the word

12:19.300 --> 12:21.180
about the big crib
sale I'm having?

12:21.440 --> 12:24.400
"Treat your foal like royalty"?

12:25.280 --> 12:26.760
Ha ha ha ha.

12:27.020 --> 12:30.360
Pretty good slogan, huh? I
came up with it all by myself!

12:35.040 --> 12:36.740
Well, I thought it was clever.

12:48.460 --> 12:51.220
Those look yummy,
Pinkie! Let me help you.

12:52.260 --> 12:54.420
But we'd better cover them
up so they don't get spoiled.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.920
Why would they
get spoiled?

12:56.120 --> 12:57.720
We're all going to
eat them super soon.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.380
Oh, didn't
anypony tell ya?

12:59.600 --> 13:01.120
Shinin' Armor and
Cadance are held up.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.860
They might not arrive
until Saturday.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.340
WHAT?

13:10.160 --> 13:14.920
You mean... I have... to
wait... another whole day?

13:15.220 --> 13:16.760
I don't know if I can!

13:17.720 --> 13:20.240
Pinkie Pie, do you have
something you need to say?

13:20.600 --> 13:22.540
You seem like you've been
keeping something in.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.440
Aaaahhhh!

13:26.340 --> 13:27.640
We're here to listen.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.900
Well, go on then, sugar cube.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.160
We're not going to
judge you, darling.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.560
You'll feel so much better once
you get it off your chest!

13:41.100 --> 13:46.260
Come on. Whatever it is. You
can tell us. We're best friends!

13:47.620 --> 13:54.660
Friends, friends,
friends. Tell, tell, tell.

13:55.060 --> 14:01.900
Friends, friends,
friends. Tell, tell, tell.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.800
OK! OK! You win!

14:06.680 --> 14:08.380
SHINING ARMOR AND CADANCE
ARE GOING TO HAVE A--

14:08.380 --> 14:10.880
... an awesome weekend
with the best little sister

14:10.880 --> 14:12.820
in all of Equestria!

14:14.720 --> 14:15.880
Hi, everypony.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.720
Shining Armor!
Cadance! You're early!

14:25.020 --> 14:26.180
I thought something had come up

14:26.180 --> 14:27.860
and you weren't going to
make it until Saturday!

14:28.160 --> 14:31.340
So did we. Turned out we
weren't needed in Maretonia

14:31.340 --> 14:32.300
until next week.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.780
And the summit we were
supposed to attend today

14:34.780 --> 14:36.420
had to be
rescheduled so...

14:36.880 --> 14:38.960
we got here even
sooner than planned.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.300
Surprise!

14:41.640 --> 14:43.660
It's wonderful to
see you all again.

14:47.800 --> 14:51.060
I'm so glad you're here. I
have a big surprise for you!

14:51.380 --> 14:52.320
Oh, yeah?

15:03.080 --> 15:04.540
Lucky we came
when we did, huh?

15:04.980 --> 15:07.740
I'm guessing you saw the scroll
we sent to Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.220
Hey, I'm impressed you've been
able to keep our secret this long.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.940
So you're gonna
tell Twilight now?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.820
You're going to have to wait
just a little bit longer.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.420
We have something
special planned.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.580
It'll be worth it, I promise.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.900
It'd better be.

15:31.440 --> 15:34.000
So do ya think Shining
Armor liked his surprise?

15:34.140 --> 15:36.780
Didn't you see him? He
couldn't stop raving about it!

15:45.240 --> 15:47.600
Where did Shining Armor and
Cadance say they'd meet us?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.360
I'm starving.

15:49.540 --> 15:50.460
In the town square.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.540
I wish they'd waited
to walk over with us,

15:52.720 --> 15:54.920
but they said they had something
to take care of first.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.200
They're going to have a lot
more to take care of soon.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.220
What?

15:59.400 --> 16:00.260
Nothing!

16:05.480 --> 16:08.340
That's odd. Usually
they're quite punctual.

16:08.660 --> 16:13.080
Ughhh, I need a hayburger
in my belly right now.

16:13.860 --> 16:14.760
What's this?

16:18.600 --> 16:19.440
What does it say?

16:19.680 --> 16:22.600
A scavenger hunt! Shining Armor
used to set these up for me

16:22.600 --> 16:23.480
when I was a filly.

16:24.260 --> 16:27.300
At the end, there was always
a big prize like a new book,

16:27.520 --> 16:28.940
or several new books, or--

16:28.940 --> 16:30.800
We get the picture!
You like books!

16:32.320 --> 16:33.400
So what's the first clue?

16:33.800 --> 16:36.380
I hope it's something
about eating lunch.

16:36.700 --> 16:38.040
"You've got a scroll,
you're on a roll.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.220
Why don't you take a peek, where
young ones spend their week?

16:40.220 --> 16:42.040
A piece of paper will
continue this caper."

16:44.740 --> 16:45.720
I've got it!

16:45.980 --> 16:47.760
"Where the young ones
spend their week!"

16:48.760 --> 16:50.380
I'm not quite followin'...

16:52.400 --> 16:54.180
It's the Ponyville Schoolhouse!

16:54.880 --> 16:57.040
Good enough for me! Now
where's the next clue?

17:02.180 --> 17:02.780
Ah-choo!

17:04.000 --> 17:08.440
EXTRA! EXTRA! Get your Ponyville
News! Read it in the paper!

17:08.800 --> 17:10.040
EXTRA! EXTRA!

17:10.040 --> 17:12.660
"A piece of paper, will
continue this caper".

17:13.400 --> 17:14.740
It's in the Foal Free Press!

17:20.540 --> 17:23.820
Ooh! Look at that dress
Mayor Mare is wearing

17:23.820 --> 17:26.680
in the social report.
Why, it's stunning!

17:26.980 --> 17:29.100
Uh, didn't you make
that, Rarity?

17:29.520 --> 17:30.920
Yes. What is your point?

17:31.120 --> 17:32.600
FOCUS, EVERYPONY!

17:33.180 --> 17:35.180
You know, there's
really no time limit

17:35.180 --> 17:36.740
on these scavenger
hunts, Pinkie.

17:37.060 --> 17:38.440
AHA! There!

17:40.300 --> 17:42.220
"Though this hall
is rather small,

17:42.380 --> 17:44.440
in it you'll find
files of all kinds.

17:44.740 --> 17:47.960
Take a look on the back, of the
birth certificate of Applejack!"

17:49.660 --> 17:51.340
I don't like where
this is goin'.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.000
Baby! A ROYAL BAA---

18:11.360 --> 18:12.540
Ahem!

18:13.060 --> 18:15.240
Does anypony know where the
birth certificates are kept?

18:15.460 --> 18:18.560
Ooo! I do! I do! Go down that
hall, then you take a left,

18:18.560 --> 18:20.320
and then a right, then another
right, then a slight left,

18:20.320 --> 18:21.580
then it's the third
door from the right.

18:21.960 --> 18:25.240
Wow, Pinkie. I never knew you
knew so much about Town Hall.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.640
There's a lot of
things I know...

18:27.940 --> 18:29.500
that you don't know I know!

18:37.720 --> 18:38.700
Oh, you're so cute!

18:42.260 --> 18:45.660
"This next place is where,
you can buy a table or chair.

18:46.140 --> 18:49.600
Or some comfy beds to
rest little heads."

18:52.860 --> 18:54.800
Gah! Really? None of you?

18:55.160 --> 18:59.600
It's obviously the furniture
store! Go in, go in, go in!

19:00.460 --> 19:01.360
I don't know...

19:01.620 --> 19:03.060
AHHHH! Fine.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.480
Wow. You're scary good
at this, Pinkie Pie.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.700
"It seems we've saved
the best for last,

19:16.700 --> 19:17.820
we hope that you
have had a blast.

19:17.820 --> 19:18.760
Now it's time to take a break,

19:18.760 --> 19:19.900
where you can get
a slice of cake!"

19:20.260 --> 19:22.000
Sugarcube Corner!

19:22.940 --> 19:24.100
That was an easy one.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.460
Surprise! Twily! Did you
like the scavenger hunt?

19:32.860 --> 19:33.940
It was perfect.

19:34.120 --> 19:37.100
Just like old times, except
even better because this time

19:37.100 --> 19:38.940
I got to share it
with my best friends.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.500
There's just one thing
missing, isn't there?

19:43.780 --> 19:44.380
What's that?

19:45.100 --> 19:46.760
The book prize at the end!

19:48.220 --> 19:49.480
There's still a prize.

19:49.860 --> 19:51.540
But it's a little
different this time.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.300
Oh. I don't understand.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.180
Hee hee hee.

19:55.740 --> 19:59.140
All the places we sent you
today had something in common.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.360
First we went to
the schoolhouse...

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
...and then we read
the Foal Free Press.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.860
After that we found Applejack's
birth certificate...

20:12.400 --> 20:14.500
...and then the last
clue was under a crib...

20:15.300 --> 20:21.940
Hmm. School, foal, birth
certificate, and crib...

20:25.620 --> 20:27.280
Can it be? Are you two...

20:28.420 --> 20:30.760
WE'RE HAVING A BABY!

20:33.040 --> 20:38.240
A baby, Twilight!
It's a baby! Woo hoo!

20:39.200 --> 20:42.020
You mean... I'm
going to be an aunt?

20:45.940 --> 20:48.380
This is the best prize ever!

20:52.660 --> 20:54.440
Ooh, I love you guys.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.180
And I can't wait to
meet your little foal!

20:57.500 --> 20:58.700
Neither can we.

21:02.780 --> 21:05.260
I DID IT! I DID IT!
I DID IT! I DID IT!

21:07.760 --> 21:08.460
Go, Pinkie.

21:18.100 --> 21:21.100
You did it, Pinkie Pie!
You kept it a surprise.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.920
Thank you. Was it much trouble?

21:24.340 --> 21:25.340
Piece o' cake!
