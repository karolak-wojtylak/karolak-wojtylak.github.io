00:01.660 --> 00:03.350
Lunch time!

00:03.750 --> 00:05.250
Who's hungry?

00:05.850 --> 00:07.951
Plenty for everypony.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.214
Slow down, sweetie.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.860
Here you go, Angel bunny.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.631
Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win.

00:32.056 --> 00:34.638
Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum yum yum!

00:35.681 --> 00:37.043
What? But--

00:41.767 --> 00:43.910
Then, what will you eat?

00:47.955 --> 00:50.445
I'm not sure I can even make that.

00:51.076 --> 00:54.500
Well, I don't want you to starve...

00:55.231 --> 00:57.913
Are you sure I can't tempt you
with a nice crisp piece of--

00:59.712 --> 01:01.909
I'll make your special recipe.

01:41.526 --> 01:43.950
Hmm, let's see.
Asparagus.

01:49.746 --> 01:53.065
Excuse me... I think you just
stepped in front of me...?

01:53.779 --> 01:56.246
Excuse me, I think you made a mistake?

01:56.296 --> 01:57.247
You see I was actually here first and--

01:57.648 --> 01:59.136
Sorry, didn't notice you there.

01:59.775 --> 02:01.155
I know.

02:03.092 --> 02:04.267
Pardon me, sir.

02:04.426 --> 02:06.042
Yes, what?

02:06.186 --> 02:08.253
I think you just cut in front of me.

02:08.404 --> 02:12.190
A cut of celery?
But, this is the asparagus stand!

02:12.446 --> 02:16.086
I said, I think you just cut
in front of me.

02:16.236 --> 02:19.773
No need, dearie, I'm already in front!

02:20.426 --> 02:21.853
I noticed.

02:22.606 --> 02:23.392
Hey!

02:23.526 --> 02:26.134
Would you mind moving back?
You're in my personal space.

02:28.146 --> 02:28.575
But--

02:28.726 --> 02:30.833
Seriously, do you need
your asparagus so badly?

02:30.984 --> 02:31.876
Get a life.

02:32.598 --> 02:35.197
Oh, okay. There's no rush.

02:35.756 --> 02:36.756
Fluttershy!

02:36.907 --> 02:39.276
You mustn't let them treat you that way.

02:39.601 --> 02:41.626
It's really no big deal...

02:41.827 --> 02:44.227
It's bigger than big, it's double big.

02:44.378 --> 02:46.476
You are a pony with a problem.

02:46.626 --> 02:47.777
What problem?

02:52.866 --> 02:55.045
Go right ahead Pinkie Pie, you first.

02:55.196 --> 02:57.398
Right there! That's the problem.

02:57.549 --> 02:59.816
You've got to stop being such a doormat.

03:00.167 --> 03:01.525
A doormat?

03:01.676 --> 03:03.905
A pushover, darling.

03:04.056 --> 03:05.879
You've got to stand up for yourself.

03:06.026 --> 03:06.780
Promise us.

03:06.931 --> 03:09.286
Okay. I promise.

03:09.426 --> 03:10.487
Oh, good!

03:12.796 --> 03:14.430
That's okay, I don't mind.

03:14.581 --> 03:16.262
Watch and learn.

03:16.453 --> 03:17.186
Hold it right there,

03:17.287 --> 03:18.994
mister small and handsome!

03:19.595 --> 03:20.996
Who, me?

03:21.137 --> 03:22.634
Of course, you.

03:22.785 --> 03:25.526
Nopony ever called you handsome before?

03:26.279 --> 03:27.590
That'd be a big no.

03:28.091 --> 03:29.905
Well they should!

03:30.046 --> 03:32.807
How about flexing
some of your muscles for me?

03:35.627 --> 03:36.702
Oh my heavens!

03:36.853 --> 03:40.614
Do you think a strong, handsome stallion
such as yourself

03:40.765 --> 03:42.936
could give my friend the last asparagus?

03:46.576 --> 03:48.531
See, that's not so hard, is it?

03:49.526 --> 03:50.955
I guess not...

03:51.106 --> 03:53.653
Alright then! What else is on your list?

03:54.185 --> 03:56.683
Let's see... I also need tomatoes.

03:59.098 --> 04:00.196
Here you go.

04:01.846 --> 04:04.434
That'll be two bits. Not one.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.565
But last week it was only one bit.

04:06.716 --> 04:08.206
That was then, this is now.

04:08.524 --> 04:09.479
Okay.

04:09.696 --> 04:11.315
I don't wanna argue about it.

04:11.466 --> 04:13.023
What do you think you're doing?

04:13.144 --> 04:15.744
Mindin' my own business,
maybe you should try it.

04:15.895 --> 04:17.556
Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous.

04:17.707 --> 04:19.459
One bit is the right price.

04:19.610 --> 04:21.382
I say it's two bits.

04:22.626 --> 04:23.421
One bit.

04:24.133 --> 04:24.920
Two bits!

04:25.071 --> 04:25.921
One bit!

04:26.062 --> 04:27.743
- Two bits!
- One bit!

04:27.894 --> 04:28.744
Two bits!

04:28.895 --> 04:30.520
- Two bits!
- One bit!

04:30.661 --> 04:31.921
- Two bits!
- One bit!

04:32.062 --> 04:34.076
I insist, it's two bits or nothing!

04:34.226 --> 04:36.079
One bit and that's my final offer!

04:36.730 --> 04:38.486
Have it your way, one bit it is!

04:41.159 --> 04:43.588
See? Asserting yourself can be fun!

04:43.729 --> 04:45.139
I guess you're right!

04:45.290 --> 04:48.129
So, Fluttershy,
do you feel like giving it a try?

04:48.280 --> 04:49.962
Um... okay.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.786
I need that cherry.

04:54.863 --> 04:56.576
Am I glad you have one cherry left.

04:56.727 --> 04:59.145
You see, I'm making this special meal
for my bunny Angel

04:59.296 --> 05:02.464
he's a very picky eater,
and the recipe calls for a cherry on top.

05:03.534 --> 05:04.454
Here you go.

05:04.585 --> 05:05.728
So,

05:05.879 --> 05:08.580
you say you need
this cherry very badly.

05:08.731 --> 05:10.949
Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it!

05:11.080 --> 05:12.476
Then it'll be ten bits!

05:12.676 --> 05:13.777
Ten?!

05:17.663 --> 05:19.828
Oh, hey, mister handsome.

05:19.979 --> 05:23.956
I know you wanna do the right thing,
because you're handsome and strong

05:24.106 --> 05:27.069
and big, handsome, strong guys
are always nice to everypony, right?

05:29.543 --> 05:31.056
Ten bits for the cherry.

05:33.216 --> 05:35.256
Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous!

05:35.407 --> 05:38.426
I insist on paying you... eleven bits!

05:38.577 --> 05:39.477
Eleven bits?

05:40.026 --> 05:41.206
I mean, nine bits!

05:41.356 --> 05:42.636
Now wait a minute...

05:42.787 --> 05:45.479
Okay, twelve bits,
but that's my final offer!

05:45.626 --> 05:47.076
I think you're confused.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.238
It's twelve bits, take it or leave it.

05:49.389 --> 05:50.590
Okay, I'll take it.

05:50.947 --> 05:52.076
Don't give him your money!

05:52.226 --> 05:54.373
One cherry is not worth twelve bits!

05:54.524 --> 05:56.966
But... I was only doing what you did.

05:57.117 --> 05:59.606
It was a valiant effort,
but you should refuse to give him

05:59.756 --> 06:01.376
your business and just walk away.

06:01.506 --> 06:03.696
But... I can't let Angel starve!

06:03.826 --> 06:06.426
He won't eat it unless
I make it just right!

06:06.556 --> 06:09.086
I need that cherry
no matter what it costs!

06:09.346 --> 06:11.526
In that case, twenty bits!

06:11.656 --> 06:15.546
Twenty?!
Oh, but I don't have that much.

06:15.697 --> 06:17.376
Then why're you wasting my time?

06:17.526 --> 06:19.166
I'll give you two bits for that cherry!

06:19.316 --> 06:19.867
Sold!

06:20.026 --> 06:23.226
That's a break, kid.
Next time, don't be such a doormat.

06:31.626 --> 06:33.005
Here you go, Angel.

06:33.156 --> 06:34.976
Sorry there's no cherry on top,

06:35.126 --> 06:37.376
but the rest of it is exactly
what you wanted.

06:39.503 --> 06:40.249
Angel?

06:43.806 --> 06:47.476
Look at me... I really am a doormat.

06:48.736 --> 06:50.596
The incredible Iron Will

06:50.746 --> 06:53.145
turns doormats into dynamos.

06:53.296 --> 06:56.155
Assertiveness seminar today,
hedge maze centre.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.101
As Celestia is my witness,

07:00.256 --> 07:03.230
I'm never gonna be a pushover again!

07:20.148 --> 07:20.888
Excuse me!

07:50.008 --> 07:52.988
Welcome, friends! My name is Iron Will.

07:53.138 --> 07:56.306
And today is the first day
of your new life!

07:56.447 --> 08:00.134
I wanna hear you stomp
if you're tired of being a pushover!

08:03.638 --> 08:06.688
Stomp if you're tired of being a doormat!

08:08.848 --> 08:12.059
Stomp if you wanna pay nothing
for this seminar!

08:20.373 --> 08:22.220
That's no joke, friends.

08:22.378 --> 08:27.338
Iron Will is so confident that you will be
one hundred percent satisfied

08:27.488 --> 08:29.822
with Iron Will's assertiveness techniques,

08:29.973 --> 08:35.140
that if you are not one hundred percent
satisfied, you... pay... nothing.

08:35.288 --> 08:38.738
But I pity the fool who doubts
Iron Will's methods.

08:38.888 --> 08:40.339
You don't doubt me, do you?

08:40.908 --> 08:42.668
Uh-uh, no sir...

08:42.819 --> 08:45.234
That, my friends, is your first lesson.

08:45.368 --> 08:48.068
"Don't be shy, look 'em in the eye."

08:51.208 --> 08:52.609
Now, to demonstrate that

08:52.742 --> 08:55.284
Iron Will's techniques
will work for anypony,

08:55.445 --> 08:57.488
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

09:06.718 --> 09:08.428
You, in the back row!

09:10.453 --> 09:11.621
Who, me?

09:11.772 --> 09:15.458
Yes, you! Iron Will wants you onstage!

09:16.206 --> 09:17.648
Uh, well...

09:17.788 --> 09:19.048
Now!

09:19.208 --> 09:20.449
Okay...

09:29.088 --> 09:31.310
What are you gonna do about it?

09:31.458 --> 09:33.452
Um, politely walk around him?

09:33.538 --> 09:34.483
No.

09:34.618 --> 09:36.291
Gingerly tip-toe around him?

09:36.422 --> 09:37.288
No.

09:37.419 --> 09:38.829
Go back home, and try again tomorrow?

09:38.970 --> 09:39.830
No!

09:39.971 --> 09:44.179
"When somepony tries to block,
show them that you rock!"

09:47.868 --> 09:48.936
Oh! Sorry.

09:51.188 --> 09:54.638
"Never apologize, when you can criticize."

09:57.888 --> 09:59.251
Now, you try.

10:03.199 --> 10:06.868
Next time, get out of the way before...
I bump into you.

10:14.168 --> 10:15.664
You see my friends!?

10:15.788 --> 10:18.338
If my techniques can work
for this shy, little pony,

10:18.468 --> 10:21.525
then they can work for anypony!

10:27.735 --> 10:29.688
Okay, I feel good.

10:29.818 --> 10:31.538
I feel ready to "attack the day",

10:31.688 --> 10:32.882
as Iron Will says.

10:37.238 --> 10:39.108
Excuse me, Mr. Greenhooves,

10:39.259 --> 10:42.701
but I think you might be
over-watering my petunias...

10:42.802 --> 10:43.902
again...

10:44.043 --> 10:46.285
Let the professional handle it.

10:50.725 --> 10:54.064
"Treat me like a pushover,
and you'll get the once over."

11:04.260 --> 11:06.893
Perhaps that is enough water.

11:07.044 --> 11:07.994
Thank you.

11:10.792 --> 11:12.504
I can't believe it worked!

11:13.258 --> 11:15.238
Showpony business is tough.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.014
Go ahead, try one of your jokes out on me.

11:18.165 --> 11:19.315
I laugh at everything.

11:19.466 --> 11:20.316
Okay, okay, okay.

11:20.467 --> 11:24.316
A donkey and a mule
are stuck on a desert island...

11:25.088 --> 11:26.208
Excuse me?

11:26.359 --> 11:28.438
Would you mind moving your carts,
so I can pass?

11:28.588 --> 11:30.908
Yeah yeah, in a minute,
I just wanna finish up this story.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.594
And so the donkey says to the mule--

11:34.768 --> 11:37.148
Can you move, you're blocking my path.

11:37.288 --> 11:40.146
Yeah yeah, in a minute!
So the donkey says to the mule...

11:40.088 --> 11:43.718
"When somepony tries to block,
show them that you rock!"

11:49.580 --> 11:52.138
Easy does it, lady. We're moving, okay?

11:52.408 --> 11:53.339
Good!

11:57.280 --> 11:59.339
Who's next, please, and what

11:59.488 --> 12:00.740
can I get for you today?

12:02.282 --> 12:03.667
What do you think you're doing?

12:03.818 --> 12:04.868
Didn't you see me?

12:04.999 --> 12:06.608
Uh, I guess maybe.

12:06.759 --> 12:09.482
"Maybe"?
"Maybes are for babies!"

12:10.743 --> 12:12.568
Now go to the back of the line,

12:12.688 --> 12:14.128
where you belong!

12:21.060 --> 12:23.439
Hey, look at you!

12:24.349 --> 12:26.369
Your attitude is so feisty.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.770
It's fabulous.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.012
Looks like that monster's workshop
really paid off!

12:30.168 --> 12:32.894
Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.922
And a true inspiration.

12:35.043 --> 12:36.442
His techniques really work.

12:36.648 --> 12:39.703
Well, they've certainly made a difference
in the way you carry yourself.

12:39.854 --> 12:42.273
You truly are a whole new Fluttershy.

12:42.404 --> 12:45.188
Yes, I am.
And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked

12:45.359 --> 12:47.042
about new Fluttershy.

12:47.187 --> 12:49.966
Well, old Pinkie Pie feels
really proud of new Fluttershy.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.109
Proud as pink punch.

12:52.827 --> 12:53.854
Want some?

12:57.211 --> 13:00.818
"You laugh at me, I wrath at you!"

13:05.208 --> 13:06.383
Bye, girls.

13:07.731 --> 13:09.004
What a day.

13:09.819 --> 13:10.558
Taxi!

13:15.218 --> 13:16.396
Oh no you don't.

13:16.547 --> 13:18.886
"Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!"

13:23.767 --> 13:26.335
Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around!

13:26.487 --> 13:28.487
NOPONY!

13:30.170 --> 13:31.993
Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure

13:32.124 --> 13:35.102
new Fluttershy is such
a good idea after all.

13:35.238 --> 13:36.987
Old Rarity agrees.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.592
You got this, new Fluttershy!

13:41.732 --> 13:43.379
This day is yours!

13:43.502 --> 13:45.489
And nopony's gonna take it away from you!

13:46.282 --> 13:48.189
Am I right?!

13:48.882 --> 13:49.762
Right!

13:51.559 --> 13:54.772
What?! He's delivered
the wrong mail, again!

14:00.465 --> 14:04.313
And new Fluttershy does not want
the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.

14:05.443 --> 14:06.958
Did I mix them up again?

14:07.149 --> 14:08.822
Sorry about that.

14:08.922 --> 14:12.016
"You apologize, I penalize!"

14:22.265 --> 14:25.326
Excuse me, do you know how
to get to the Ponyville tower?

14:25.477 --> 14:26.993
Sure, you just--

14:30.202 --> 14:31.826
That's a shame.

14:32.542 --> 14:35.796
"You make me lose, I blow my fuse!"

14:41.222 --> 14:43.282
Fluttershy! What are you doing?!

14:43.422 --> 14:45.038
That's no way to behave.

14:45.172 --> 14:47.467
Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy?

14:47.602 --> 14:50.522
And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!

14:51.395 --> 14:54.276
No, sweetie, he didn't.
We saw the whole thing.

14:54.702 --> 14:57.077
We think that you've taken
your assertiveness training

14:57.212 --> 14:58.378
a little too far.

14:58.982 --> 14:59.679
What?!

14:59.822 --> 15:03.622
You just want new Fluttershy
to be a doormat like old Fluttershy!

15:03.753 --> 15:06.565
But old Fluttershy is GONE!

15:06.716 --> 15:09.518
New Fluttershy... old Fluttershy...!?

15:09.669 --> 15:11.766
What happened to nice Fluttershy?

15:11.917 --> 15:13.246
We want that Fluttershy back.

15:13.402 --> 15:17.782
No, you want wimp Fluttershy.
You want pushover Fluttershy.

15:18.082 --> 15:21.422
You want do-anything-to-her
and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!

15:22.272 --> 15:26.052
Too many Fluttershies to keep track of!
Make it stop!

15:26.195 --> 15:29.813
Things getting too complicated for
your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?

15:31.372 --> 15:33.122
Now, stop right there!

15:33.223 --> 15:35.932
Let's not let things descend
into petty insults!

15:36.083 --> 15:39.622
Why not? I thought "petty"
was what you're all about, Rarity.

15:39.753 --> 15:41.742
With your "petty" concerns about fashion.

15:43.284 --> 15:46.195
Hey, leave her alone!
Fashion is her passion!

15:46.562 --> 15:50.649
Oh, and what are you passionate about?
Birthday cake? Party hats?

15:51.142 --> 15:53.796
I can't believe that the two most
frivolous ponies in Ponyville

15:53.932 --> 15:56.604
are trying to tell new Fluttershy
how to live her life

15:56.752 --> 15:59.772
when they are throwing their own lives
away on pointless pursuits,

15:59.922 --> 16:03.105
that nopony else gives
a flying feather about!

16:03.922 --> 16:07.301
Looks like nasty Fluttershy
is here to stay!

16:08.023 --> 16:12.153
I cannot believe what that monster,
Iron Will, has done to you!

16:14.972 --> 16:18.969
Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur!

16:26.285 --> 16:28.066
...I'm the monster.

16:40.242 --> 16:42.550
Fluttershy, are you in there?

16:42.701 --> 16:44.767
It's Pinkie Pie, and Rarity!

16:44.921 --> 16:48.813
Go away! Go away before
nasty Fluttershy strikes again!

16:48.942 --> 16:52.074
Oh, sweetie,
we all said things that we regret.

16:52.192 --> 16:53.175
We did?

16:53.322 --> 16:56.022
Pinkie's right. I'm the only one to blame.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.322
But don't worry, I'm never
coming out of my house again.

16:59.473 --> 17:03.760
Everypony will be a lot safer with me
and my mean mouth locked away.

17:03.900 --> 17:04.750
Sweetie,

17:04.900 --> 17:07.727
Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you,
nor do I.

17:07.877 --> 17:10.762
You just received some bad advice
from that Iron Will character.

17:10.892 --> 17:14.430
Yeah! He's the one that
made you act super-duper nasty.

17:15.322 --> 17:16.217
What I mean is,

17:16.358 --> 17:19.872
there are other ways to assert yourself
besides yelling at everypony.

17:19.994 --> 17:20.445
Yes!

17:20.576 --> 17:24.088
You can stand up for yourself
without being unpleasant about it.

17:24.222 --> 17:26.322
I'm not sure I can.

17:26.477 --> 17:27.923
I'm too far gone.

17:28.074 --> 17:29.189
Whenever I try to assert myself,

17:29.312 --> 17:30.975
I become a monster.

17:32.658 --> 17:35.792
Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster.

17:35.892 --> 17:37.098
No, but he is.

17:38.632 --> 17:41.993
Iron Will's my name,
training ponies is my game.

17:43.848 --> 17:46.249
What a darling little catchphrase.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.518
Your friend Fluttershy loved
Iron Will's catchphrases.

17:49.662 --> 17:53.056
Word on the street is that
she doesn't take no duff from nopony!

17:53.207 --> 17:57.114
So, Iron Will is here
to collect Iron Will's fee.

17:57.265 --> 18:00.099
Fluttershy's in no shape
to deal with that creep!

18:00.900 --> 18:04.772
I'm sure a big, brave,
powerful and rich monster--

18:04.922 --> 18:07.344
I mean, minotaur, like you,

18:07.475 --> 18:09.431
doesn't need that money right away.

18:09.572 --> 18:10.876
You can afford to come back later.

18:11.032 --> 18:13.562
Are you kidding?
Fluttershy is overdue as it is.

18:13.712 --> 18:15.897
Iron Will collects now.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.568
Do something!

18:20.722 --> 18:22.692
We're not even sure
Fluttershy is home right now.

18:22.822 --> 18:25.409
She might be off frolicking
with some woodland creatures.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.535
Why don't you give us some time
to track her down for ya?

18:27.666 --> 18:30.712
Iron Will does have some
grocery shopping to do.

18:32.232 --> 18:34.907
Iron Will will come back this afternoon.

18:35.052 --> 18:36.522
But that's only half a day.

18:36.652 --> 18:38.572
We need one full day at least.

18:38.713 --> 18:41.700
Iron Will will delay for half a day
and no longer!

18:41.821 --> 18:42.721
A full day!

18:42.852 --> 18:43.722
Half day!

18:43.843 --> 18:44.423
Full day!

18:44.554 --> 18:45.424
Half day!

18:45.555 --> 18:46.425
Half day!

18:46.556 --> 18:47.372
Full day!

18:47.477 --> 18:49.822
We need half a day and no more!

18:49.973 --> 18:52.318
You'll get a full day and no less!

18:52.462 --> 18:54.393
Okie dokie. See you tomorrow.

18:54.522 --> 18:55.294
Wait, what?

18:57.424 --> 18:59.873
Sounds like the search
won't be necessary.

19:00.022 --> 19:02.435
Iron Will collects now.

19:02.582 --> 19:05.431
But we had an agreement!
You gotta come back tomorrow!

19:05.572 --> 19:09.542
"When somepony tries to block,
show them that you rock!"

19:15.269 --> 19:17.529
Your payment is overdue, Fluttershy!

19:25.881 --> 19:27.690
You were nothing but a doormat!

19:27.822 --> 19:31.888
And Iron Will turned you into a lean,
mean, assertive machine!

19:33.292 --> 19:36.562
Now, pay Iron Will what you owe Iron Will!

19:37.363 --> 19:38.859
Um, no.

19:41.965 --> 19:43.639
What did you say?

19:43.770 --> 19:44.640
No.

19:45.963 --> 19:47.556
I'd hate to be you right now.

19:47.692 --> 19:50.758
Because Iron Will is gonna
rain down a world of hurt

19:50.882 --> 19:54.285
unless Iron Will gets his money pronto!

19:55.822 --> 19:58.251
As I recall, during your workshop,
you promised

19:58.382 --> 20:00.553
one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed

20:00.674 --> 20:01.594
or you pay nothing.

20:01.732 --> 20:03.842
Well, I'm not satisfied.

20:03.992 --> 20:05.872
What do you mean, you're not satisfied?!

20:06.022 --> 20:08.422
Everypony has always been satisfied!

20:08.577 --> 20:10.327
Well I guess I'm the first then.

20:10.448 --> 20:11.420
But since I'm not satisfied,

20:11.570 --> 20:12.800
I refuse to pay.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.927
It's as simple as that.

20:24.187 --> 20:26.372
Are you sure you're not
just a little bit satisfied?

20:26.522 --> 20:28.525
Because maybe... we could, cut a deal...

20:28.676 --> 20:31.400
I mean, we're both reasonable creatures,
aren't we?

20:31.550 --> 20:34.437
I'm sorry, but no means no.

20:34.588 --> 20:36.515
No means no, huh?

20:36.660 --> 20:38.847
Nopony's ever said that to me before.

20:39.998 --> 20:40.998
I gotta remember that one.

20:41.492 --> 20:44.042
That's a good catchphrase
for my next workshop.

20:45.222 --> 20:47.022
You're amazing, Fluttershy!

20:47.162 --> 20:49.152
You totally stood up to that monster!

20:49.273 --> 20:50.664
In fact, you didn't change at all!

20:50.795 --> 20:54.154
You were the same old Fluttershy
that we've always loved!

20:54.285 --> 20:55.959
The one we missed!

20:56.100 --> 20:58.568
Don't worry,
old Fluttershy's back for good.

20:58.569 --> 21:01.649
I'm sorry I took the whole
assertiveness thing too far.

21:01.780 --> 21:02.950
Friends?

21:05.074 --> 21:06.512
Friends!

21:08.276 --> 21:10.049
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

21:10.200 --> 21:14.215
<i>Sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony
like me to stand up for myself.</i>

21:14.366 --> 21:15.464
<i>And when I first tried it,</i>

21:15.615 --> 21:17.322
<i>I didn't like the pony I became.</i>

21:17.720 --> 21:20.310
<i>But I've learned that standing up
for yourself isn't the same</i>

21:20.453 --> 21:22.124
<i>as changing who you are.</i>

21:22.325 --> 21:27.092
<i>Now I know how to put my hoof down,
without being unpleasant, or mean.</i>
