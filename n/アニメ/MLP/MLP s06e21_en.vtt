00:12.108 --> 00:14.205
I've prepared a
full day of spells.

00:14.314 --> 00:15.594
You've been doing great,

00:15.622 --> 00:18.257
but now it's time
for a real challenge.

00:18.594 --> 00:22.548
Oh, it is on. Where
do we begin?

00:22.731 --> 00:26.794
Teleportation. Multiple
locations. Try to keep up.

00:42.897 --> 00:44.405
Transfiguration!

00:56.142 --> 00:56.954
SHIELDS!

01:18.914 --> 01:22.445
Whoo! I am on FIRE!
What's next?

01:22.828 --> 01:25.325
Maybe there is such a
thing as too much studying.

02:07.126 --> 02:11.150
As you know, speed spells
like Accelero are not easy.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.790
But if done correctly,
they can allow you to be

02:13.864 --> 02:15.390
much more efficient
with your day.

02:21.255 --> 02:22.529
Way to go,
Starlight!

02:22.849 --> 02:27.833
Oh, I'm not finished. I've
discovered a very old spell,

02:27.963 --> 02:29.772
Similo Duplexus.

02:29.956 --> 02:33.144
When combined with Accelero
in just the right way...

02:36.150 --> 02:39.009
...you can literally be
in two places at once!

02:42.633 --> 02:44.744
NOW I'm finished.

02:45.193 --> 02:48.252
I have to admit, your skills
with magic really are

02:48.295 --> 02:51.698
nothing short of amazing.
I'm very impressed.

02:52.953 --> 02:55.501
I've always been
something of a natural.

02:55.821 --> 02:57.827
However, it doesn't
look like you've tackled

02:57.870 --> 03:00.172
any friendship lessons
since you met Trixie.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.286
Are you sure? I
could have sworn

03:03.341 --> 03:05.243
there were a couple
in there somewhere.

03:05.987 --> 03:07.058
I'm sure.

03:07.452 --> 03:12.455
I see. Well, I'm really
quite busy this week...

03:12.621 --> 03:16.196
so many commitments! I'll try
and find some time in my --

03:16.270 --> 03:17.735
No time like
the present!

03:18.067 --> 03:19.624
Spike and I are
headed to Canterlot.

03:19.858 --> 03:21.729
Princess Celestia wanted
me to give her students

03:21.770 --> 03:23.083
a quick overview
on the history

03:23.101 --> 03:24.640
of enchanted objects
in Equestria.

03:24.818 --> 03:27.243
We'll be back after the
presentation, which should be-

03:27.563 --> 03:29.040
20 moons from now?

03:29.384 --> 03:32.153
Tonight. It's a
quick presentation.

03:32.430 --> 03:34.904
Sure. Keep tellin'
yourself that.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.286
You can tackle a
friendship lesson today

03:37.323 --> 03:38.547
and we can review
your progress

03:38.596 --> 03:40.104
when I get back
later this evening.

03:40.487 --> 03:45.891
Of course! No problem.
Friendship lesson. On it!

03:46.547 --> 03:47.956
Great! Can't wait!

03:48.301 --> 03:50.332
Now Spike, help me
color code these cards

03:50.381 --> 03:52.523
according to time,
place and object.

04:05.581 --> 04:06.713
Huh? Oh.

04:09.243 --> 04:11.895
Hey! Twilight and I are
about to head to Canterlot.

04:12.055 --> 04:14.516
Just checking to see if you
need anything before we left.

04:14.886 --> 04:15.840
Nope! Not at all!

04:15.901 --> 04:17.489
I'm good here. Not
good. Great.

04:17.526 --> 04:19.107
Not a problem in
the world.

04:20.129 --> 04:21.440
Uh-huh.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.363
So... what are
you doing exactly?

04:25.452 --> 04:29.581
I was... just trying to decide
which friendship lesson

04:29.612 --> 04:32.147
I was going to tackle while
you two were in Canterlot!

04:32.972 --> 04:36.756
Oh, yup. Right here. Where I
just left them a second ago!

04:38.492 --> 04:41.735
Bake a cake with Pinkie Pie,
scrapbook with Applejack,

04:41.827 --> 04:43.495
sew with Rarity...

04:43.698 --> 04:44.486
Uh.

04:44.769 --> 04:46.756
Help an animal with Fluttershy,

04:47.083 --> 04:51.218
chillax with Rainbow
Dash? What is chillaxing?

04:51.993 --> 04:53.249
No idea.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.098
You know, uh, if
you're nervous about

04:56.116 --> 04:59.396
your friendship lessons,
it's totally okay to say so.

04:59.729 --> 05:04.596
NERVOUS?! ME!
HAHAHA. Oh Spike.

05:04.633 --> 05:08.375
You really are hilarious.
You think I'm nervous

05:08.424 --> 05:09.784
that I'm going to
fail something

05:09.827 --> 05:12.301
as simple as baking
a cake?

05:12.615 --> 05:14.172
Well, if you were,
it would be--

05:14.227 --> 05:17.372
Silly! Twilight just said
how impressed she was

05:17.415 --> 05:20.061
that I combined a speed spell
and a duplication spell.

05:20.436 --> 05:23.372
THAT was a challenge.
These? Ha!

05:23.796 --> 05:26.227
I could combine all five
of these at the same time

05:26.270 --> 05:28.196
without breaking a sweat!

05:28.473 --> 05:29.692
I think maybe you're missing--

05:29.735 --> 05:32.073
An opportunity to
really impress Twilight?

05:32.486 --> 05:35.932
Great idea, Spike! I'm gonna
get right on that. Good talk!

05:37.470 --> 05:40.381
And I thought Twilight was
the master of the freakout.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.378
So, with your help,
I figure

05:43.409 --> 05:44.978
these should be
done in no time!

05:45.261 --> 05:47.433
Are you sure this is what
Twilight would want?

05:48.018 --> 05:49.723
Seems like you might
wanna take your time

05:49.766 --> 05:50.689
with each of these.

05:50.916 --> 05:54.356
But by working as a team,
we can get them done faster.

05:54.523 --> 05:57.507
And isn't teamwork a key
factor in friendship?

05:58.793 --> 06:00.480
I guess.

06:00.695 --> 06:03.113
Super! Pinkie Pie,
since we're baking,

06:03.163 --> 06:04.264
you will be in
the kitchen.

06:05.421 --> 06:07.981
Rarity, Applejack you two
can set up in the library.

06:08.215 --> 06:10.350
Oh, I don't know that
the dusty old library

06:10.393 --> 06:11.612
has the proper lighting.

06:11.778 --> 06:13.747
Perhaps we can stay
out here in the foyer?

06:14.116 --> 06:16.116
I thought that Fluttershy and
I could work with the animals

06:16.160 --> 06:17.187
right here in the foyer.

06:17.433 --> 06:19.760
Oh, um, whatever
you think is best.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.907
Great. Now, Rainbow Dash--

06:21.950 --> 06:23.563
<i>But it might depend</i>
<i> on the animal.</i>

06:23.753 --> 06:26.547
For instance, this poor little
eagle with a sprained wing

06:26.572 --> 06:28.855
might be better off up
in one of the towers.

06:29.009 --> 06:29.926
Yeah, yeah, yeah sure.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.175
And these adorable chipmunks
might prefer a nook somewhere.

06:33.329 --> 06:35.372
Maybe if you spent
some time getting to-

06:35.415 --> 06:36.553
In a minute, Fluttershy.

06:37.809 --> 06:40.972
Uh, I don't know if we
can chillax properly

06:41.027 --> 06:44.184
in the castle. We need
very specific conditions

06:44.258 --> 06:45.766
for optimal chillaxing.

06:46.049 --> 06:49.415
Oh. I just assumed chillaxing
could happen anywhere.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.566
Ha. Shows what you know
about chillaxing.

06:52.818 --> 06:54.203
Let me do some
location scouting.

06:55.144 --> 06:58.264
O-kay. Uh, it seemed
more efficient to

06:58.313 --> 07:00.264
start with the scrapbooking
so we could just get it out--

07:00.332 --> 07:02.184
Oh! Oh! oh!
Can we start with me?

07:02.240 --> 07:05.901
We're gonna need time for the
cake to bake! After all...

07:06.098 --> 07:09.889
<i> ♪ It's a piece of cake</i>
<i> to bake a pretty cake-- ♪</i>

07:09.926 --> 07:13.040
Uh, we're on a schedule.
No time for a song.

07:13.206 --> 07:15.212
We can start with
baking. THEN--

07:15.249 --> 07:17.249
But we can't design dresses
after you've been baking

07:17.273 --> 07:20.178
with Pinkie. She
can be a bit messy.

07:25.316 --> 07:28.436
Fine. We can start with
the dresses and THEN--

07:28.467 --> 07:30.584
While y'all figure that out,
I'm gonna start layin out

07:30.609 --> 07:31.796
the pictures for scrapbooking.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.110
We've got a whole
lot of time to cover.

07:34.338 --> 07:35.827
How much is a whole lot?

07:36.307 --> 07:38.406
We've got at least 80
moons worth of memories

07:38.461 --> 07:39.083
to go through!

07:39.483 --> 07:40.836
80 moons!?

07:41.427 --> 07:42.067
Ugh!

07:42.147 --> 07:44.763
There is NOwhere to
chillax in this castle.

07:45.058 --> 07:46.615
We're gonna have to
set up somewhere else!

07:51.430 --> 07:54.750
Could you all excuse
me for one second?

07:55.981 --> 07:59.655
Wow. That pony really
needs to chillax.

08:04.947 --> 08:06.830
OK, Starlight.
You've got this.

08:06.935 --> 08:08.572
A handful of friendship
lessons is nothing

08:08.603 --> 08:10.849
compared to the spells
you've mastered.

08:12.941 --> 08:16.430
Maybe if I cast a little
spell to help things along.

08:16.603 --> 08:20.141
Something simple and
safe. Fiducia Compelus?

08:20.283 --> 08:22.338
That's not bad. They
would barely notice it.

08:22.443 --> 08:23.981
But is it enough?

08:25.193 --> 08:28.947
Maybe Cogeria so they are
more open to suggestion?

08:29.052 --> 08:33.360
Or maybe Cogeria combined
with Fiducia Compelus!

08:33.661 --> 08:36.664
Yes... that could work nicely.

08:36.726 --> 08:40.516
Oh, with a hint of Persuadere
to be sure it sticks.

08:45.538 --> 08:47.280
Everypony will
probably thank me

08:47.335 --> 08:49.040
for getting it all
done so quickly.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.529
And Twilight will
be thrilled

08:50.590 --> 08:54.707
I've completed so many
lessons. Everypony wins!

08:58.966 --> 09:02.523
Congratulations Starlight,
you're a genius.

09:10.461 --> 09:13.384
Maybe the congratulations
were a little premature.

09:22.473 --> 09:26.233
Cogeria...
Persuadere...Fiducia...

09:26.504 --> 09:31.316
Oh, of course! Fiducia
Compelus needs a trigger!

09:32.320 --> 09:34.806
PONIES! HEAR MY
VOICE AND LISTEN.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.286
Pinkie, kitchen. Rarity,
Applejack, library.

09:41.335 --> 09:42.523
Fluttershy, stay here.

09:42.584 --> 09:45.329
Rainbow Dash, find
somewhere INSIDE the castle

09:45.353 --> 09:47.156
and set up a place
where we can chillax.

09:54.486 --> 09:55.833
Let's get to work, Pinkie!

09:56.012 --> 09:58.873
Okie-Dokie. What would
you like to do first?

09:59.255 --> 10:01.470
Uh. What are we
supposed to do first?

10:01.963 --> 10:05.015
Whatever you want to do
first, Starlight Glimmer.

10:06.049 --> 10:07.544
In a medium-sized
mixing bowl,

10:07.606 --> 10:10.873
beat together eggs, sugar and
two teaspoons of vanilla...

10:13.298 --> 10:14.264
Mix in flour...

10:17.378 --> 10:19.193
Add baking soda,
salt and cinnamon.

10:21.113 --> 10:22.313
I think you can
take it from here.

10:22.738 --> 10:24.123
Take what from where?

10:24.806 --> 10:27.969
The baking. Just keep
following the instructions

10:28.018 --> 10:29.156
in the book until I get back.

10:29.624 --> 10:30.621
Absotively!

10:30.670 --> 10:33.286
Instruction following starting... NOW!

10:34.769 --> 10:37.735
Baking a cake, check!
Now on to sewing.

10:40.824 --> 10:42.153
What did you have
in mind, Rarity?

10:42.646 --> 10:45.575
Whatever you want me to have
in my mind, Starlight Glimmer.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.581
Can you make a dress
exactly like that one?

10:54.646 --> 10:55.993
JUST like this one?

10:56.313 --> 10:57.101
Just like it.

10:57.206 --> 11:00.067
Absolutely! It will
look perfectly divine!

11:03.796 --> 11:05.963
That's a whole
lot of photos.

11:06.030 --> 11:07.593
How do you usually
organize them?

11:07.926 --> 11:10.732
However you want me to
organize them, Starlight.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.310
Ok. Tell me
about this one.

11:13.778 --> 11:16.344
Sweet Apple Acres.
20 moons ago.

11:16.750 --> 11:19.138
Granny Smith was looking
for her favorite pie tin.

11:19.526 --> 11:21.870
She looked in the kitchen,
but it wasn't there.

11:21.938 --> 11:24.781
She looked in the barn,
but it wasn't there.

11:25.938 --> 11:28.473
I don't need every
little detail.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.726
Just sum up the story
in one sentence.

11:31.636 --> 11:34.443
Huh. Turns out Granny
Smith didn't know

11:34.486 --> 11:36.473
HOW to make a pig
do the backstroke.

11:37.556 --> 11:41.107
Uh-huh. Why don't you
keep putting these photos

11:41.150 --> 11:43.163
in chronological order
and when I come back

11:43.193 --> 11:45.741
you can give me
more highlights.

11:46.935 --> 11:49.003
Sure thing,
Starlight Glimmer.

11:50.732 --> 11:53.255
Fluttershy? Where
are all the animals?

11:53.772 --> 11:54.966
They ran away.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.163
And why didn't
you stop them?

11:57.452 --> 11:59.618
Because you
didn't ask me to.

12:00.110 --> 12:03.341
Obviously I wanted
you to-- never mind.

12:03.513 --> 12:06.320
Can you please round up all
the animals in the castle

12:06.356 --> 12:07.932
and bring them back
here to the foyer.

12:08.375 --> 12:10.233
All the animals. Got it.

12:12.363 --> 12:14.320
Did you find a place to
chillax, Rainbow Dash?

12:14.547 --> 12:16.560
Sure thing,
Starlight Glimmer.

12:17.052 --> 12:18.498
Great. Let me know
when it's ready.

12:18.843 --> 12:20.535
Yes, Starlight Glimmer!

12:24.184 --> 12:26.763
Granny Smith knew she was
gonna need a bigger boat.

12:27.076 --> 12:29.895
So Goldie Delicious says, "If
you can't say anything nice

12:29.932 --> 12:32.381
about anypony...
come sit by me!"

12:33.027 --> 12:35.581
Big Mac knew if he just
covered himself in mud,

12:35.716 --> 12:37.667
the creature wouldn't
be able to see him.

12:37.944 --> 12:41.741
Starlight Glimmer!
I have finished the dress!

12:42.000 --> 12:43.070
Isn't it gorgeous?

12:43.606 --> 12:44.732
What is that?

12:44.960 --> 12:46.104
You wanted me
to make a dress

12:46.215 --> 12:47.753
exactly like the
one in the book.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.735
Go make a REAL
dress out of fabric

12:51.963 --> 12:53.470
exactly like the
one in the book.

12:53.901 --> 12:57.396
Ahhhh. I see. Yes, of
course, Starlight Glimmer.

13:00.209 --> 13:03.920
Rarity! Make it BIGGER
than the one in the book.

13:04.590 --> 13:06.756
Of course, darling.
Bigger it is.

13:08.886 --> 13:12.030
She was just a pony, standing
in front of another pony,

13:12.123 --> 13:13.692
asking him to love her.

13:20.455 --> 13:22.320
Pinkie, what are you doing?!

13:22.646 --> 13:24.867
Following all of the
instructions in the cookbook

13:24.910 --> 13:26.578
in order, Starlight Glimmer!

13:26.664 --> 13:30.640
I meant just the ONE cake! I
was only gone a few minutes!

13:30.726 --> 13:33.710
How in Equestria did you get
all of this done so fast?

13:34.153 --> 13:36.147
First I combined
three eggs, then--

13:40.307 --> 13:41.704
I think the baking
lesson is done.

13:43.058 --> 13:44.264
Oh, what now?

13:48.867 --> 13:52.843
They can take our farm, but
they can't take our freedom!

13:54.830 --> 13:56.080
What's going on?

13:58.356 --> 14:00.849
I've gathered all of the
animals like you asked,

14:00.916 --> 14:02.153
Starlight Glimmer.

14:06.067 --> 14:10.307
Oh yes, this will do
nicely. A MUCH bigger dress!

14:11.249 --> 14:12.836
It was the best
of apples;

14:12.916 --> 14:14.756
it was the worst
of apples.

14:16.295 --> 14:20.178
I can handle this. It's just
magic and I know magic.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.166
What's that?

14:26.252 --> 14:27.323
What did you say?

14:27.944 --> 14:31.378
The cakes are burning!
You left the ovens on!

14:32.073 --> 14:33.335
We need water!

14:34.012 --> 14:35.513
Yes, Starlight Glimmer.

14:39.255 --> 14:41.015
Storm clouds?!

14:57.600 --> 14:59.987
Big Mac told me, with
a whole lotta power

15:00.129 --> 15:02.480
comes a heckuva lot
of responsibility.

15:03.064 --> 15:05.513
This can't get any worse.

15:08.098 --> 15:09.870
WHAT IS GOING ON!?

15:16.240 --> 15:18.867
I had no idea we had
spiders in the castle.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.701
I'm never sleeping again.

15:20.861 --> 15:24.184
Maybe if I had reversed the
Fiducia Compelus and Cogeria.

15:24.418 --> 15:26.800
Or maybe I added
too much Persuadere.

15:27.821 --> 15:28.338
What?

15:28.873 --> 15:31.040
You're really missing
the point here.

15:31.372 --> 15:34.030
I finally untangled
that mess of a spell

15:34.073 --> 15:37.661
and got everypony home. It
was really powerful stuff.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.643
They're gonna feel
that in the morning.

15:40.061 --> 15:42.196
Now, please try to
explain to me

15:42.301 --> 15:43.686
how in the name
of Celestia

15:43.716 --> 15:45.483
things got this
out of control?

15:45.796 --> 15:49.169
Well, it was the first time
I cast that particular spell

15:49.176 --> 15:50.758
and I didn't fully
think it through.

15:50.768 --> 15:51.857
I bet if I had reversed--

15:51.893 --> 15:53.915
I think you might be
missing the point here.

15:54.386 --> 15:55.111
Told ya.

15:55.511 --> 15:57.168
What made you think
that casting a spell

15:57.186 --> 15:58.608
on your friends
to do your bidding

15:58.640 --> 16:00.524
was even remotely
a good idea?

16:01.244 --> 16:04.635
Well, when you put it that
way, it sounds really bad.

16:04.955 --> 16:06.871
That's because it
IS really bad!

16:07.133 --> 16:07.768
Uh...

16:09.075 --> 16:12.853
Starlight. I'm not mad at
you. But I am disappointed.

16:13.151 --> 16:15.973
You've been doing so well.
I just don't understand

16:16.008 --> 16:18.515
how a friendship lesson
turned into all of this?

16:18.768 --> 16:20.422
Ugh. Fine!

16:20.968 --> 16:23.977
I've been avoiding the
friendship lessons on purpose.

16:24.448 --> 16:25.231
Why?

16:25.777 --> 16:27.511
I can cast complex spells.

16:27.537 --> 16:30.462
But baking a cake with
Pinkie Pie freaks me out.

16:30.746 --> 16:33.435
And yes I know how
ridiculous that sounds.

16:33.475 --> 16:35.022
That's why I didn't
say anything.

16:35.377 --> 16:37.004
I thought if I just
kept wowing you

16:37.044 --> 16:41.080
with my magical abilities,
you might just... not notice.

16:41.808 --> 16:43.626
Baking a cake
freaks you out?

16:43.973 --> 16:47.324
Yes! Baking a cake,
sewing. All of it.

16:47.804 --> 16:49.306
What if I was
bad at it?

16:49.648 --> 16:51.902
I didn't want to be a
disappointment to anypony

16:51.924 --> 16:55.342
and I ended up being a
disappointment to everypony.

16:55.911 --> 16:58.426
Starlight. Do you
think anypony cares

16:58.462 --> 16:59.795
if you can bake a cake?

17:00.151 --> 17:01.600
But the lesson--

17:01.755 --> 17:03.768
Was to get to know
Pinkie Pie better

17:03.795 --> 17:05.586
by doing something
she loves.

17:05.773 --> 17:08.937
It was a friendship lesson,
not a baking lesson.

17:09.342 --> 17:12.284
Oh. You know I think I might
have missed the point here.

17:12.711 --> 17:13.480
Told ya.

17:13.724 --> 17:14.995
So now what?

17:15.373 --> 17:18.146
Now it's time for a pretty
advanced friendship lesson.

17:18.315 --> 17:20.351
It's called apologizing.

17:25.195 --> 17:28.711
I dunno what kinda whammy
Starlight put on us,

17:29.097 --> 17:31.040
but I feel like I got
shoved through the

17:31.084 --> 17:34.048
Super Speedy Cider
Squeezy 6000™.

17:34.328 --> 17:36.577
Ugh! Tell me about it.

17:36.871 --> 17:40.475
If everypony could speak in a
whisper for the next few days,

17:40.728 --> 17:44.337
that would be delightful.
My head is thumping.

17:44.791 --> 17:47.342
I was up all night
calming the animals down.

17:47.564 --> 17:50.351
Fluttershy, please!
Not so loud.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.373
Starlight's spell made me
burn perfectly good cake!

17:53.644 --> 17:55.551
I NEVER burn cake!

17:56.177 --> 17:57.920
<i>Yeah, about that...</i>

17:58.226 --> 18:00.600
Things got a little
out of hand last night.

18:00.853 --> 18:03.440
Ain't that the
understatement of the day?

18:04.346 --> 18:06.217
Tell it to the cakes, sister!

18:06.728 --> 18:10.795
Can we all PLEASE argue
at a lower volume?

18:11.066 --> 18:13.080
I really messed up.

18:13.417 --> 18:16.746
I cast the spell because I was
nervous about working with you

18:16.768 --> 18:18.186
on the friendship lessons.

18:18.586 --> 18:21.075
Well, here's a friendship
lesson for you.

18:21.675 --> 18:24.595
Don't cast spells
on your friends!

18:25.164 --> 18:27.222
Believe me; I know.

18:27.613 --> 18:30.408
What I did was wrong and
I can't take it back.

18:31.017 --> 18:33.880
You're right to be upset
and I hope one day,

18:34.231 --> 18:39.382
I can make it up to you. But
all I can say is I'm sorry.

18:40.231 --> 18:43.604
Now if you'll excuse me, I've
got to go clean the castle

18:43.653 --> 18:46.475
covered in wet cake
batter and spiders.

18:47.546 --> 18:49.577
That was a pretty
good apology.

18:49.791 --> 18:51.780
Seems like she
feels really bad.

18:52.657 --> 18:55.768
Hey, Starlight! Most of
the Apple family photos

18:55.786 --> 18:57.391
are still laying
around in the wreckage.

18:57.631 --> 18:59.444
I think I'll come along
and hunt 'em down.

18:59.737 --> 19:02.688
Oh! And I feel awful for
disturbing all of those

19:02.733 --> 19:05.648
cute little spiders and
bats. I should check on them.

19:06.013 --> 19:08.977
Ah, yes. And I left
some lovely fabric out;

19:09.093 --> 19:11.942
I should come move it to
that nice quiet library.

19:12.111 --> 19:15.040
Uh, I'll come and get
those storm clouds

19:15.084 --> 19:15.982
out of the bathroom.

19:16.302 --> 19:19.466
Fine! Somepony has to
bake a cake to honor

19:19.488 --> 19:22.333
all of the poor cakes that
sacrificed their batter

19:22.391 --> 19:24.355
in last night's tragedy.

20:13.711 --> 20:15.564
It seems your
apology went well.

20:15.973 --> 20:19.546
I'm just lucky to have
such understanding friends.

20:19.871 --> 20:21.315
But it's probably
going to be a while

20:21.342 --> 20:24.013
before I try to tackle those
friendship lessons again.

20:24.448 --> 20:27.022
What do you mean? You've
been doing them all day!

20:27.333 --> 20:28.826
What are you
talking about?

20:28.880 --> 20:30.520
I've been cleaning
up the mess I made

20:30.546 --> 20:32.320
by totally failing
at friendship.

20:32.764 --> 20:35.768
Really? But didn't I see
you sewing with Rarity?

20:36.048 --> 20:37.062
Yes but--

20:37.208 --> 20:39.337
And you and Applejack did
a great job collecting

20:39.368 --> 20:41.164
those photos and putting
them in the book.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.057
Helping animals with Fluttershy,

20:43.280 --> 20:44.617
baking with Pinkie Pie.

20:44.764 --> 20:46.591
Those sound like your
assignments to me.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.071
In fact, I think there's just
one that you're missing.

20:51.253 --> 20:53.484
Sun? Check. Chairs? Check.

20:53.688 --> 20:56.080
And thanks to a simple
catadupa levitata spell,

20:56.111 --> 20:59.128
we've got water! Is that
everything we need to chillax?

20:59.582 --> 21:00.808
Nope.

21:01.053 --> 21:02.631
No? What did I miss?

21:03.746 --> 21:05.057
Quiet.

21:05.511 --> 21:06.608
Ah. Right.

21:07.151 --> 21:08.582
Great job, Starlight.

21:08.671 --> 21:11.235
Looks like you've completed
another friendship lesson.

21:12.897 --> 21:16.902
Hey! She completes the lesson
when I say she completes it.

21:17.262 --> 21:21.040
So less learning
and more chillaxing!

21:24.351 --> 21:27.804
So, how long do we
sit quietly?
