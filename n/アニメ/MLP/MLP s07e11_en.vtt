WEBVTT

00:02.668 --> 00:03.835
Pinkie Pie: Oh, wow!

00:04.137 --> 00:04.936
Oh, my gosh!

00:06.738 --> 00:08.440
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

00:09.942 --> 00:11.276
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

00:11.478 --> 00:12.544
Sorry, Applejack!

00:16.382 --> 00:17.950
Twilight! Twilight,
where are you?!

00:18.252 --> 00:19.484
I'm in here, Pinkie.

00:19.586 --> 00:20.284
What is it?

00:20.586 --> 00:22.588
You'll never guess
what I just got!

00:22.790 --> 00:23.788
Is everything OK?

00:24.390 --> 00:26.658
We heard a lot of "Oh, my
gosh-in'" and we weren't sure

00:26.760 --> 00:28.193
if it was a good thing
or a bad thing.

00:28.695 --> 00:29.961
A good thing!

00:31.064 --> 00:33.265
"To Pink Pony who lives
with baked goods."

00:33.667 --> 00:34.967
It's from the yaks!

00:36.202 --> 00:39.404
"Yaks cordially invite Pink
Pony to Yikslerbertfest."

00:39.506 --> 00:40.873
"Come. NOW!"

00:41.275 --> 00:43.875
Prince Rutherford is officially
inviting me to Yikslerbertfest

00:43.977 --> 00:45.444
in Yakyakistan!

00:45.846 --> 00:48.147
What is "Yikslerbertfest"?

00:48.449 --> 00:50.215
It's a sacred
Yak holiday.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.618
How did you get Prince
Rutherford to invite you?

00:53.220 --> 00:56.788
I subtly hinted for an
invitation in my letters to him.

00:58.424 --> 01:00.392
<i> May I please come</i>
<i> to Yikslerbertfest?</i>

01:00.594 --> 01:01.526
<i> Pretty please?</i>

01:02.028 --> 01:02.826
<i> Pretty please!</i>

01:03.150 --> 01:03.827
<i> Pretty please!</i>

01:03.928 --> 01:05.364
<i> Pretty, pretty, pretty,</i>
<i> pretty, pretty please!</i>

01:07.366 --> 01:09.868
After my seventeenth scroll,
I think he picked up

01:10.070 --> 01:11.503
what I was putting down.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.438
Hee hee hee hee!

01:55.950 --> 01:58.551
You know, we still don't
know a lot about the yaks.

01:58.753 --> 02:02.221
So I think you should definitely
go to Yikslerbertfest, Pinkie.

02:03.925 --> 02:06.258
Fostering friendships
is what ponies do.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.058
I won't let you down.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.763
It's an honor to be the Official
Friendship Ambassador

02:11.865 --> 02:12.865
to the Yaks!

02:13.167 --> 02:15.768
Um, that's not an
official position.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.368
Yet.

02:17.570 --> 02:18.768
You're the Princess
of Friendship!

02:18.870 --> 02:20.940
You can make
it happen!

02:21.542 --> 02:23.409
OK, you got it.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.879
Ahem. You have to
make it OFFICIAL!

02:28.482 --> 02:30.516
Right. I hereby
make Pinkie Pie

02:30.618 --> 02:32.918
the Official Friendship
Ambassador to the Yaks.

02:37.223 --> 02:40.760
This is <i>officially</i>  the most
exciting day of my life!

02:45.566 --> 02:47.533
Yoo-hoo, Gummy! Pay attention.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.601
We're in the middle of an
Official Friendship Ambassador

02:49.703 --> 02:50.536
Road Trip Game.

02:54.107 --> 02:54.806
That's better.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.376
OK, I spy with my
official friendship eye

02:57.578 --> 02:58.878
something that is blue.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.554
[gasp] We're here!

03:11.291 --> 03:14.593
Oh, and by the way, the
answer was "sky." I win!

03:16.563 --> 03:18.765
Yeah, I know that was
a hard one, Gummy.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.433
You're the best Official
Friendship Travel Companion

03:21.835 --> 03:22.468
ever!

03:28.209 --> 03:29.475
What is going on!?

03:31.878 --> 03:33.512
Yaks destroy!

03:34.014 --> 03:35.748
All : Yaks destroy!!

03:36.350 --> 03:37.182
Yikes!

03:38.551 --> 03:40.285
Ha ha! Pink Pony!

03:41.821 --> 03:44.790
It's an honor to [crash] er..
be here, Prince!

03:44.892 --> 03:47.226
[crash] Uh, did something
terrible happen?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.762
Is Yikslerbertfest canceled!?

03:50.264 --> 03:52.498
No. This Yikslerbertfest.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.867
Where yaks get
together to stomp.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.371
Ohhhh, I didn't know that was
part of the sacred holiday.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.073
So this angry display
of destruction

04:01.175 --> 04:02.308
is part of the festivities.

04:02.410 --> 04:05.511
Heh. And here I thought you yaks
were just in a bad mood.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.680
No. Stomping relaxes yaks.

04:09.916 --> 04:10.882
Hey ah!

04:13.354 --> 04:15.787
Yak's head never been so clear.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.291
This is AWESOME!

04:24.397 --> 04:25.597
STOP!

04:28.868 --> 04:31.838
Pink Pony better check
self before wreck self.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.976
That is century-old sacred
Yak Twig passed down

04:37.078 --> 04:39.912
from generation to generation.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.847
[Gasp!] Oh, no!

04:41.949 --> 04:43.247
I'm so sorry!

04:43.549 --> 04:46.418
I was just trying to get into
the spirit of Yikslerbertfest.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.287
[whining] Maybe I can fix
it--

04:51.224 --> 04:53.392
Ha ha ha! Yak kidding!

04:58.866 --> 05:00.799
Yak got Pink Pony good!

05:00.901 --> 05:02.168
Horn bump!

05:02.870 --> 05:03.603
Gah!

05:04.405 --> 05:05.403
Whew!

05:05.505 --> 05:07.706
You sure did,
Prince Rutherford!

05:08.676 --> 05:10.342
That was a close
one, Gummy.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.644
This trip has to
be perfect!

05:12.846 --> 05:14.880
After all, we're not
just visiting as friends.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.884
We're on Official Friendship
Ambassador business.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.119
Less talking!

05:20.321 --> 05:21.553
More stomping!

05:22.977 --> 05:26.777
Pinkie Pie: Yeah! Uh! Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!

05:28.961 --> 05:32.498
Now, I take Pink Pony
on Yakyakistan tour.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.866
Thanks, Prince Rutherford.

05:33.968 --> 05:36.201
But.. I've been to
Yakyakistan before.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.401
Yak know.

05:37.703 --> 05:40.339
But thought Pink Pony
might not recognize town

05:40.441 --> 05:42.708
since decorated for
Yikslerbertfest.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.910
You're right!

05:45.012 --> 05:47.980
It's so different now that
you've pointed it out. Heh, heh.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.849
Oh, yaks not just have
eye for decorating.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.585
Yaks also amazing builders.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.988
[gasp] No way!

05:56.090 --> 05:59.558
I thought you hired
professional contractors!

06:00.827 --> 06:02.427
Here, let me help
you with that.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.834
This Ceremonial Yak Fire pit.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.802
Where yaks tell stories.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.102
Ooh!

06:12.404 --> 06:15.607
I have so much to officially
tell the ponies when I get back!

06:17.410 --> 06:18.977
This Yak Eating Hut.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.479
Hut where yaks eat.

06:23.249 --> 06:26.452
Mmm, the perfect balance
of vanilla extract.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.654
Yaks grow own vanilla bean.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.122
Nothing imported.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.000
Yak Sleeping Hut.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.735
Hut where yaks sleep.

06:52.645 --> 06:53.846
Yak Music Hut.

06:54.148 --> 06:57.148
Hut where yaks enjoy
beautiful music.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.053
This is beautiful and-

07:01.255 --> 07:03.422
Sssh. Pink Pony
ruin with talking.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.731
... And that how yaks
defeat evil and save world.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.268
Pink Pony like yak story!

07:16.570 --> 07:18.604
A-ha! Yak impressed!

07:18.806 --> 07:21.707
Pink Pony can almost
be Honorary Yak.

07:22.009 --> 07:25.211
Official Friendship
Ambassador and Honorary Yak!?

07:25.913 --> 07:28.213
Pink Pony's title
card is full!

07:28.615 --> 07:29.615
Horn bump!

07:30.817 --> 07:32.651
Oh wait, I don't have a horn.

07:34.353 --> 07:37.256
Prince Rutherford, can I
get some honorary yak horns?

07:37.458 --> 07:40.025
No. Yak horn too heavy
for small pony head.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.165
Yikslerbertfest Stomp Time.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.541
Stomp harder, yaks extra happy!

07:56.643 --> 07:58.777
Ponies and yaks, friends!

08:13.693 --> 08:15.728
Is this part of the festival?

08:16.430 --> 08:17.963
Pink Pony ask too
many questions.

08:25.738 --> 08:29.174
Everything is buried in snow!
What are we going to do!?

08:29.576 --> 08:31.543
[mumbles] Yaks fine.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.912
Snow fall from
mountains all the time.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.347
All the time?

08:35.849 --> 08:37.582
Every Yikslerbertfest.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.385
OK. Avalanches like
this completely bury

08:40.487 --> 08:42.954
all your homes every
Yikslerbertfest?

08:43.156 --> 08:43.922
Really?

08:44.224 --> 08:47.125
This.. is.. big avalanche.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.028
But not a problem,
for yaks are tough!

08:50.130 --> 08:51.996
Yaks dig through snow.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.265
Won't take long.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.467
Oh good, you have an
emergency plan in place.

09:00.339 --> 09:01.372
Here, let me help.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.984
Whoo, I'm tired!

09:13.186 --> 09:14.552
We must be almost done.

09:15.521 --> 09:17.823
There's still snow
everywhere!?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.125
Yaks keep digging!

09:29.902 --> 09:31.636
Ohhhhhh.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.238
Yaks stop digging!

09:33.440 --> 09:34.873
Makes situation worse!

09:35.675 --> 09:37.609
OK, don't worry,
Prince Rutherford.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.011
I'll go back to Ponyville
and ask for help.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.348
Twilight and the others will be
happy to come dig the snow away.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.485
After all, many hooves
make light work!

09:46.887 --> 09:47.652
Right, Gummy?

09:48.054 --> 09:49.988
Yaks no need pony help!

09:54.294 --> 09:55.593
Oh. Well, I'm sure
it'll be OK,

09:55.695 --> 09:56.995
cause you probably
have a plan B.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.165
Yes. Yaks wait
for snow to melt.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.467
All this snow!?

10:02.669 --> 10:05.203
It'll take a thousand
moons before it melts!

10:05.605 --> 10:07.506
Yaks known for their patience.

10:08.208 --> 10:12.110
Well.. be that as it may, in
the meantime, what will you eat?

10:12.312 --> 10:13.511
Where will you sleep?

10:13.713 --> 10:15.614
Bah! Yaks can make this work.

10:15.816 --> 10:19.050
Hardship make yaks the
strong yaks that yaks are!

10:19.152 --> 10:22.887
If Pink Pony disagrees, then she
can leave Yakyakistan

10:22.989 --> 10:24.323
and never return!

10:24.825 --> 10:28.292
Ah! Er.. of course Pink Pony
agrees with you! Heheh..

10:28.594 --> 10:30.795
Hey! Let's try out
some snow recipes!

10:35.000 --> 10:35.667
Snow cakes!

10:36.069 --> 10:36.935
Snow spaghetti!

10:37.437 --> 10:38.470
Snow sandwiches!

10:38.594 --> 10:39.171
Heh, heh..

10:40.240 --> 10:41.406
Mmmmm!

10:41.708 --> 10:43.274
Yaks can make this work!

10:46.478 --> 10:49.180
[yawn] Yak tired.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.349
Yak retire to new Sleeping Hut.

11:01.994 --> 11:02.494
Hmph.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.600
Snow cake good!

11:13.973 --> 11:14.671
Mmmm.

11:14.873 --> 11:17.541
Just the right balance
of cold and water!

11:18.178 --> 11:19.778
Oh! Stop!

11:19.980 --> 11:21.613
Yak eating new Eating Hut!

11:24.684 --> 11:28.353
Psst, Prince Rutherford,
what are we doing?

11:28.755 --> 11:29.721
It's obvious.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.423
This New Music Hut!

11:31.725 --> 11:34.525
Oh. So we're swaying to... ?

11:35.027 --> 11:37.428
Ssshhh. Pink Pony ruin snow
music with talking.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.403
What was yak?

11:45.605 --> 11:47.238
Yak stomach rumbles.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.606
Yak hungry.

11:48.808 --> 11:49.440
Sshh.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.276
Prince Yak will
hear yak!

11:51.578 --> 11:54.045
But snow worse
than yak ever seen!

11:54.347 --> 11:55.413
Yak know.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.015
Yak hungry too.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.484
[gasp!] Gummy, did you hear that?

11:59.586 --> 12:01.119
They can't make it work.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.589
Yaks stop swaying.

12:04.791 --> 12:05.757
Music over.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.326
If Twilight and the others
knew what was going on,

12:08.428 --> 12:10.495
they would be here to help
in a pony's heartbeat.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.296
I have to convince
Prince Rutherford

12:12.398 --> 12:14.365
that asking for help is OK.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.566
Will you help me, Gummy?

12:16.868 --> 12:17.567
Thank you!

12:17.669 --> 12:20.271
And see, asking you to
help wasn't hard at all!

12:23.509 --> 12:25.510
Pink Pony has
gathered you around

12:25.612 --> 12:28.146
the New Ceremonial
Yak Firepit...

12:28.948 --> 12:30.381
... to tell you a story.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.183
A yak tradition, right?

12:34.287 --> 12:35.186
Yay!

12:35.488 --> 12:37.823
This is a story
about a group of...

12:38.525 --> 12:41.693
er.. goats, who live
in the desert.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.795
There was a sandstorm
and their entire village

12:44.897 --> 12:46.597
was buried in sand.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.500
There was nothing they could do.

12:48.802 --> 12:53.171
They knew they could not survive
on only eating sand-wiches!

12:54.073 --> 12:54.573
Get it?

12:57.075 --> 12:57.776
OK.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.980
Anyway, finally, the goat's
brave, wise leader

13:02.282 --> 13:06.451
--let's just call
him Prince er.. Drutherford-- heh, heh

13:06.553 --> 13:09.087
decides that they couldn't
do it by themselves.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.423
So he asked the neighboring
town of uh, Bovineville

13:12.625 --> 13:15.226
to come help them. Yeah! Cows!

13:15.328 --> 13:16.526
The magical cows
helped the goats.

13:16.628 --> 13:18.530
Everyone survived and
lived happily ever after.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.401
Because they asked for help.

13:23.203 --> 13:23.668
The end!

13:27.073 --> 13:29.240
So what is the
moral of that story?

13:29.442 --> 13:32.043
Is it A: asking for
help is OK?

13:32.445 --> 13:35.313
B: asking for help
saves the day?

13:35.615 --> 13:39.484
Or C: asking for help
is good for everypony!?

13:39.686 --> 13:41.619
D: goats weak
and horrible!

13:41.721 --> 13:44.556
Magic Bovines need to stay
out of goats' business!

13:45.558 --> 13:47.826
Um... not quite.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.695
Any-yak wanna shout
out another answer?

13:58.970 --> 14:00.169
Pinkie: Hey,
Prince Rutherford.

14:00.271 --> 14:03.708
I want to talk to you about
something -- what are you doing?

14:03.810 --> 14:07.512
Eh.. Yak snow bed got a
little melty last night.

14:08.214 --> 14:09.447
OK, yeah.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.282
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

14:11.884 --> 14:14.919
You know, these yak snow
beds are the fluffiest

14:15.021 --> 14:15.954
I've ever slept in!

14:16.056 --> 14:17.054
They're so comfortable,

14:17.156 --> 14:19.157
you forget that it's just
a cold block of ice.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.960
And the yak snow
sandwiches, mmm, mmm!

14:22.262 --> 14:23.995
I hate it when food
burns your mouth

14:24.097 --> 14:25.497
or overwhelms
it with flavor.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.366
Oh! Yak hates that too!

14:28.968 --> 14:31.035
You know who would
really, really enjoy

14:31.137 --> 14:32.237
these snow sandwiches?

14:32.739 --> 14:34.806
Twilight Sparkle and
the other ponies!

14:35.208 --> 14:38.276
Oh! Hey, I have an idea!

14:38.778 --> 14:41.279
Why don't I go to Ponyville
and bring them back here?

14:42.081 --> 14:43.848
Ponies like snow sandwich?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.517
Oh! Ponies love snow
sandwiches!

14:46.619 --> 14:48.086
And, hey, while they're here,

14:48.188 --> 14:49.954
you can ask if they'll
clear the snow away.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.090
Fun, right?

14:52.292 --> 14:54.325
When Prince was little yak,

14:54.527 --> 14:56.828
Prince stomped on
ground too hard.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.664
Made deep hole and
fell into hole.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.866
Ice froze over hole.

15:02.168 --> 15:06.237
Prince waved to friends and
family from inside frozen hole.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.106
Waited for spring thaw.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.741
Prince survived on own.

15:11.043 --> 15:12.143
Wait a minute..

15:12.345 --> 15:14.679
You spent the whole
winter in a hole?

15:14.981 --> 15:17.482
Yes. And yak never
ask for help!

15:19.485 --> 15:22.953
OK, first of all, how did you
make such a deep hole

15:23.055 --> 15:23.688
from stomping?

15:23.790 --> 15:25.590
And how did it
freeze over so fast?

15:25.892 --> 15:27.492
And how could you see
your family and friends

15:27.594 --> 15:29.260
to wave to them from
inside a frozen hole?

15:29.362 --> 15:32.496
Even if all that was possible,
how did you breathe in there!?

15:33.665 --> 15:35.733
YAKS DON'T ASK FOR HELP!

15:37.002 --> 15:38.669
But the yaks are hungry!

15:38.871 --> 15:40.638
And who knows when
the snow will melt?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.438
I just don't
understand why--

15:42.540 --> 15:47.412
Ah yes, is clear now that Pink
Pony does not understand Yaks!

15:47.714 --> 15:50.381
Honorary Yak status rescinded!

15:52.417 --> 15:54.318
Bang! Pretend there
is door!

15:54.620 --> 15:56.620
I just slammed it!

15:57.689 --> 15:59.390
Fine, be stubborn!

16:05.598 --> 16:07.999
Oooh! Those yaks are so stubborn!

16:08.101 --> 16:10.501
They refuse to ask for help
even though they need it.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.503
Well, this Official
Friendship Ambassador

16:12.605 --> 16:14.905
is going to take matters
into her own hooves.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.240
I'll show them.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.144
You're right, Gummy.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.444
I am too worked up.

16:21.546 --> 16:24.182
A road trip game would
officially calm me down.

16:24.984 --> 16:25.682
I know!

16:25.784 --> 16:27.952
Let's play "Twenty
Million Questions."

16:28.154 --> 16:29.052
You think of something.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.788
Then I'll ask you twenty
million questions

16:30.890 --> 16:32.957
until I can come up with
what you're thinking of.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.125
Let's go!

16:34.327 --> 16:34.892
Is it blue?

16:34.994 --> 16:35.593
Is it green?

16:35.695 --> 16:36.294
Is it red?

16:36.396 --> 16:37.095
Is it greenish-red?

16:37.197 --> 16:37.995
Is it reddish-blue?

16:38.097 --> 16:39.395
Is it bigger than a bread box?

16:39.497 --> 16:40.595
Is it smaller than a bread box?

16:40.697 --> 16:41.599
Is it a bread box?

16:41.701 --> 16:42.400
Is it bread?

16:42.602 --> 16:43.300
Is it teeth?

16:43.402 --> 16:44.969
Is it Granny Smith's dentures?

16:45.271 --> 16:46.204
Is it you?

16:46.606 --> 16:47.371
Is it a rooster?

16:47.473 --> 16:48.373
Is it a red rooster?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.175
Is it a red rooster eating corn?

16:50.877 --> 16:53.111
Uhp, used up all twenty
million questions.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.679
Oh, well, we're here anyway!

16:58.850 --> 17:01.185
Official Pony
Balloon still here?

17:02.888 --> 17:06.891
Pink Pony gone because Pink
Pony not tough like yaks.

17:08.327 --> 17:09.694
Horn bump in agreement.

17:10.096 --> 17:10.695
Now!

17:16.268 --> 17:16.967
Bleagh!

17:17.069 --> 17:19.103
Snow sandwich lose novelty.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.038
Snow couscous for dinner.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.876
Then Prince Rutherford
said -- Bang!

17:25.978 --> 17:27.545
Pretend there is door!

17:27.647 --> 17:29.013
I just slammed it!

17:29.315 --> 17:30.213
Pinkie Pie--

17:30.315 --> 17:31.549
So then Pink
Pony said --

17:31.751 --> 17:33.518
Fine, be stubborn!

17:34.020 --> 17:36.254
Pinkie Pie, we have
to help the yaks!

17:36.656 --> 17:40.091
So in conclusion, we
have to help the yaks!

17:40.493 --> 17:41.059
Hmm?

17:41.661 --> 17:43.027
Just go with it, hon.

17:43.529 --> 17:44.895
Great idea, Pinkie.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.597
We'll be happy to
help the yaks.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.833
This is what friendship
is all about.

17:49.135 --> 17:50.835
Hey! I'll bring
apples.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.404
This season's batch
are extra juicy.

17:53.706 --> 17:54.972
And I shall provide the yaks

17:55.074 --> 17:57.208
with Equestria's
finest textiles.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.077
They'll be silky and
warm with hints of gold

18:00.179 --> 18:01.512
to compliment their horns.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.313
Stop!

18:02.615 --> 18:05.149
We can't bring the
yaks any pony stuff!

18:05.451 --> 18:06.384
Why not?

18:06.786 --> 18:08.586
The yaks are very proud.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.488
They won't ask for help.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.357
You know what they say, you
can lead a yak to water,

18:13.459 --> 18:15.560
but you better not let
him know you're doing it!

18:15.962 --> 18:17.395
Nopony says that.

18:17.897 --> 18:18.597
Do they?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.399
OK then, this will be an

18:21.501 --> 18:23.401
Official Covert
Friendship Mission.

18:24.025 --> 18:25.025
Rainbow Dash: You got it!
Pinkie Pie: Woohoo!

18:26.238 --> 18:26.804
Pinkie: Is it yellow?

18:27.206 --> 18:27.938
Is it slimy?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.138
Is it slimy-yellow?

18:29.440 --> 18:31.141
Rainbow Dash: We're
not playing that!

18:33.812 --> 18:37.181
First, we have to
infiltrate the yak compound!

18:40.085 --> 18:41.285
These walls are high.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.788
Sneaking in will not be easy.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.365
Or it's super easy
cause I'm awesome.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.501
Go ahead. I'll
catch up!

18:56.803 --> 18:58.437
You all know
what to do!

19:50.790 --> 19:51.523
Oh!

19:52.525 --> 19:53.658
What happened!?

19:54.060 --> 19:55.559
Snow melted.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.295
Prince Rutherford was right!

20:03.169 --> 20:04.935
Aha! Yaks tough!

20:05.237 --> 20:06.704
Yaks wait patiently.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.372
Yaks win!

20:12.277 --> 20:16.280
Whoo-weee, helping to fix
an entire yak village

20:16.382 --> 20:17.949
sure takes a lot out of you.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.550
Let's get out of here
before--

20:19.652 --> 20:21.419
Prince: Oh Pink Pony!

20:24.590 --> 20:26.090
Just play it cool...

20:27.058 --> 20:30.127
We didn't help fix
Yakyakistan! No no!

20:30.329 --> 20:31.727
We're just here for
the snow sandwiches!

20:31.829 --> 20:33.998
But.. then we got here and the
snow's gone so we thought

20:34.100 --> 20:36.301
we'd hit a diner on the way
back to Ponyville. Buh Bye!

20:36.703 --> 20:39.537
Wait! Yak not mad
at Pink Pony.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.005
Yak not?

20:41.207 --> 20:44.242
Pink Pony helped yaks
without yaks asking.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.844
Means Pink Pony understand yaks.

20:47.946 --> 20:48.779
I do?

20:49.081 --> 20:50.915
Hunh! I do!

20:51.317 --> 20:54.385
Pink Pony the best
kind of friend.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.088
Officially Honorary Yak!

20:57.490 --> 20:58.556
Hooray!

20:58.658 --> 20:59.490
Yay!

20:59.592 --> 21:00.791
Pink Pony Honorary Yak!

21:00.893 --> 21:02.260
Yippeeee!

21:02.762 --> 21:05.129
My own Honorary Yak Horns!

21:05.431 --> 21:07.965
Now I can officially horn bump!

21:08.367 --> 21:08.966
[thunk] Oh!

21:11.368 --> 21:15.306
Yeah, you know this<i> is</i> a little
heavy for my small pony head.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.607
Ha ha ha.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.776
Need some help with
that, Pinkie Pie?

21:19.078 --> 21:22.481
Pink Pony no need
Apple Pony's help!

21:25.217 --> 21:26.015
Just kidding!

21:26.117 --> 21:27.952
Pink Pony got Apple Pony good!

21:30.055 --> 21:32.156
Seriously, this is
heavy. [thud]
