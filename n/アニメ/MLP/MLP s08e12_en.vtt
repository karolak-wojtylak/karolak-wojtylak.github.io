WEBVTT

00:09.444 --> 00:10.976
Wha! Whoa!

00:15.549 --> 00:17.383
Almost...there.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.118
Agh!

00:19.220 --> 00:20.738
Ah! I can't wait!

00:20.839 --> 00:24.057
Twilight's School is supposed
to be amazing inside!

00:24.659 --> 00:27.293
Rarity says there's never
been a school like it.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.596
Ah!

00:28.897 --> 00:32.798
I heard the students get to
do tons of awesome stuff!

00:33.100 --> 00:34.466
Do you see anything yet?

00:34.768 --> 00:36.235
Uh, yeah!

00:36.537 --> 00:38.371
It looks like...A BROOM!

00:38.473 --> 00:41.540
And a dustpan...
And some buckets...

00:41.742 --> 00:44.010
That sounds like a closet.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.411
Try another window!

00:50.284 --> 00:51.617
Woah!

00:51.719 --> 00:54.554
Whooooo's ready for cupcakes!?

01:01.696 --> 01:03.362
Oh they're not for you, silly!

01:03.464 --> 01:04.330
They're for sharing!

01:05.833 --> 01:07.132
First, say something nice.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.001
Like this.

01:08.803 --> 01:11.770
Ocellus, you are
a great listener!

01:13.374 --> 01:14.740
Now you get to
keep one cupcake

01:14.842 --> 01:16.809
and share one with
another creature!

01:17.611 --> 01:20.579
Yona, you're really strong!

01:24.986 --> 01:26.618
Whoa!

01:29.957 --> 01:31.423
Wow!

01:33.060 --> 01:37.363
All right students, it's time
to meet some new friends!

01:41.502 --> 01:43.236
Aaaaah!

01:43.838 --> 01:45.504
Applejack: Incoming!

01:47.828 --> 01:48.828
Ha-yah!

01:54.515 --> 01:56.615
That's friendship
in action, y'all.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.489
Wow! And I thought
our school was fun!

02:03.591 --> 02:08.360
Yeah, Miss Cheerilee never
lets us play buckball in class.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.329
I know. I've tried.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.397
Hey!

02:11.499 --> 02:13.599
Why don't we go here instead?

02:13.701 --> 02:15.201
It's still school, right?

02:15.503 --> 02:16.735
Yeah!

02:19.140 --> 02:21.540
[sigh] What could be better
than learning friendship

02:21.642 --> 02:23.443
with your best friends?

02:23.945 --> 02:27.379
Learning friendship with
your best friends and CAKE!

03:10.223 --> 03:10.989
Ahem.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.591
Good morning, class!

03:12.692 --> 03:14.392
Today, we're going to
learn about friendship

03:14.494 --> 03:15.560
through the ages.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.696
Spike? Slide one, please.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.900
Back in the days of
Chancellor Puddinghead--

03:22.602 --> 03:23.835
Uh, Spike?

03:24.237 --> 03:27.205
Huh? Sorry, Twilight.

03:27.307 --> 03:29.040
Still getting used
to my new wings.

03:29.242 --> 03:30.476
They're pretty great, huh?

03:31.078 --> 03:32.143
Yes, Spike.

03:32.245 --> 03:34.414
As I was saying... huh?

03:35.616 --> 03:37.282
What are you
three doing here?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.184
We wanna go to
your school!

03:39.386 --> 03:40.385
But why?

03:40.787 --> 03:41.987
We want to learn
friendship!

03:42.089 --> 03:43.322
And play Buckball!

03:43.724 --> 03:44.923
I see.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.825
Why don't you
three come with me?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.028
Spike? You're in charge.

03:50.030 --> 03:50.829
Yes!

03:54.201 --> 03:55.085
Hi, Twilight!

03:55.286 --> 03:58.670
Looks like you could use a
guidance counsellor's help!

03:58.872 --> 03:59.972
Hint. Hint.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.373
No thanks, Starlight.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.507
I got this.

04:02.609 --> 04:03.676
Great....

04:03.778 --> 04:08.147
Well, I'll just go dust my office
for the seventieth time.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.248
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

04:10.350 --> 04:12.717
but... you can't be
my students.

04:12.819 --> 04:13.752
Why not?

04:13.954 --> 04:17.255
Isn't this place
for EVERY creature?

04:17.357 --> 04:20.292
Yes. But we teach
friendship lessons here.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.561
You already know all about
helping ponies in need

04:22.663 --> 04:24.062
and being there
for each other.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.964
Can't you just give
us a chance?

04:26.266 --> 04:28.233
Please...?

04:28.435 --> 04:30.969
You need Cheerilee's
classes, not mine.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.805
Hurry up! You don't want late
marks on your permanent record!

04:35.075 --> 04:38.543
All: O dragon, my dragon!

04:38.845 --> 04:41.412
Spike..? What did you do?

04:43.450 --> 04:44.049
Ha ha!

04:46.419 --> 04:47.918
Well, I'm not
giving up.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.655
I know we can prove we
belong in this school!

04:50.757 --> 04:53.692
Yeah! Um, how?

04:53.794 --> 04:56.394
By showing Twilight we've
still got lots to learn

04:56.496 --> 04:57.796
about friendship.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.798
And I know just
where to start.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.269
Ugh. What in tarnation?

05:12.445 --> 05:13.429
Apple Bloom!

05:13.530 --> 05:16.314
You know better than to leave
our good tools out like that.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.785
And aren't you supposed to
be on harvest duty right now?

05:20.287 --> 05:23.188
Eh, it's not like the apples
are going anywhere.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.757
What's gotten into you?

05:25.859 --> 05:28.126
Those chores are
your responsibility!

05:28.228 --> 05:30.228
Farm work is family work!

05:30.630 --> 05:32.231
Sorry, Applejack.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.367
Maybe, if I went to
Twilight's School,

05:35.469 --> 05:38.403
I'd learn to be better
at helping the family!

05:39.640 --> 05:43.141
Ah! So that's what
this is all about.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.744
Well, if it's
learning you want,

05:45.846 --> 05:48.847
I'd be happy to give you a
private lesson right now.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.382
Starting with cleanin'
up all this equipment!

05:52.686 --> 05:53.285
Hmph.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.524
Please can I go to
Twilight's school?

06:05.098 --> 06:05.931
Please?

06:11.504 --> 06:12.371
PLEASE?

06:12.473 --> 06:14.139
I'm going to call
you Repeatie Bell!

06:14.241 --> 06:15.007
We've been through this.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.674
Please let me concentrate!

06:19.312 --> 06:20.012
How about now?

06:21.114 --> 06:24.583
So there I was, leading the
Wonderbolt formation

06:24.685 --> 06:29.087
into a super-dangerous sundog
spiral, when suddenly

06:31.625 --> 06:34.626
there was a HUGE storm
cloud in our way!

06:34.728 --> 06:35.694
What happened?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.729
My genius happened!

06:37.931 --> 06:40.265
I changed the
routine on the fly.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.969
And because my crew are such
tight friends, they followed me!

06:44.071 --> 06:45.904
[gasp] What did you do!?

06:46.006 --> 06:48.540
Only the coolest thing ever.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.675
I flew up-
-and did a super-amazing half twist

06:50.777 --> 06:52.512
into a backflip sonic rainboom!

06:53.714 --> 06:57.783
Hey, I never told that story
to my students before...

06:59.085 --> 07:00.485
SCOOTALOO..

07:02.689 --> 07:03.656
Never met her.

07:04.858 --> 07:05.691
Aw.

07:12.032 --> 07:12.630
They're coming!

07:12.732 --> 07:13.465
Get ready!

07:23.476 --> 07:24.676
Look out!

07:29.351 --> 07:29.984
Oof!

07:31.285 --> 07:33.418
Hey! Watch where you are going!

07:34.021 --> 07:38.824
I was watching, watching
you drive like a crazy pony!

07:39.026 --> 07:42.994
Well, maybe if you did not drop
apples all over the street,

07:43.096 --> 07:44.963
I would not have to!

07:45.365 --> 07:49.200
Oh, I've never seen Apple Bloom
and Scootaloo argue like this.

07:49.302 --> 07:53.037
Yeah, they usually go together
like candy canes and stripes.

07:55.876 --> 07:56.941
Whoa!

07:57.744 --> 07:59.210
My apples!

07:59.312 --> 08:01.580
This is all your
fault, Scootaloo!

08:01.682 --> 08:04.382
Hey! Sweetie Belle
is the clumsy one.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.654
I'm not talking to either
one of you ever again!

08:09.156 --> 08:12.424
Goodness! They
seem really upset!

08:12.626 --> 08:15.795
It's almost like they
forgot they're friends!

08:16.897 --> 08:18.597
I think it's working.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.266
You are so careless!

08:21.768 --> 08:23.068
Good plan, Apple Bloom!

08:23.570 --> 08:24.737
Careless!

08:24.838 --> 08:28.205
I will show you who is
the one who is careless.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.442
And great acting,
Sweetie Belle.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.110
We're an awesome team!

08:32.212 --> 08:34.345
All right!
Pinkie Pie: Yay!

08:34.847 --> 08:35.446
Oops.

08:35.548 --> 08:36.715
You're friends again!

08:36.817 --> 08:38.216
I knew you would be!

08:39.186 --> 08:41.752
Candy cane stripes forever!

08:47.027 --> 08:49.794
Now they'll never let us
into Twilight's school.

08:56.503 --> 09:00.505
OK, we've tried shirkin'
chores, pesterin',

09:00.607 --> 09:02.274
disguises, fightin'...

09:02.376 --> 09:05.210
Hmm. We need to
do something new.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.711
Something unexpected.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.682
Great idea, Scootaloo!

09:10.784 --> 09:12.784
We haven't tried crying yet!

09:12.886 --> 09:15.754
Yeah! It always
works for Rarity!

09:16.456 --> 09:17.622
I wasn't crying.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.190
I think it's coming
from outside!

09:24.898 --> 09:27.232
Aw, she looks so sad!

09:27.534 --> 09:29.200
We better go see what's wrong.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.806
Hey, are you OK?

09:35.808 --> 09:37.575
Oh, thank you for asking.

09:37.677 --> 09:38.643
But no.

09:38.945 --> 09:40.812
I'm having real trouble with

09:42.149 --> 09:43.983
the School of Friendship.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.385
Twilight won't let
you go either, huh?

09:47.487 --> 09:49.421
Oh, no, It's not that.

09:49.523 --> 09:53.624
I'm in her class but
[sob] it's too HARD!

09:54.861 --> 09:55.694
Really?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.130
I just moved here
to go to school,

09:59.232 --> 10:02.433
but everything's so
new and different.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.569
I don't know anypony!

10:04.971 --> 10:06.437
Well, now you do!

10:06.639 --> 10:07.622
I'm Apple Bloom.

10:07.723 --> 10:09.406
This is Sweetie
Belle and Scootaloo.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.577
We're the Cutie
Mark Crusaders!

10:11.979 --> 10:13.912
[sniff] I'm Cozy Glow.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.147
It's very nice to
meet you.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.783
But I don't know
if I'll stay long.

10:18.885 --> 10:22.654
I'll probably flunk out; I'm
having so much trouble

10:22.756 --> 10:24.789
with my friendship lessons.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.358
We can help with those!

10:27.460 --> 10:29.194
We know all about friendship!

10:29.296 --> 10:31.296
And studying with you
would be almost as good

10:31.398 --> 10:32.597
as being in class!

10:32.799 --> 10:35.067
But why would you help me?

10:35.669 --> 10:38.036
What's in it for you?

10:38.238 --> 10:39.938
That's how
friendship works.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.341
When you give from your heart,
you don't expect anything back.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.709
Well, golly!

10:44.811 --> 10:46.144
If you really mean it,

10:46.246 --> 10:47.062
Mm hm!

10:47.163 --> 10:49.379
I could use some help
with my homework.

10:50.551 --> 10:54.052
I have to do something nice
for each of these ponies.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.855
But I don't know
anything about them.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.759
And it's so hard to talk
to ponies you've never met.

11:00.961 --> 11:01.894
Well, you're in luck.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.128
'Cause we know all
those ponies!

11:04.231 --> 11:06.764
Get ready for a
friendship A plus!

11:12.939 --> 11:14.272
That's Bon Bon.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.007
If you wanna do
something nice for her,

11:16.109 --> 11:18.043
first you gotta figure
out what she needs.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.345
How am I supposed
to do that?

11:20.647 --> 11:21.980
Just pay attention.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.349
Friendship is about
listening to others.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.319
Oh. Ow.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.656
Uh oh. That cactus
keeps pricking her

11:31.758 --> 11:33.192
every step she takes!

11:33.393 --> 11:37.027
Hmm. If only there was something to
protect her from those spines.

11:40.277 --> 11:40.777
Yah!

11:42.102 --> 11:44.235
It looks like you need
help carrying your cactus

11:44.337 --> 11:46.771
so here's a safe way
to take it home. [giggle]

11:46.873 --> 11:47.872
Thank you!

11:48.174 --> 11:50.208
That's so thoughtful!

11:53.113 --> 11:53.978
I did it!

11:54.180 --> 11:55.280
Good job!

11:55.382 --> 11:56.681
But, uh, next time?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.450
Maybe don't give away my helmet.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.118
Oopsie.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.187
♪♪

12:03.289 --> 12:05.356
Green. Purple. Yellow.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.192
Aaand one more purple.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.561
Whew. Sorting all those took
longer than I thought!

12:12.699 --> 12:16.534
You really think Mrs. Cake will
like these new sprinkle shakers?

12:16.636 --> 12:19.938
Mm hm! Now she won't have to use
rainbow sprinkles all the time.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.772
She can just pick
the color she wants!

12:22.909 --> 12:25.577
Oh, I'm sorry, I
was out to lunch.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.712
Were you fillies
waiting for me long?

12:27.814 --> 12:30.281
No. Um. These
are for you.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.386
Ooh well, what a lovely surprise!

12:35.488 --> 12:37.155
I can't wait to try them out!

12:39.993 --> 12:42.460
Look! I made rainbow sprinkles!

12:42.662 --> 12:44.295
Aren't they wonderful?

12:45.632 --> 12:47.532
But...she...I...

12:48.602 --> 12:51.069
At least she likes
her present?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.337
Uh huh.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.726
Golly! How'd you know that
would make him so happy?

13:14.828 --> 13:17.962
Friendship means pitching in to
help others' chores go faster.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.501
Specially when their special
somepony's waiting for 'em.

13:31.044 --> 13:31.910
Ugh.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.813
That class was sooo boring!

13:34.915 --> 13:37.482
Not even Miss Cheerilee
can make the history

13:37.584 --> 13:39.284
of radishes exciting.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.352
I bet they don't have to
learn about that stuff

13:41.454 --> 13:42.587
at Twilight's school.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.292
Guess what!

13:47.394 --> 13:49.961
I got an A on my homework!

13:50.363 --> 13:51.562
All right!
Nice goin'!

13:51.800 --> 13:55.434
And I never could have
done it without your help.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.368
No problem!

13:57.470 --> 13:59.137
We just wish we
could've done more.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.506
Actually, you can.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.675
Headmare Twilight is
giving us a big test

14:04.777 --> 14:05.928
at the end of the week.

14:06.029 --> 14:08.880
And I could really use
your help studying.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.752
We wanted to go to Twilight's
school more than anything,

14:13.854 --> 14:16.387
but helping you has
been even more fun.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.356
You can count on us!

14:38.411 --> 14:40.378
Um, intelligence?

15:18.751 --> 15:19.784
Laughter?

15:19.986 --> 15:20.819
Yes!

15:21.721 --> 15:24.422
Is it.... control?

15:53.320 --> 16:00.291
Kindness, loyalty, honesty,
generosity, laughter, magic!

16:00.993 --> 16:02.926
Yes!
Woo hoo!

16:13.973 --> 16:14.873
How'd the test go?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.274
Were there essay
questions?

16:16.376 --> 16:17.842
Did you remember
what we taught you?

16:18.444 --> 16:21.512
I......... FAILED!

16:24.784 --> 16:27.852
But how could Cozy Glow
fail her friendship test?

16:28.054 --> 16:28.754
Twilight: Ahem.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.623
I'd like to see you
three in my office.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.867
I know we wanted to
be invited inside,

16:43.069 --> 16:45.236
but it kinda went
different in my head.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.073
I can't believe you'd
do something like this.

16:49.775 --> 16:51.176
Like.. what?

16:52.078 --> 16:54.579
You ARE Cozy Glow's
tutors, aren't you?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.280
We've been working
with her for days!

16:56.382 --> 16:57.916
That's what she told me.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.951
So you've been setting
her up to fail?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.353
How?      What?
Huh?

17:01.454 --> 17:04.054
I know you're upset that I
won't let you come to my school.

17:04.157 --> 17:07.191
But to teach Cozy all the
wrong things out of spite,

17:07.493 --> 17:08.693
that's just cruel.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.329
But we taught her
all the right things!

17:11.831 --> 17:14.432
Then how do you explain these
friendship test answers?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.734
What are the six
elements of harmony?

17:16.836 --> 17:19.070
Five turtlenecks
and a cheese grater?

17:19.172 --> 17:20.838
Who is the Princess
of Friendship?

17:20.940 --> 17:21.873
Your mom!?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.208
I-I don't understand....

17:24.310 --> 17:25.077
Me neither.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.845
I never thought you three
would pull such a mean prank.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.314
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you

17:29.416 --> 17:30.981
to stay away from
my school...

17:31.083 --> 17:32.483
and my students.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.092
Oh, no!

17:45.810 --> 17:46.710
Hmm!

17:49.035 --> 17:49.835
[sarcastic] Yay.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.636
Now I'll alphabetize
them in reverse order.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.640
[sigh] Not much need for
a guidance counselor

17:55.742 --> 17:57.108
at a School of Friendship.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.609
Cozy Glow: Ahem!
Ah!

17:59.378 --> 18:00.844
H-How much of that
did you hear!?

18:01.147 --> 18:01.746
Never mind.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.817
Heh. Welcome!

18:06.119 --> 18:07.652
Can I get you a comfort pillow?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.086
Security blanket?

18:09.288 --> 18:10.689
Empathy cocoa?

18:12.291 --> 18:14.358
I just need some advice.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.460
Oh! Well, I have
plenty of that!

18:16.762 --> 18:19.363
Anecdotes, insight,
midnight confessions...

18:19.665 --> 18:20.398
I'm babbling.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.702
Ahem. Go ahead. I'm... listening.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.138
I think I got my
friends in trouble.

18:27.240 --> 18:31.776
They helped me study for my
friendship test and I failed it.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.678
On purpose.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.780
Tch. Why would you do that!?

18:36.182 --> 18:38.149
Uh.... sorry, listening.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.519
Well, the Cutie Mark Crusaders
wanted to go to this school

18:41.621 --> 18:42.987
more than anything.

18:43.089 --> 18:47.024
So I thought if I showed
Headmare Twilight

18:47.126 --> 18:50.928
they're bad at friendship, she'd
let them come here with me!

18:51.230 --> 18:52.863
That's devious!

18:52.965 --> 18:54.932
I mean...I see.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.669
I guess I still have a lot
to learn about friendship.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.707
Actually, I think
you're doing all right.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.309
Sure, that was a
really, really bad way

19:05.411 --> 19:06.977
to try to help
your friends.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.581
But what matters
is, you wanted to.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.350
The reason the Cutie Mark
Crusaders don't go to this

19:12.452 --> 19:15.486
school is that they'd make
better teachers than students!

19:15.588 --> 19:17.922
So you DO have a
place for them here?

19:18.624 --> 19:19.490
Hmmm.

19:25.798 --> 19:29.066
Hmph. I bet there's no Wonderful
World of Cleaning lesson

19:29.168 --> 19:30.868
at Twilight's school.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.472
We'll never find out now.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.043
I still don't get how
Cozy failed her test

19:39.145 --> 19:41.011
after all that studying!

19:41.113 --> 19:43.681
Or how Twilight could
blame us for it!

19:43.783 --> 19:46.150
Or how gum can be so sticky!

19:47.987 --> 19:49.921
Sorry to interrupt,
Miss Cheerilee,

19:50.023 --> 19:53.591
but can I borrow Apple Bloom,
Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?

20:05.405 --> 20:07.872
We didn't do anything
wrong, we promise!

20:08.174 --> 20:10.041
I know that. Now.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.076
Which is why I wanted
to talk to you.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.979
Wait. So we're
not in trouble?

20:15.081 --> 20:16.298
Just the opposite.

20:16.399 --> 20:19.016
Cozy Glow, is there
something you'd like to say?

20:19.318 --> 20:21.719
This is all my fault.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.422
I messed up my
test on purpose,

20:24.524 --> 20:26.824
so we could all go
to school together!

20:26.926 --> 20:28.259
I'm sorry.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.328
Thank you, Cozy Glow.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.530
Honesty is one of the
pillars of friendship.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.432
But you already know that.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.534
Which is why I'd like
to give you these.

20:37.558 --> 20:38.258
Oof!

20:43.043 --> 20:45.243
They're honorary diplomas,

20:45.345 --> 20:48.613
making y'all official
graduates of this here school.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.948
You've more than
earned them.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.083
Without even
having to study!

20:59.158 --> 21:01.158
Yeah!

21:01.360 --> 21:06.864
We are grad-u-ates!
We are grad-u-ates!

21:07.066 --> 21:09.767
And, if you're interested, I
think Starlight has a place

21:09.869 --> 21:11.636
for you at my school after all.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.255
Really?
Wooo hooo!

21:13.356 --> 21:15.873
We could use some good
friendship tutors on staff.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.142
And I hear you're
the best out there.

21:18.644 --> 21:20.310
Then what're we
waiting for?

21:20.412 --> 21:21.879
Let's get tutoring!

21:22.481 --> 21:23.982
C'mon, Cozy!

21:24.484 --> 21:28.519
And THAT's why this school needs
you as our guidance counselor.
