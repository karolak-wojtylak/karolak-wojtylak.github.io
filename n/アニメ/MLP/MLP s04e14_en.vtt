00:05.193 --> 00:09.586
Oh, good morning little friends,
your singing is oh so pretty.

00:10.246 --> 00:12.326
Yes, it is a very
beautiful day today,

00:12.653 --> 00:14.826
certainly something
worth singing about.

00:15.353 --> 00:19.293
♪ There's music in the treetops
and there's music in the vale. ♪

00:19.626 --> 00:23.460
<i>♪ and all around me</i>
<i>music fills the sky ♪</i>

00:23.966 --> 00:25.866
<i>♪ There's music by the river </i>

00:26.006 --> 00:28.060
<i>♪ and there's music</i>

00:28.193 --> 00:32.393

00:57.353 --> 01:00.800
Oh, thank you so much.
You're too kind.

01:01.635 --> 01:03.116
<i>WOW!</i>

01:06.387 --> 01:11.088
Oh. You um, you didn't
hear me, um ...

01:11.571 --> 01:13.673
Singing in the most
beautiful voice ever?

01:13.862 --> 01:15.456
Uh, yeah we did!

01:25.806 --> 01:30.800
Subtitles by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu

01:59.651 --> 02:03.593
Wow! I've never heard you
sing a solo like that before.

02:04.051 --> 02:06.396
It was like a little
slice of heaven.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.633
With ice cream on top!

02:09.212 --> 02:12.912
Fluttershy, I cannot believe
your spectacular voice

02:12.947 --> 02:15.228
isn't part of the
Pony Tones Quartet!

02:15.782 --> 02:17.622
Um...well...I...

02:17.676 --> 02:19.408
Especially since you're
having us perform

02:19.433 --> 02:22.019
for your Ponyville Pet Center
Fundraiser tomorrow night!

02:22.803 --> 02:24.934
Well, you see, I...

02:25.014 --> 02:27.219
This simply must be rectified!

02:27.430 --> 02:29.824
You must share that
stunning voice at the event.

02:29.913 --> 02:31.936
Yeah! It will be so amazing!

02:32.153 --> 02:34.793
You'd be there on stage,
basking in the hooflights,

02:34.800 --> 02:38.076
the center of attention,
a shining star...

02:38.220 --> 02:40.979
<i>With everypony staring</i>
<i>at you, judging you,</i>

02:41.024 --> 02:43.529
jealously noting how they
could be WAY better than you.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.632
Why wasn't it them?
Why wasn't it them?

02:45.737 --> 02:48.035
<i>And then, when you choke,</i>
<i>they'll turn on you</i>

02:48.044 --> 02:49.660
becoming a seething angry mob

02:49.830 --> 02:51.388
and you'll be horribly
humiliated,

02:51.644 --> 02:54.582
never able to show your
face in Ponyville again!

02:54.729 --> 02:58.393
Pinkie Pie! Don't
be ridiculous!

02:59.337 --> 03:00.700
But I'm so good at it!

03:01.792 --> 03:02.844
Come, Fluttershy.

03:02.988 --> 03:06.025
You will join the group making
the Pony Tones Quartet

03:06.313 --> 03:08.112
the Pony Tones Quintet!

03:08.662 --> 03:09.360
No!

03:09.971 --> 03:11.024
Pardon me?

03:11.523 --> 03:13.174
I love the Pony Tones.

03:13.414 --> 03:14.934
I'm one of their biggest fans.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.424
But I do not want to
perform with them.

03:17.907 --> 03:19.286
Why not, Fluttershy?

03:19.635 --> 03:26.729
Well you see, I...I
have...um...I-I have...

03:26.918 --> 03:27.644
Spit it out!

03:28.588 --> 03:31.126
I have...stage fright!

03:32.598 --> 03:33.692
Is it contagious?

03:34.099 --> 03:36.297
Stage fright isn't
a disease, Pinkie.

03:36.646 --> 03:38.806
It just means that Fluttershy
is scared to perform

03:38.819 --> 03:39.884
in front of everypony.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.016
I'm very thankful
the Pony Tones

03:42.028 --> 03:43.961
are singing at the Pet
Center Fundraiser.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.646
<i>And I'm really looking</i>
<i>forward to the performance.</i>

03:47.004 --> 03:49.564
But I'll be watching
safely from the audience.

03:50.336 --> 03:54.288
Well, I think it's a terrible
waste of an exquisite talent,

03:54.752 --> 03:56.563
but I understand that
you're not comfortable.

03:57.312 --> 03:57.993
Thank you.

03:58.675 --> 03:59.881
Ooh! Angel's right!

04:00.048 --> 04:00.995
We better get going!

04:01.232 --> 04:03.817
There's a lot of work to
do before tomorrow's event!

04:16.499 --> 04:17.318
Ahem!

04:17.392 --> 04:20.713
All right, Pony Tones, let's
run through that again!

04:31.366 --> 04:35.228
♪ Everypony's saying you should
<i>learn to express your voice. ♪</i>

04:35.235 --> 04:38.336

Whoo hoo! Yeah!

04:54.678 --> 04:56.265
Rarity, you were awesome!

04:57.148 --> 05:00.230
Thank you, Spike, but
this is an ensemble.

05:02.118 --> 05:04.249
Enh, the rest of you
were pretty good, too.

05:04.950 --> 05:08.240
Oh, I thought you were all
amazing, Pony Tones.

05:08.633 --> 05:09.804
Thanks, Fluttershy!

05:10.281 --> 05:12.800
Now, Pony Tones, I want you
all to rest your voices

05:12.828 --> 05:13.843
for the remainder of the day.

05:14.041 --> 05:16.326
We'll do a final run-through
tomorrow before the big event.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.075
All right?

05:17.344 --> 05:17.897
Eeyup.

05:18.265 --> 05:19.180
Sounds great!

05:19.846 --> 05:22.793
Oh, Rarity, the Pony Tones
are really going to make

05:22.803 --> 05:25.747
the Ponyville Pet Center
Fundraiser so special!

05:26.054 --> 05:29.472
Thank you so much for
helping me help the animals!

05:29.513 --> 05:32.665
Oh yes. It is wonderful
when a plan comes together

05:32.678 --> 05:34.822
without any sort of
drama, isn't it?

05:55.910 --> 05:57.100
Morning, Fluttershy.

05:57.472 --> 05:59.331
Good morning,
Pony Tones!

05:59.574 --> 06:02.819
Actually, we're the Pony
Tones minus one tone.

06:03.056 --> 06:05.392
Big Mac is
inconveniently late.

06:11.923 --> 06:12.985
Well, there you are!

06:13.228 --> 06:15.062
Have I not told you
about punctuality?

06:15.513 --> 06:17.456
Ah! I don't want
to hear it!

06:29.904 --> 06:32.422
Big Mac! Can you please
start the song?

06:34.179 --> 06:35.292
Nnope.

06:35.577 --> 06:36.214
Big Mac!

06:36.576 --> 06:37.664
Did you lose your voice?

06:38.496 --> 06:39.536
Eeyup.

06:45.987 --> 06:48.380
Whatever did you
do to cause this?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.041
Well...

06:51.977 --> 06:53.161
Howdy, everypony!

06:53.299 --> 06:56.521
And welcome to the 12th Annual
Ponyville Turkey Call!

07:00.320 --> 07:01.708
Who will take the
title this year?

07:02.009 --> 07:03.251
Will it be somepony new?

07:03.475 --> 07:06.710
Or will the Turkey Call
champion of six years

07:06.720 --> 07:10.672
<i>defend his title to make</i>
<i>it lucky number seven?</i>

07:11.270 --> 07:13.715
We'll find out if
ya stop yer gabbin'

07:13.720 --> 07:16.034
and git on with
the gobblin'!

07:16.172 --> 07:17.507
All right, everypony!

07:17.852 --> 07:19.203
Let's talk turkey!

07:19.654 --> 07:21.459
Big Mac, yer up!

07:25.211 --> 07:27.979
A Turkey Call?

07:28.124 --> 07:31.577
You lost your voice
doing a...Turkey Call?

07:31.942 --> 07:33.952
Lost his voice and the title!

07:36.689 --> 07:38.690
Now we can't
perform tonight.

07:38.755 --> 07:40.729
Wait! What? No!

07:42.288 --> 07:43.372
You have to perform!

07:43.587 --> 07:46.006
Otherwise the fundraiser
will be a disaster.

07:46.432 --> 07:48.848
Well, we cannot perform
tonight with only three voices.

07:49.171 --> 07:50.089
Why not?

07:50.387 --> 07:52.486
It would take rearranging
all the music

07:52.500 --> 07:53.673
and we just don't have time.

07:53.945 --> 07:56.073
<i>I'm sorry, Fluttershy,</i>
<i>but I have no remedy</i>

07:56.083 --> 07:57.094
<i>for this situation.</i>

07:58.937 --> 07:59.977
Of course!

08:00.195 --> 08:01.001
A remedy!

08:01.289 --> 08:02.060
Follow me!

08:08.438 --> 08:11.244
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

08:11.292 --> 08:12.192
Hmmm.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.336
Aaahh.

08:16.358 --> 08:18.835
I can cure this
pony that is hoarse,

08:18.999 --> 08:21.700
but it will take
a longer course.

08:22.240 --> 08:22.979
Come again?

08:23.260 --> 08:23.846
Hmmm.

08:24.201 --> 08:26.672
I can mix a brew that
will work just right,

08:27.274 --> 08:29.841
but it cannot heal
him by tonight.

08:29.948 --> 08:30.896
Oh no!

08:31.961 --> 08:33.734
Where are we ever going
to find a deep voice

08:33.744 --> 08:35.308
to replace Big Mac's?

08:37.684 --> 08:40.852
Pardon me, Zecora,
but this is no laughing matter.

08:40.860 --> 08:43.088
We need a bass voice for
the harmonies to work!

08:43.158 --> 08:45.290
Without it, the
performance will be ruined!

08:45.424 --> 08:47.827
Please forgive my
strange elation,

08:47.928 --> 08:51.129
but I was not laughing
at your situation.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.038
Then what?

08:52.400 --> 08:55.686
Remember when you pony folk
stumbled into Poison Joke?

08:56.198 --> 08:59.180
<i>Miss Fluttershy had</i>
<i>an unusual change,</i>

08:59.315 --> 09:01.216
<i>deepening her vocal range.</i>

09:01.683 --> 09:03.545
I don't want to
talk about it.

09:05.401 --> 09:06.390
Yes, yes!

09:06.982 --> 09:09.510
Your voice became really
low, making it sound like...

09:10.406 --> 09:11.427
Flutterguy!

09:11.880 --> 09:14.112
With these leaves,
I can mix a brew

09:14.128 --> 09:16.665
creating the same
effect on you.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.990
Zecora, that's fantastic!

09:19.110 --> 09:20.713
Yes! I'll do it!

09:20.894 --> 09:23.328
I'd do anything for the animals!

09:23.497 --> 09:26.086
Why, you'd even
appear on stage!

09:26.553 --> 09:27.888
Oh, except that.

09:29.763 --> 09:31.961
I just can't bring
myself to sing on stage

09:31.974 --> 09:33.324
in front of everypony.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.358
What if you sang NOT
in front of everypony?

09:38.822 --> 09:39.350
Huh?

09:39.612 --> 09:42.752
What if Big Mac was on
stage moving his lips

09:42.816 --> 09:46.151
while you're behind the
curtain singing his part?

09:46.246 --> 09:48.051
It would be just like
singing in your house.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.817
<i>Nopony would know it was you.</i>

09:50.377 --> 09:53.449
Even still. I just don't think
I could sing in front of--

09:53.459 --> 09:55.689
You must! For the animals!

09:58.857 --> 10:03.798
Oh, OK, then...mix it up.

10:11.564 --> 10:13.782
Now do it just
like we practiced.

10:25.664 --> 10:28.192
Good evening,
citizens of Ponyville!

10:28.614 --> 10:30.608
I want to thank you all
for coming out tonight

10:30.656 --> 10:33.494
and generously supporting

10:43.289 --> 10:45.494

pony hates the spotlight.

Pony Tones!

12:28.450 --> 12:31.182
That was truly amazing!

12:31.264 --> 12:33.798
And you sounded better
than ever, big brother!

12:36.089 --> 12:38.456
Fluttershy, you were on the
wrong side of the curtain!

12:38.560 --> 12:40.166
You totally missed the show!

12:42.249 --> 12:45.968
Just like a true professional,
Fluttershy was back stage

12:45.980 --> 12:47.926
making sure everything
ran smoothly.

12:48.464 --> 12:49.795
And it was perfect!

12:50.972 --> 12:53.440
That was fantastic, Pony Tones.

12:53.590 --> 12:56.374
My new puppy and I thought it
was super duper crazy good!

12:57.203 --> 12:58.684
Why, thank you!

13:01.827 --> 13:04.035
And we were wondering if you
would consider performing

13:04.067 --> 13:05.888

Zippoorwhill's Cuteciñera.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.418

Amazing Pony Tones!

14:03.210 --> 14:05.356
And it would be even more
amazing if you could perform

14:05.369 --> 14:08.300
at my ribbon-cutting
ceremony tomorrow!

14:09.415 --> 14:12.283
Oh, Mayor, we would
love to but...

14:15.638 --> 14:17.436
Will you excuse us
for a second, Mayor?

14:17.657 --> 14:18.643
Certainly.

14:21.404 --> 14:22.768
Don't
worry, Fluttershy.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.208
You don't have to
perform again.

14:24.627 --> 14:27.212
But we wouldn't
want to disappoint the Mayor.

14:29.860 --> 14:31.868
Well then Mayor,

14:33.347 --> 14:36.137
the Pony Tones will happily perform
at your ceremony!

15:47.833 --> 15:48.733

It's just...I didn't know
that last performance

16:01.633 --> 16:04.613
was my last  performance.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.199
Fluttershy! Stop!

16:10.493 --> 16:13.530
Would it be OK if Fluttershy
sang for you one last time?

16:17.620 --> 16:18.386
Yup.

Big Mac!

17:15.600 --> 17:17.333
You got some 'splainin' to do!

17:18.206 --> 17:19.686
Turkey call?
Eeyup.

17:19.733 --> 17:20.686
Trash yer voice?
Eeyup.

17:20.733 --> 17:21.953
Zecora remedy?
Eeyup.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.026
Not quick enough?
Nope.

17:23.113 --> 17:24.560
Needed a deep voice?
Eeyup.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.733
Poison Joke?
Eeyup.

17:25.826 --> 17:27.006
Flutterguy?
Eeyup.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.060
Better now?
Eeyup.

17:28.206 --> 17:30.013
And that shy filly was living
her dream in the shadows

17:30.026 --> 17:30.946
because she couldn't
bring herself

17:30.953 --> 17:31.900
to come into the
spotlight?

17:32.218 --> 17:33.217
Eeyup.

17:33.573 --> 17:34.973
Well, for corn's sake!

17:35.133 --> 17:35.886
Let's go!

17:37.746 --> 17:38.940
<i>Fluttershy?</i>

17:39.700 --> 17:40.640
You in here?

17:41.206 --> 17:41.693
Yes.

17:42.733 --> 17:43.613
I'm here.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.893
<i>That was totally</i>
<i>unbelievable!</i>

17:46.080 --> 17:48.486
I mean, the curtain came
up, and there you were,

17:48.666 --> 17:50.413
singing in front of everypony!

17:50.553 --> 17:52.480
And, you know, I don't think
any pony was jealous

17:52.573 --> 17:54.853
cause there certainly
wasn't an angry mob!

17:55.033 --> 17:57.300
But it must have been horrible
standing there on stage!

17:57.400 --> 18:00.040
All eyes glued directly on you.

18:00.113 --> 18:03.293
It's like you were living your
own personal worst nightmare!

18:05.546 --> 18:06.493
It was!

18:11.380 --> 18:12.973
What? Too much?

18:14.920 --> 18:17.720
What Pinkie meant to say was
that you were really great.

18:18.173 --> 18:20.026
Wait! Didn't I say that?

18:20.253 --> 18:21.273
Hardly!

18:21.613 --> 18:22.113
Whoops!

18:22.180 --> 18:24.160
YOU WERE GREAT!

18:24.446 --> 18:27.133
You totally blew
my mind!

18:28.060 --> 18:29.440
Incredible!

18:30.893 --> 18:34.753
Though, no offence, you
kind of sounded like a dude.

18:36.926 --> 18:39.486
A great sounding dude!

18:42.780 --> 18:44.560
Well, thank you all.

18:44.926 --> 18:46.300
I'm glad you enjoyed it...

18:48.646 --> 18:51.313
...because I'm never going to
sing in front of anypony

18:51.426 --> 18:52.500
ever again.

18:53.726 --> 18:54.340
Oh no!

18:54.446 --> 18:55.480
Are you kidding me?

18:55.760 --> 18:57.940
Can we please
stop running!

19:01.340 --> 19:04.440
I just don't understand
why, Fluttershy.

19:04.666 --> 19:07.260
<i>After all, you're the one</i>
<i>that wanted the Pony Tones</i>

19:07.273 --> 19:10.346
to sing for every silly
thing that was requested of us.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.593
You mean, you knew I
really wanted to perform?

19:13.993 --> 19:15.500
Of course I knew!

19:16.093 --> 19:16.926
Oh.

19:17.306 --> 19:20.666
And for all her babbling, Pinkie
Pie was right about one thing.

19:21.140 --> 19:22.140
Only one?

19:22.833 --> 19:26.426
When that curtain fell, and
everypony saw you singing,

19:26.620 --> 19:29.073
you lived your worst nightmare.

19:29.686 --> 19:30.760
Was it really that bad?

19:31.446 --> 19:32.386
Yes!

19:32.626 --> 19:34.533
Well, what was so bad about it?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.346
The thunderous
applause?

19:36.653 --> 19:38.493
The praise for your
fantastic singin'?

19:38.706 --> 19:41.453

20:40.086 --> 20:41.746
See? That
wasn't so bad.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.146
And you didn't look completely
petrified by the fact

20:44.153 --> 20:45.800
that we're all staring

20:48.100 --> 20:49.153

Apple Family's Zap Apple
Jam Extraordinaire!

20:59.133 --> 21:02.013
Oh no! I couldn't
do that!

21:04.386 --> 21:06.346
Why not?
How come?
Seriously?

21:06.913 --> 21:08.353
I'll get there someday.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.000
But for now, baby
steps, everypony.

21:11.293 --> 21:12.260
Baby steps.

21:22.253 --> 21:23.520
<i>from your true self.</i>

21:24.133 --> 21:26.373
<i>It's much better to</i>
<i>face those fears</i>

21:26.586 --> 21:31.120
so you can shine and be the best
