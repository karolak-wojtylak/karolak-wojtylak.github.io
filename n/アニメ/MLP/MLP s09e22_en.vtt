WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:06.105
I can't believe we're going
to the Appleoosa County Fair!

00:06.807 --> 00:09.208
Animal shows,
carnival rides...

00:09.310 --> 00:11.043
And all kinds of
food on a stick!

00:12.246 --> 00:14.946
Speaking of food, did you
pack snacks for the train?

00:15.816 --> 00:17.182
For there AND back.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.584
And our train
tickets are all set.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.991
And I've got our whole
itinerary planned!

00:26.293 --> 00:28.927
Are you sure you're
not <i>Twilight's</i> sister?

00:30.798 --> 00:33.065
Weeks of planning has
all come down to this.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.867
All we have to do now is wait
for our chaperone to get here.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.002
Mm hm!

00:37.104 --> 00:42.074
<i> ♪ [musical clock ticking] ♪</i>

00:42.176 --> 00:44.075
So when's Rainbow
Dash coming?

00:44.277 --> 00:46.445
I thought you were
gonna ask Applejack.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.215
I don't suppose
you asked Rarity?

00:49.517 --> 00:52.184
You mean we spent all
this time planning a trip

00:52.286 --> 00:55.487
and none of us asked
anypony to take us!?

00:55.589 --> 00:58.790
In our defense, every
<i>other</i> part of the trip

00:58.892 --> 01:00.525
was planned really well...

01:41.535 --> 01:43.402
We really did think
of everything,

01:43.504 --> 01:45.537
except finding
somepony to take us

01:45.639 --> 01:47.172
and the fair is
only today!

01:47.374 --> 01:50.642
I'm sorry, darlings, but I
can't possibly go to Appleoosa.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.445
I promised to deliver a new
design to Fancy Pants for his

01:53.547 --> 01:56.281
Monocle and Top Hat
Appreciation Society Soiree.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.451
Can't you finish
it tomorrow?

02:00.353 --> 02:03.021
Well, I could, but you'll
learn as you get older

02:03.123 --> 02:04.823
how important it is to
keep your promises,

02:04.925 --> 02:07.025
especially when
running a business.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.195
Maybe we should just
go by ourselves?

02:10.297 --> 02:11.997
WHAT? Oh, my dear, no!

02:12.099 --> 02:14.633
Appleoosa is far too long a
train ride for young foals

02:14.735 --> 02:16.135
without accompaniment!

02:16.237 --> 02:18.337
You could end up in the
wrong place entirely.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.372
Why don't you see if
Rainbow Dash is free?

02:21.074 --> 02:24.309
Sorry, but I just heard from
Spitfire that a whole bunch of

02:24.411 --> 02:26.278
storm clouds got loose
from the cloud factory

02:26.380 --> 02:28.614
and she needs every
Wonderbolt to help bust 'em.

02:28.816 --> 02:32.884
Aw, come on Rainbow Dash,
they won't miss ONE pony

02:32.986 --> 02:35.754
and we really want
to go to the fair!

02:35.856 --> 02:38.724
Apparently, we're too
young to go alone..

02:39.326 --> 02:40.626
Well, duh.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.828
Young ponies like
you could get lost

02:42.930 --> 02:44.396
and never find
your way back,

02:44.498 --> 02:46.031
but I still can't go.

02:46.133 --> 02:49.334
Being a Wonderbolt isn't
<i>just</i> about showing off,

02:49.436 --> 02:51.170
it's also a
responsibility.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.871
You'll understand
when you get older.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.407
I'm sure you'll find
somepony else to take you.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.878
I wish I could, sugarcube.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.980
But Big Mac's not
feeling well today.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.182
Aww!

03:03.284 --> 03:05.917
But Big Mac's old enough
to take care of <i>himself</i>

03:06.019 --> 03:09.120
and we'd all have so
much fun together..

03:09.557 --> 03:11.390
Sometimes taking
care of somepony

03:11.492 --> 03:13.291
is more important
than having fun.

03:15.396 --> 03:18.263
Speaking of which, don't
you even THINK about

03:18.365 --> 03:21.166
trying to go without a grown
pony there to take care of YOU.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.236
You could end up in
hot water, or worse.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.872
We know...

03:26.874 --> 03:29.941
The fair could be over before
we find somepony to take us!

03:30.043 --> 03:31.710
But then we thought of YOU!

03:31.812 --> 03:33.979
Since the fair will
be full of all sorts

03:34.081 --> 03:35.982
of animals and creatures....!

03:36.784 --> 03:39.484
I'm sorry, but Twilight
has an important

03:39.586 --> 03:42.821
magical research project and
she's asked for my help.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.858
I guess that means
Twilight's busy too?

03:46.260 --> 03:49.361
I'm afraid I am. Starswirl
sent me this enchanted flower

03:49.463 --> 03:50.896
and it isn't doing well.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.964
If I figure out its
magical properties,

03:53.066 --> 03:54.299
maybe we can save it.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.236
So that's a "no" on going
with us to the fair?

03:57.338 --> 04:00.439
We've already asked
Applejack, Rainbow Dash,

04:00.541 --> 04:03.208
and Rarity and none
of them can come!

04:03.310 --> 04:05.143
And everypony
made it clear

04:05.245 --> 04:07.512
we're too young
to go on our own...

04:08.014 --> 04:09.147
Oh, definitely.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.850
You could take the wrong
train or miss your stop...

04:11.952 --> 04:13.985
Or get lost in a
strange town and end up

04:14.087 --> 04:17.088
in a dangerous situation
with nopony to help you!

04:17.390 --> 04:18.590
We know!

04:18.992 --> 04:20.692
I know it's hard,
but sometimes

04:20.794 --> 04:22.294
you just can't do
what you want.

04:22.396 --> 04:25.931
I'm pretty sure if YOU wanted
to go to the fair you could...

04:26.033 --> 04:28.500
Sure, grownups can do a lot
of things that foals can't,

04:28.802 --> 04:30.569
but there's plenty
we can't do either.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.871
Like right now, I can't
find a SINGLE reference

04:32.973 --> 04:34.140
to this flower!

04:34.742 --> 04:36.675
None of the birds or
insects I've talked to

04:36.777 --> 04:38.277
have heard of it either.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.178
I wonder if there's anything
in Shadetail Evergreen's

04:40.280 --> 04:41.847
Tome of Flora and Fauna?

04:41.949 --> 04:43.749
That book's <i>pretty</i>
out of date,

04:43.851 --> 04:45.750
but it might be
worth a try.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.519
I think there's a copy in
the library filed under

04:47.621 --> 04:49.054
"Discontinued But Still
Potentially Useful

04:49.156 --> 04:50.289
Ancient Texts."

04:50.691 --> 04:52.424
Unless I put it under
"Hokum With A Slight Chance

04:52.526 --> 04:53.692
of Practical Applications."

04:55.296 --> 04:58.196
I guess this flower is
the most interesting thing

04:58.298 --> 04:59.531
we're gonna see today..

04:59.633 --> 05:02.500
Unless you count watching
Twilight struggle to remember

05:02.602 --> 05:04.569
how she organizes her books.

05:04.671 --> 05:09.007
I bet every pony in Equestria
is in Appleoosa right now!

05:09.109 --> 05:11.209
Every pony but US.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.813
I wish we didn't have
to wait to grow up.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.949
I wish it would
happen all at once.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.785
Then we'd know everything
we'd need to get to the fair

05:20.887 --> 05:22.788
and back with no problem.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.425
I just wish we were
as old as our sisters!

05:26.627 --> 05:28.760
Then nopony could
tell us what to do,

05:28.862 --> 05:30.895
and we'd be able to
take care of ourselves!

The train to Appleoosa
isn't for a few hours..

Why not? It's just up the
road and Bloofy's MY pet too.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.509
Since when? Bloofy's
never even seen a CROWD,

12:57.611 --> 13:00.179
which you'd know if you
ever took care of him...

13:00.681 --> 13:02.447
Did you ever think
meeting all those ponies

13:02.549 --> 13:03.882
might be good for him?

13:07.554 --> 13:09.421
He seems OK meeting us.

See? They're grownups

to the fair with me, right?

think that, do ya?

If they go to the

And Spur probably
<i>should</i> share Bloofy.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.411
I mean, that's something a
grownup would say, right?

13:34.815 --> 13:38.683
As grownup ponies, we think
you should SHARE Bloofy

13:38.885 --> 13:41.020
and let Biscuit take
him to the fair.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.188
That is some quality
grownup advice!
