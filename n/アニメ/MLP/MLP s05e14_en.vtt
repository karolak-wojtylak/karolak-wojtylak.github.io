WEBVTT

00:21.880 --> 00:23.120
Was that the Pony Post?

00:24.780 --> 00:27.120
Oh, it was just you, Opal.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.730
Every other day he's
here like clockwork.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.880
But not today! What could
possibly be holding him up?

00:36.620 --> 00:39.480
Strawberry Cinnamon
Cilantro Salutations!

00:40.060 --> 00:40.380
What?

00:40.560 --> 00:41.480
What indeed!

00:41.480 --> 00:43.460
I bet you're wondering what
warrants such a welcome.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.340
Well, that welcome is warranted
by a pony that whisked up

00:46.340 --> 00:49.140
a warm batch of Strawberry
Cinnamon Cilantro cupcakes!

00:50.600 --> 00:52.800
That strangely sickening
flavor combination

00:52.800 --> 00:54.520
sounds just as bad as it tastes.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.120
Ugh.

00:56.580 --> 00:58.000
So I came here to
offer you some!

00:58.400 --> 01:01.573
After that visually descriptive
and disturbing endorsement,

01:01.733 --> 01:02.408
I'll pass.

01:02.986 --> 01:05.431
Oh! I almost forgot! I have
this letter for you, Rarity!

01:05.600 --> 01:07.146
The Post Pony was
going to deliver it,

01:07.324 --> 01:09.413
but after his Strawberry
Cinnamon Cilantro cupcake,

01:09.502 --> 01:11.466
he was feeling kind of queasy.

01:11.671 --> 01:13.301
And since I was
heading over anyway,

01:13.448 --> 01:15.370
I figured I could do it
for him. There you go!

01:15.507 --> 01:15.861
Oh!

01:23.794 --> 01:25.074
What's it say?

01:25.250 --> 01:26.148
I GOT IT!

01:26.308 --> 01:27.314
WOO HOO!

01:27.942 --> 01:28.468
Got what?

01:29.348 --> 01:31.051
I have been holding out
for the perfect location

01:31.051 --> 01:32.857
and it finally became available.

01:33.222 --> 01:38.377
So now I can fulfill my dream of
OPENING A BOUTIQUE IN CANTERLOT!

01:39.062 --> 01:41.874
I'M SO EXCITED, I THINK I'M
GOING TO LOSE MY CUPCAKES!

01:54.000 --> 02:04.311
Regular subtitles

We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

02:30.350 --> 02:32.711
Rarity's such a
savvy business pony!

02:32.711 --> 02:35.200
I'm so impressed she used
the huge bonus she earned

02:35.244 --> 02:38.266
making the costumes for Sapphire
Shores' Equestria-wide tour

02:38.266 --> 02:40.088
to open this
second boutique!

02:47.334 --> 02:50.502
I take it from your reaction
that you like the boutique.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.200
It's lovely.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.600
Gosh, Rarity, I know
hard work when I see it,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.911
and it looks like you worked
your hooves to the nub.

02:58.044 --> 03:01.822
I don't know. Those hooves don't
look nubby. They look scrubbied.

03:01.822 --> 03:03.480
And buffied. And pedied!

03:03.777 --> 03:07.777
Well, despite my nubby,
scrubby, buffy pony pedi,

03:08.044 --> 03:10.520
I actually have been
working very hard.

03:10.844 --> 03:12.755
However, I never could have
gotten the boutique ready

03:12.755 --> 03:13.822
for the Grand Opening

03:14.044 --> 03:17.688
without the help of my new
manager: Sassy Saddles!

03:22.666 --> 03:27.066
Bust my buttons, Rarity!
The Ponies from Ponyville!

03:29.244 --> 03:32.133
I knew I needed a manager
for Canterlot Carousel.

03:32.355 --> 03:34.400
So when Sassy showed
me her resume and I saw

03:34.510 --> 03:37.777
that she'd worked in all the
finest boutiques in Canterlot,

03:37.955 --> 03:39.911
I hired her right
on the spot!

03:40.133 --> 03:43.066
I then laid out this
plan or "pattern"

03:43.066 --> 03:46.577
as we say in the fashion
biz, for Canterlot Carousel,

03:46.577 --> 03:49.822
so that Rarity's boutique
will be a guaranteed success

03:49.822 --> 03:53.590
and those doors will
never, ever, ever close!

03:53.955 --> 03:57.600
Wow, Sassy, your attention to
detail is truly impressive.

03:57.777 --> 04:01.111
I've already put a pin in the
first piece of the pattern,

04:01.466 --> 04:03.466
"Beautify the Boutique."

04:03.866 --> 04:06.888
But next was the very
crucial pattern piece,

04:07.244 --> 04:09.410
"Marketing to the Mares."

04:09.688 --> 04:13.980
Turns out that everypony
here loves royalty!

04:14.311 --> 04:17.555
So I created a collection that
beautifully revolves around

04:17.555 --> 04:19.250
the royal element of Canterlot.

04:19.400 --> 04:23.620
And it just so happens there's a
hot new princess in Equestria.

04:23.955 --> 04:25.866
In every poll
Sassy Saddles took,

04:25.866 --> 04:27.660
you were the most
popular Princess!

04:27.977 --> 04:30.866
Coincidentally, one of my gowns
is inspired by the window

04:30.866 --> 04:33.730
in Canterlot Castle
commemorating your coronation!

04:39.822 --> 04:42.640
While I've always prided myself
on paying attention to detail.

04:43.022 --> 04:45.711
I've taken my latest collection
to a whole new level

04:45.711 --> 04:47.733
with Rarity's Rules of TLC.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.733
Judging by this baby, TLC stands
for Tasty Licorice Candy!

04:53.266 --> 04:56.222
TLC stands for Time,
Love, and Couture.

04:56.533 --> 04:58.644
And while I do agree that
this dress has potential,

04:58.933 --> 05:01.111
I have not had enough Time
to give it enough Love

05:01.111 --> 05:02.333
to become Couture.

05:03.733 --> 05:05.577
But the rest of the
gowns in tonight's line

05:05.577 --> 05:08.733
have met Rarity's Rules and
are ready to be presented!

05:08.733 --> 05:11.740
My marketing research also
confirmed that customers

05:11.740 --> 05:14.333
that viewed somepony
famous wearing a gown

05:14.533 --> 05:16.940
wished to own that
gown for themselves.

05:17.288 --> 05:21.550
I call this piece of the
pattern "Celebrity Status."

05:21.930 --> 05:24.288
So, Twilight, we were
wondering if perhaps

05:24.288 --> 05:26.288
you might possibly
wear this tonight?

05:28.355 --> 05:30.311
If being a Princess
and wearing that dress

05:30.311 --> 05:32.860
can help your boutique
in any way, then I say...

05:33.222 --> 05:35.133
Stick a pin in it! It's done!

05:35.644 --> 05:38.830
All right, everypony!
Let's set the stage!

05:39.244 --> 05:40.933
Ever since I was a little filly,

05:41.133 --> 05:44.200
all I've ever wanted was to own
a boutique here in Canterlot.

05:44.288 --> 05:47.377
Somepony pinch me, I'm
about to open the doors

05:47.377 --> 05:48.955
to that very boutique!

05:52.370 --> 05:57.377
Welcome to the Grand Opening
of Canterlot Carousel!

06:03.488 --> 06:05.711
Oh, hello! Nice to see you!

06:06.000 --> 06:08.755
Welcome, welcome! Oh, I'm
so happy you could make it!

06:08.755 --> 06:11.644
That Sassy totally stepped
on your hooves, Rarity!

06:11.911 --> 06:14.800
Oh, no! Did she mess
up that nice pony pedi?

06:15.666 --> 06:17.177
OK. Phew!

06:17.800 --> 06:20.155
Oh, I don't think she meant to.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.740
Rarity. Are you ready to
reveal the collection?

06:23.266 --> 06:26.022
Is she sure she doesn't
want to do it herself?

06:27.044 --> 06:27.680
Yeah.

06:28.133 --> 06:31.666
Yes, I am. Fluttershy. Could
you help Twilight get ready?

06:31.911 --> 06:33.044
Oh, certainly.

06:35.377 --> 06:37.111
Fillies and Gentlecolts!

06:37.400 --> 06:39.955
I am designer and
couturier, Rarity!

06:40.488 --> 06:42.377
I would like to
welcome you again

06:42.911 --> 06:45.177
to the Grand Opening
of Canterlot Carousel!

06:45.555 --> 06:47.244
And I am thrilled that
you're here to see

06:47.244 --> 06:50.533
my newest collection
inspired by this regal city.

07:05.977 --> 07:07.022
Rarity, I'm...

07:07.177 --> 07:09.777
Fashion Plate of
Cosmare Magazine!

07:10.066 --> 07:12.333
I'm so honored that Cosmare
was able to do a piece

07:12.333 --> 07:14.066
on the Grand Opening
of my boutique!

07:14.533 --> 07:17.000
Well, when Sassy Saddles
calls saying she's found

07:17.022 --> 07:18.511
the latest and
greatest in fashion,

07:18.511 --> 07:20.355
we high tail without fail!

07:20.355 --> 07:22.244
Now tell me all about
your latest collection.

07:22.533 --> 07:26.133
Ooh, uh. It's called
Rarity's Royal Regalia!

07:26.955 --> 07:28.000
Royally radiant!

07:28.822 --> 07:30.600
My favorite part
of being a designer

07:30.622 --> 07:31.977
is finding my inspiration.

07:32.288 --> 07:34.555
And that really wasn't difficult
when it came to Canterlot.

07:34.866 --> 07:37.733
Everywhere I looked, the
royal city just spoke to me!

07:37.911 --> 07:40.266
I call it, "In-Spire-ation!"

07:40.688 --> 07:42.377
Genius! Simply genius!

07:45.866 --> 07:48.377
I spent hours by the lily
pond on the castle grounds,

07:48.533 --> 07:51.088
which inspired this
gown, "Water Filly."

07:52.200 --> 07:53.466
Oh, the whimsy!

07:53.800 --> 07:56.000
Watching Celestia raise
the sun each morning

07:56.133 --> 07:57.688
literally lit up my day!

07:59.200 --> 08:01.288
This is "Tripping the Light!"

08:02.244 --> 08:03.444
Fantastic!

08:06.222 --> 08:10.066
And of course, Luna raising
the moon guided me to sleep.

08:10.377 --> 08:12.622
I call this, "Over the Moon."

08:13.022 --> 08:13.844
Oooh!

08:13.933 --> 08:15.644
Well, I certainly am!

08:16.333 --> 08:19.333
And for our finale, I have
something very special.

08:19.711 --> 08:22.555
I was inspired by the
stained glass window

08:22.555 --> 08:24.260
created in honor of
Princess Twilight.

08:24.911 --> 08:28.266
So I call this, "The
Reign in Stain!"

08:28.511 --> 08:30.844
Because the dress is
inspired by the...

08:30.844 --> 08:33.488
stained glass window
of a reigning Princess!

08:34.044 --> 08:34.570
Yes!

08:34.888 --> 08:38.066
Well, I think "The
Reign in Stain"

08:38.066 --> 08:39.866
is too difficult
to explain!

08:40.422 --> 08:43.266
Especially for the signature
piece of a collection!

08:43.600 --> 08:44.466
But I rather like...

08:44.466 --> 08:46.600
Fillies and Gentlecolts!

08:46.800 --> 08:49.688
I, Sassy Saddles, am
pleased to introduce

08:49.688 --> 08:52.333
the Grand Finale of
the Grand Opening

08:52.333 --> 08:56.822
of Rarity's Royal Regalia!
"The Princess Dress!"

09:01.777 --> 09:02.570
Success!

09:13.444 --> 09:15.555
Everypony! Please follow me

09:15.555 --> 09:20.177
and you can all place your
orders for...The Princess Dress!

09:22.444 --> 09:25.177
Rarity, I want to be the first
pony to congratulate you.

09:25.355 --> 09:27.088
The Princess Dress
has just guaranteed

09:27.088 --> 09:28.555
Canterlot Carousel's success!

09:35.088 --> 09:38.288
Yeah! Rarity's Royal
Regalia is amazing.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.970
And everypony seemed to
love the Princess Dress!

09:41.466 --> 09:43.622
You bet your saddle they did!

09:43.933 --> 09:48.150
Rarity now has one hundred
orders for her signature gown!

09:49.977 --> 09:53.350
One hundred
orders? All at one time?

09:53.733 --> 09:56.444
According to my pattern,
the next piece is

09:56.444 --> 09:58.577
"The Success of The
Signature Dress!"

09:58.777 --> 10:01.244
So, I do not see the problem!

10:02.755 --> 10:03.422
Uh...

10:04.577 --> 10:05.333
Cupcake?

10:08.977 --> 10:12.155
First of all, Sassy Saddles,
I would have appreciated

10:12.155 --> 10:16.310
getting to name the final gown
from my collection myself.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.711
My research shows that
your "Reign in Stain" name

10:21.711 --> 10:24.111
was a play on words that
was both very confusing

10:24.111 --> 10:25.822
and quite unappealing.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.133
While I see your point, we
should have discussed it

10:30.133 --> 10:32.266
prior to the Grand
Opening, Sassy.

10:32.577 --> 10:36.155
My only goal is for Canterlot
Carousel to succeed!

10:36.533 --> 10:38.511
That's why I changed the name.

10:38.777 --> 10:43.000
And that is why I took all those
orders for the Princess Dress.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.377
But receiving orders for one
hundred dresses in one day

10:47.600 --> 10:50.200
is just too much too soon.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.533
Are you actually saying we
should cancel these orders?

10:57.111 --> 11:01.977
No, Sassy. Promises were made
and I shall sew my very best

11:01.977 --> 11:05.488
to provide each and every pony
a Princess Dress full of TLC!

11:05.711 --> 11:08.244
Oh, thank you,
Rarity! Thank you!

11:16.755 --> 11:18.866
Oh, satin and silk, Rarity!

11:19.066 --> 11:21.822
Are you sure you don't want
your friends to help you

11:21.822 --> 11:22.977
make the dresses?

11:23.266 --> 11:26.110
No, Sassy. These orders
are my responsibility.

11:26.622 --> 11:28.666
All I have to do
is stick to my plan

11:28.666 --> 11:30.888
so I can deliver each
and every Princess Dress

11:31.244 --> 11:33.977

I'll take care of
her. You keep working.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.022
Uhh, actually, I'd love
to see her reaction

14:14.022 --> 14:15.577
to this particular dress.

14:15.888 --> 14:17.844
Paisley and Poplin, Rarity!

14:17.844 --> 14:19.844
Look at all the orders
you still have to finish!

14:20.000 --> 14:22.533
And you want to
take a break? Now?

14:22.844 --> 14:26.400
Well, it's just...I made
some really lovely changes

14:26.400 --> 14:27.155
to this dress.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.511
You did what?

14:28.866 --> 14:32.755
But every Princess Dress is
supposed to be exactly the same!

14:32.755 --> 14:35.800
Yes, yes, I know. But these
gems just spoke to me.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.577
Fine. Go see her reaction.

14:40.866 --> 14:43.480
Hello, and welcome to
Canterlot Carousel.

14:43.911 --> 14:46.711
I am so pleased to
present to you your...

14:47.133 --> 14:49.733
PRINCESS DRESS! Finally!

14:50.044 --> 14:51.755
I've been simply
desperate to get this

14:51.755 --> 14:54.120
ever since I saw Princess
Twilight wearing it at your...

14:54.711 --> 14:58.444
Wait a minute. There's
something different.

14:59.888 --> 15:02.600
Well, as an artiste,
I did take the liberty

15:02.600 --> 15:04.755
to change a few minor details.

15:06.711 --> 15:09.666
I...I saw these gems
glistening in the light

15:09.888 --> 15:11.200
and they just spoke to me.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.270
Aren't they lovely?
And so unique?

15:15.311 --> 15:19.822
They're fine. But they're not
what I ordered, are they?

15:20.733 --> 15:22.755
No...no, they're not.

15:23.133 --> 15:25.755
I want the dress to be
exactly like the one

15:25.755 --> 15:28.177
Princess Twilight
wore. Understand?

15:28.555 --> 15:30.533
Yes. Yes, of course.

16:20.133 --> 16:25.422
Raving ricrac, Rarity! You made
two hundred Princess Dresses!

16:26.177 --> 16:28.680
Yes. Isn't it spectacular?

16:29.044 --> 16:31.377
And I have a special
surprise for you!

16:31.644 --> 16:35.111
The latest issue of Cosmare
Magazine just hit the stands!

16:35.911 --> 16:38.022
Canterlot's
Newest Rising Star!

16:38.511 --> 16:40.800
And in the hour since
the magazine's come out,

16:41.066 --> 16:44.822
we've gotten another hundred new
orders for the Princess Dress!

16:46.355 --> 16:50.111
One...hundred...more...
Princess Dresses?

16:51.330 --> 16:53.400
I'm the Cosmare Coverpony.

16:53.888 --> 16:56.266
I have the most successful
shop in Canterlot.

16:56.844 --> 17:01.710
I've gotten everything I ever
wanted, but...I'm...miserable.

17:02.844 --> 17:04.533
How could you
possibly be miserable?

17:04.533 --> 17:08.733
My pattern is perfect.
"COSMARE COVERPONY!" Done!

17:08.733 --> 17:12.822
You have your signature gown!
"THE PRINCESS DRESS: A SUCCESS!"

17:13.066 --> 17:15.666
I don't want to make another
hundred Princess Dresses!

17:15.777 --> 17:17.155
I have a piece for that!

17:17.333 --> 17:20.888
"ASSEMBLE THE ASSEMBLY LINE!"
You'll never have to sew again

17:21.244 --> 17:22.570
What? No!

17:22.911 --> 17:26.644
Yes! Then the "CANTERLOT
CAROUSEL NEVER CLOSES!"

17:26.770 --> 17:29.977
and "SASSY SADDLES'
BOUTIQUE SUCCEEDS!"

17:29.977 --> 17:33.130
Stop! This is not
your boutique!

17:33.600 --> 17:36.200
And if this is what success
in Canterlot looks like,

17:36.200 --> 17:37.911
I want no part of it.

17:38.422 --> 17:41.800
Now, make up flyers for a
Going Out of Business Sale!

17:42.111 --> 17:44.260
I'm closing
Canterlot Carousel!

17:44.666 --> 17:47.444
What? No! Oh, you
can't, Rarity!

17:47.688 --> 17:49.777
I've worked too hard
to make this a success!

17:49.777 --> 17:52.844
I can't be a part of...
ANOTHER FAILED BOUTIQUE!

18:06.044 --> 18:09.422
Oh, don't you look lovely! Nice
to see you out here again.

18:13.822 --> 18:15.488
Seems Sassy Saddles
isn't rushing

18:15.488 --> 18:17.533
to open the door
this time. Hmm.

18:19.377 --> 18:21.511
Welcome to the Going
Out of Business Sale

18:21.511 --> 18:22.911
of Canterlot Carousel.

18:28.777 --> 18:31.022
Hey, is this Princess
Dress on sale?

18:31.400 --> 18:34.170
No, I'm sorry, the Princess
Dress has been discontinued.

18:34.511 --> 18:37.480
But there are plenty of other
lovely dresses on sale today.

18:37.911 --> 18:41.977
Whoa. This dress completely
speaks to my soul.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.355
Can I try it on?

18:43.600 --> 18:46.244
Certainly! The dressing
area is right back there.

18:46.711 --> 18:49.777
This is the most amazing
of amazing dresses!

18:50.155 --> 18:52.822
Just looking at it
brightens my day!

18:52.888 --> 18:55.355
And I'm sure you'll feel even
brighter once you try it on!

18:56.511 --> 18:58.822
Do you still have this
In-Spire-ation dress

18:58.822 --> 19:00.111
that's in the new
issue of Cosmare?

19:00.111 --> 19:02.840
Oh, yes, I do! It's right here!

19:03.177 --> 19:05.555
Bats in the belfry!
I have to try it on!

19:06.755 --> 19:11.888
Whoa, this dress makes
me feel like a Princess.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.355
And this dress makes me
feel like a Princess!

19:17.911 --> 19:19.688
This gown is quite beautiful,

19:19.888 --> 19:22.560
but it totally clashes
with my complexion.

19:22.977 --> 19:27.390
Hmm. Perhaps you'd be even
more taken with this one.

19:27.422 --> 19:30.530
It was inspired by the fountain
in the Canterlot Castle Garden.

19:30.888 --> 19:33.066
I call it, "The
Fountain of Truth."

19:33.577 --> 19:35.755
It's exactly what
I've been dreaming of!

19:36.044 --> 19:39.444
Ooh! Well, then, I'll finish it
and the gown shall be yours!

19:41.044 --> 19:42.610
How could I have forgotten?

19:43.066 --> 19:45.510
This is what I've
been dreaming about!

19:47.622 --> 19:51.888
<i> ♪ My favorite moment's</i>
<i> when a pony sees it ♪</i>

19:51.955 --> 19:56.577

19:56.844 --> 20:01.377

20:11.000 --> 20:16.200
Attention everypony! Canterlot
Carousel WILL NOT be closing!

20:18.577 --> 20:22.044
But this stuff's
still on sale, right?

20:22.955 --> 20:24.680
Yes, yes, of course.

20:25.066 --> 20:27.688
Oh, Rarity,
I'm so sorry!

20:28.022 --> 20:29.888
I focused on that
one dress

20:30.133 --> 20:33.360
and the rest of Rarity's
Royal Regalia paid the price.

20:33.755 --> 20:35.660
Well, so did the
Princess Dress.

20:36.088 --> 20:38.422
The more I sewed, the
more each dress lost its

20:38.422 --> 20:43.870
Time, Love, and Couture becoming
Terrible, Lackluster and Common.

20:44.177 --> 20:47.570
I think I finally understand
the Rules of Rarity

20:47.955 --> 20:50.733
and will apply them
at my next job.

20:51.044 --> 20:51.910
I beg your pardon?

20:52.133 --> 20:54.066
The Rules of Rarity
are only to be applied

20:54.066 --> 20:55.510
at Canterlot Carousel.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.888
Which is why you must continue
to manage the boutique

20:58.888 --> 20:59.950
while I'm in Ponyville.

21:00.466 --> 21:01.222
Ponyville?

21:01.622 --> 21:04.177
Well, yes, I'll come to
Canterlot with new designs

21:04.177 --> 21:05.420
and to see the
customers, of course,

21:05.822 --> 21:08.400
but Ponyville was always
going to be my home base.

21:09.111 --> 21:10.955
Bobbins and
bodkins, Rarity!

21:11.066 --> 21:12.622
Oh, thank you,
thank you!

21:12.777 --> 21:16.570
And I promise to run everything
following your rules!

21:16.977 --> 21:18.800
I would expect
nothing less!

21:20.066 --> 21:24.111
OH MY GOSH! A SALE?! DO YOU
HAVE THAT PRINCESS DRESS?

21:24.488 --> 21:25.133
NO!
