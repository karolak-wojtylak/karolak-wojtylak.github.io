WEBVTT

00:03.740 --> 00:06.250
Come on! If we hurry,
we can get there

00:06.290 --> 00:08.740
before the paper's even
delivered to Rarity's house.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.390
Maybe she won't
read the article.

00:11.550 --> 00:13.750
I'm pretty sure Rarity
is going to read a review

00:13.790 --> 00:15.450
of her new boutique
in Manehattan.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.810
I still can't believe we
all just blabbed everything

00:17.860 --> 00:19.450
that happened to
that reporter.

00:19.870 --> 00:22.080
I just hope it doesn't end
up being an article about

00:22.120 --> 00:24.860
how her friends almost
ruined the opening.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.520
I think you're all
over-reacting.

00:27.780 --> 00:28.930
Rarity is our friend.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.480
If any pony is going to
understand, it'll be her.

00:32.710 --> 00:35.850
I was wondering when all of
you were going to show up.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.460
Now we can all read
the review together!

00:42.720 --> 00:46.140
Um, I have an idea. How
'bout we don't read it?

00:46.830 --> 00:49.150
What she means is,
before you read it,

00:49.190 --> 00:50.860
we should probably
tell you about--

00:50.910 --> 00:53.730
No, no, darlings.
Please, no spoilers.

00:54.460 --> 00:54.700
But--

00:54.880 --> 00:55.990
NO SPOILERS!

01:05.366 --> 01:10.360
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu/

01:40.580 --> 01:43.480
Now, is everypony ready
to hear what I'm sure

01:43.520 --> 01:46.640
is a stellar review that
describes in stunning detail

01:46.680 --> 01:48.620
exactly how each
of you contributed

01:48.650 --> 01:51.040
to the successful opening
of Rarity for You?

01:56.340 --> 01:59.560
"Many a pony has tried their
hoof at joining the ranks

01:59.620 --> 02:00.910
of the elite fashion
trend-setters

02:00.960 --> 02:02.260
currently ensconced
in the boutiques

02:02.320 --> 02:04.280
of Manhattan's
famed Saddle Row.

02:04.450 --> 02:07.580
Some might say it's the
ultimate achievement

02:07.630 --> 02:10.930
in Equestrian fashion and
never before has a reporter

02:10.990 --> 02:14.370
been granted such unfettered
behind-the-scenes access,

02:14.410 --> 02:15.480
until now.

02:16.340 --> 02:18.130
I wish it had been
more fettered.

02:18.370 --> 02:21.040
Ah!

02:21.220 --> 02:24.850
"I sat down with
Rarity and her friends

02:24.930 --> 02:27.170
after the opening to
get the inside scoop.

02:27.430 --> 02:29.750
And what a scoop it was..."

02:34.600 --> 02:37.610
OK, kid. You successfully
opened a shop in Manehattan

02:37.670 --> 02:39.400
and that's no mean feat.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.360
Most ponies might wonder
what it feels like.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.610
Here's how it's gonna be.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.450
I'm going to interview
you and your friends

02:44.510 --> 02:46.410
so I can paint a picture of
how it all came together,

02:46.540 --> 02:48.890
a word picture mind you,
not an actual picture.

02:48.990 --> 02:49.920
Any questions?

02:50.260 --> 02:51.300
Well, I was wondering--

02:51.330 --> 02:52.240
Let's get started!

02:52.620 --> 02:55.680
Ms. Rarity. You got
shops all over Equestria,

02:55.820 --> 02:57.760
but this was your first
time trying to make it

02:57.810 --> 02:58.830
in the big city.

02:58.990 --> 03:01.400
What made you think you
could tackle it on your own?

03:01.770 --> 03:04.000
Well, I wouldn't say
all over Equestria.

03:04.180 --> 03:06.020
I just have two
other boutiques,

03:06.120 --> 03:07.810
one in my home
town of Ponyville

03:07.900 --> 03:09.340
and one in
Canterlot.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.580
Uh, still, when I
decided to open this one,

03:12.710 --> 03:14.930
I was nothing
but confident.

03:16.180 --> 03:18.270
Let's just say that
if I could choose,

03:18.300 --> 03:21.240
I probably wouldn't do it
that way again.

03:21.750 --> 03:25.400
Well, it wasn't the
funnest party ever.

03:25.740 --> 03:28.090
It was a plum-puckered,
pig-pushin' disaster!

03:28.520 --> 03:31.220
After a lifetime of
awesome, I think everypony's

03:31.260 --> 03:33.270
allowed to mess up every
now and then, right?

03:34.340 --> 03:36.110
Wait, are you
writing this down?

03:36.470 --> 03:39.920
Um. It didn't go exactly
how I thought it would,

03:40.050 --> 03:42.560
but it um, started
out all right.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.370
Welcome to Saddle Row.

03:48.510 --> 03:51.210
An entire street lined with
the most fashionable boutiques

03:51.260 --> 03:52.700
in all of Equestria.

03:52.780 --> 03:54.650
If it's supposed to be
the most fashionable

03:54.730 --> 03:55.610
block of shops,

03:55.720 --> 03:58.230
where's Stinky Bottom's
Discount Hat Emporium?

03:58.430 --> 04:00.620
I suppose it didn't
make the cut.

04:00.930 --> 04:04.360
Here it is!
Rarity For You.

04:11.040 --> 04:14.010
Rarity, it's lovely, but
are you sure you'll be ready

04:14.050 --> 04:15.050
to open tonight?

04:15.800 --> 04:18.750
Ah-CHOO!

04:20.060 --> 04:21.930
No need to fret over
a mere moderate amount

04:22.010 --> 04:24.550
of preparation. My
clothes arrive soon;

04:24.720 --> 04:28.180
my sales associate after that
and with a little dusting,

04:28.420 --> 04:30.520
we'll be ready for the
Grand Opening tonight.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.640
Rarity! So good to see you.

04:33.760 --> 04:38.080
Your store, it's going to be
a very good place, I think.

04:39.490 --> 04:43.910
Mr. Stripes owns the building.
He's a very pleasant landlord.

04:44.590 --> 04:47.320
A-a-although he can
be pushy at times.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.800
OK, all the time.

04:50.740 --> 04:53.810
You've met my daughter?
The apple of my ear,

04:53.960 --> 04:57.650
the hay in my hoof. You
will let her work with you!

04:58.430 --> 05:01.740
It's just... I'm
dreadfully busy preparing

05:01.820 --> 05:04.870
for tonight's grand
opening, as you can see.

05:05.190 --> 05:08.460
There are only two things I
love more than being pushy.

05:08.670 --> 05:12.400
One is my daughter. The other
is miniature doll furniture.

05:12.630 --> 05:16.240
And I would sell my entire
mini-furniture collection

05:16.370 --> 05:19.980
to make my daughter
happy. You understand?

05:21.940 --> 05:24.880
I'm sorry, I just don't think
it's going to be possible.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.630
Let me say another way:

05:27.900 --> 05:30.980
hire her or I raise rent
until you no can afford.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.880
Oh, uh, welcome aboard!

05:35.510 --> 05:37.490
First idea! Instead of clothes,

05:37.660 --> 05:39.490
we sell glow-in-the-dark teeth.

05:39.730 --> 05:43.580
Like this. but they'd
glow in the dark!

05:44.510 --> 05:48.490
Golly, what a splendid idea!

05:48.770 --> 05:51.690
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK TEETH!
What was she thinking?

05:56.010 --> 05:58.020
Fluttershy!

05:58.110 --> 06:01.320
Your assistance is required
in the stock room post-haste.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.170
Awwwww, hello.

06:06.270 --> 06:08.090
But what are they doing here?

06:10.390 --> 06:12.630
Smokey made too much
noise eating garbage,

06:12.680 --> 06:16.730
so Softpad's mother made them
move out of the trash can.

06:17.020 --> 06:19.600
Then Smokey Junior found a
nice home in the crawl space

06:19.650 --> 06:22.160
behind the building, but
Mr. Stripes demolished it

06:22.210 --> 06:24.060
so they were temporarily
camped out in the back

06:24.100 --> 06:25.790
until they found a
new place to live.

06:26.890 --> 06:29.300
No no no, I can't have a
family of rubbish-scented

06:29.360 --> 06:31.560
raccoons living in my boutique.

06:33.420 --> 06:35.840
Uh, did you hear that?

06:36.650 --> 06:40.240
Turns out there's a Club
Pony Party Palace upstairs.

06:40.460 --> 06:44.220
Turns out there's a Club
Pony Party Palace upstairs!

07:00.960 --> 07:04.770
I'm sorry. Could you please
ask her to turn it down?

07:06.700 --> 07:09.790
COULD YOU ASK HER TO
TURN IT DOWN PLEASE?

07:11.640 --> 07:17.290
TURN IT DOWN PLEASE?
OH PLEASE!

07:19.770 --> 07:22.890
Ugh. Foals today listen
to their so-called "music"

07:22.980 --> 07:24.070
far too loud.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.840
I realize that makes me
sound like an old mare.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.520
But this is business!

07:34.760 --> 07:37.670
I wish we were having
as much fun as they are.

07:37.770 --> 07:39.910
Well, sweeping can
be fun too.

07:40.410 --> 07:45.620
Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.
Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.

07:46.590 --> 07:49.990
Only Twilight could make a
dance remix about sweeping.

07:50.110 --> 07:51.740
I mean, how lame
is that?

07:51.910 --> 07:53.840
Yeah, it wasn't
even catchy.

07:53.960 --> 07:54.780
Nope.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.060
Sweep! Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!

07:58.090 --> 08:03.100
Sweep! Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!
Sweep! Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!

08:03.510 --> 08:06.810
Apparently, DJ Pon-3
has a residency

08:06.860 --> 08:08.500
at the party
palace upstairs,

08:08.580 --> 08:10.240
but security won't
let me speak to her!

08:10.830 --> 08:13.660
Bahh! What in the name
of Celestia was that!

08:14.200 --> 08:17.510
You know how most stores
have a little jingle bell

08:17.570 --> 08:22.190
when the door opens? I thought
we should have something

08:22.240 --> 08:23.680
with a little more "pizazz."

08:23.930 --> 08:26.650
So I installed one of
Daddy's antique horns.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.940
Ugh! We'll have to do
something about that.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.170
After I think of a way
to quiet down that music.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.590
And after I finish designing
the window display.

08:38.820 --> 08:39.870
Ahhh!

08:44.260 --> 08:47.780
Wait. is this my merchandise
shipment from Ponyville?

08:48.070 --> 08:50.020
It's completely
disorganized.

08:50.890 --> 08:52.500
Ah! Uh.

08:53.650 --> 08:55.830
Ah...ugh...ah...

08:55.980 --> 09:00.440
Gesundheit! Oh! Miss Pommel!
I'm so glad to see you.

09:00.690 --> 09:03.300
Now, as the sole sales
associate at Rarity for You,

09:03.560 --> 09:05.950
I hate to add to your
already overflowing plate

09:05.990 --> 09:09.100
of responsibilities, but
it looks as though we have

09:09.160 --> 09:12.040
just a tad more to do before
tonight than I thought.

09:12.520 --> 09:17.630
Actually, I...Ugh ah!
I can't work tonight.

09:18.010 --> 09:19.160
Oh? Why not?

09:25.460 --> 09:29.050
Feel better, my sweet. We'll
manage without you, somehow.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.060
And we'll manage glowing
teeth and car horns

09:32.130 --> 09:34.520
and disorganized
clothes and dance music.

09:34.630 --> 09:35.890
Am I forgetting anything?

09:39.610 --> 09:43.040
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

09:46.670 --> 09:48.970
Well, opening a
store in Manehattan

09:49.010 --> 09:50.690
is a pretty big deal.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.400
It's natural that Rarity
would be a little stressed

09:54.460 --> 09:57.130
about how it was going...
since it wasn't going well.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.710
Still, I think she
handled it all right.

10:00.160 --> 10:05.130
The dream is doomed!
Doomed, I tell you! Doomed!

10:06.070 --> 10:08.270
I know things haven't
gone perfectly so far,

10:08.610 --> 10:10.420
but we've done this
kind of thing before.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.110
If we all work
together...

10:12.160 --> 10:15.310
I appreciate the offer,
but this is Manehattan.

10:15.540 --> 10:16.910
To make it in the
fashion scene here,

10:16.930 --> 10:19.610
everything has to be perfect.
The perfect location.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.810
The perfect clothes.
The perfect opening.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.790
Maybe we should
just postpone.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.120
Postpone? Darling,
tonight is the last night

10:28.160 --> 10:29.370
of the fall season.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.130
If we don't open
tonight it won't be...

10:32.230 --> 10:33.850
Perfect.

10:34.190 --> 10:37.970
Yes. I know what needs to be
done. I just need more of me.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.380
Oh, how I wish I could
make copies of myself!

10:40.800 --> 10:43.920
Yeah. Making copies of
yourself always sounds

10:43.980 --> 10:45.750
like a great idea, but
before you know it,

10:45.800 --> 10:47.450
you're locked in a room
with fifty Pinkie Pies

10:47.500 --> 10:48.560
watching paint dry.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.350
We can do this and we can
stay true to your vision.

10:54.830 --> 10:59.020
You'd do that? Fluttershy,
you'll handle those

10:59.280 --> 11:01.250
strong-smelling
raccoons for me?

11:01.530 --> 11:03.010
Of course!

11:03.090 --> 11:06.440
Leave Plaid Stripes to me.
I'll handle her and her...uh

11:06.520 --> 11:07.760
..."good" ideas.

11:07.850 --> 11:10.790
Oh! Oh! Oh! And I can go
upstairs to that nonstop party

11:10.840 --> 11:12.280
and have tons of fun
and eat some cake

11:12.360 --> 11:13.460
and set up party
cannons and--

11:15.240 --> 11:17.310
...and then make
them be quiet.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.950
I'm pretty sure I know
somepony who wouldn't mind

11:21.020 --> 11:23.330
organizing this merchandise
shipment for you.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.520
I'm talking about myself.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.980
Oh PLEASE let
me organize it!

11:32.470 --> 11:35.550
This all sounds splendid, but
I don't even have a single

11:35.610 --> 11:38.310
employee and I'll need
the best of the best.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.520
Leave the hiring to me.

11:40.790 --> 11:43.090
Oh! This is it,
my dears!

11:43.250 --> 11:44.620
If you can handle
these problems,

11:44.700 --> 11:47.230
I'll focus on the designs for
the front window display.

11:47.450 --> 11:51.530
We'll show Manehattan what
Rarity for You is all about.

11:51.980 --> 11:54.720
Aww! What would
I do without you?

11:55.170 --> 11:58.190
What would she do without
us? Huh, let me think.

11:58.550 --> 12:04.050
"Darlings, I'm absolutely
doomed! Doomed! DOOMED!"

12:04.180 --> 12:05.990
Ha, I sounded
just like her.

12:06.390 --> 12:08.700
Hey, you're not writing
this down, are you?

12:10.280 --> 12:14.390
Now for the perfect
window display. Hmmm.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.850
Ooo! I can't really
stop a super-fun party

12:25.900 --> 12:27.780
in the middle of
mega-happy-fun times,

12:27.860 --> 12:29.270
can I?

12:29.370 --> 12:31.490
What would Rarity want?

12:31.590 --> 12:34.530
Keep that party going
till the break of dawn!

12:34.810 --> 12:35.770
Really?

12:35.920 --> 12:39.690
Indubitably! And as for
the roof? Get jiggy!

12:39.740 --> 12:40.960
Raise it, Pinkie!

12:41.120 --> 12:43.900
Raise it like you've
never raised it before!

12:44.010 --> 12:45.850
Hah! If you say so!

12:46.560 --> 12:48.200
Oh please, Pinkie Pie!

12:48.250 --> 12:50.870
Never in a million years
would I say such balderdash!

12:57.950 --> 13:01.910
Obviously DJ Pon-3 only
plays the sickest of beats.

13:02.220 --> 13:04.430
I just wouldn't want her
to miss out on the coolest

13:04.510 --> 13:07.070
new music straight from
the back alley underground

13:07.150 --> 13:08.920
zip-zop party scene!

13:10.750 --> 13:12.620
I'd play the whole
thing if I were you,

13:12.750 --> 13:14.480
no matter what
other ponies think!

13:22.160 --> 13:23.830
Awwwwww.

13:24.610 --> 13:27.660
Rarity for You is only
hiring the best of the best

13:27.780 --> 13:30.220
and to me that
means the fastest.

13:31.390 --> 13:34.970
Now...uh, before
we begin...

13:35.160 --> 13:38.120
Am I doing this right?
What would Rarity want?

13:39.660 --> 13:41.200
New plan.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.710
Who can be the first one to
tell me what fabric this is?

13:45.480 --> 13:47.300
That's organza.

13:47.570 --> 13:49.190
Are you sure?

13:49.490 --> 13:52.240
It's a thin, plain
weave, sheer fabric,

13:52.290 --> 13:55.240
traditionally made
from silk, so...yeah.

13:56.260 --> 13:58.400
I don't know the first
thing about clothes.

13:58.590 --> 14:00.610
Pretty much all I can
do is look at something

14:00.680 --> 14:02.110
and tell you if
it's clothes or not.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.960
This chair?
Not clothes.

14:06.190 --> 14:07.790
See if you can keep
up with me here.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.900
What are all
clothes made of?

14:11.370 --> 14:12.540
Uh, fabric?

14:12.710 --> 14:17.130
Bingo! But not in this
store. Uh uh. Not anymore.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.090
Oh no?

14:18.380 --> 14:21.700
Two words for you:
spoon clothes.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.870
All our clothes will
be made of spoons!

14:25.320 --> 14:27.540
What would Rarity want?

14:28.900 --> 14:30.820
You know, I like
you, Plaid Stripes.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.540
If it were up to me, we'd
have a spoon clothes store

14:33.600 --> 14:36.160
right next to Stinky Bottom's
Discount Hat Emporium.

14:36.660 --> 14:40.410
But it ain't up to me.
So...the answer is no.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.260
Personally? I think spoon
clothes ain't such a bad idea.

14:46.460 --> 14:49.150
Useful, too. Eatin'
soup. Stirrin' gumbo.

14:49.270 --> 14:50.360
Diggin' little holes.

14:51.660 --> 14:53.800
There. Perfect.

14:54.810 --> 14:57.280
Although, what
would Rarity want?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.690
Maybe she wouldn't
like it done by color.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.650
Guess I have to
start over!

15:03.410 --> 15:07.250
Hello Smokey. Softpad.
Smokey Junior.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.880
I have some,
interesting news. I...

15:11.100 --> 15:14.220
Oh, I'd like you to all stay
here forever, but...

15:14.880 --> 15:16.360
What would Rarity want?

15:18.460 --> 15:20.830
You have to move out!

15:23.910 --> 15:26.530
A window display is the
first thing customers see.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.730
And if they like it,
they'll walk inside

15:28.780 --> 15:31.340
and experience the glory
that is my boutique.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.180
I don't know which
one of you to hire!

15:34.410 --> 15:35.890
Just keep guessing fabrics.

15:36.010 --> 15:38.720
Daddy! Rarity's friend
doesn't like my ideas!

15:38.870 --> 15:41.190
Spoon clothes! Is good idea!

15:42.530 --> 15:45.340
Oh no! Not a shopping
music mash-up!

15:45.730 --> 15:47.760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

16:02.950 --> 16:04.700
When you write the story,

16:04.750 --> 16:06.400
could you maybe
skip over the part

16:06.470 --> 16:10.010
where we locked Rarity in the
window display?

16:13.960 --> 16:17.600
Hello? The door
appears to be stuck.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.060
Yep! We're working on it!

16:20.600 --> 16:23.680
Hm. Well, shouldn't let
this time go to waste.

16:27.450 --> 16:28.580
How did this happen?

16:28.750 --> 16:30.160
I shut down the party.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.260
I told Plaid Stripes no.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.460
I asked the raccoons to leave.

16:34.990 --> 16:37.230
I asked a lot of
fabric questions.

16:37.450 --> 16:40.020
...just like I thought
Rarity would want.

16:40.860 --> 16:42.990
Rarity asked us to help
her with everything

16:43.030 --> 16:44.930
because she knows
all of us so well.

16:45.210 --> 16:47.130
She knows how much
you care for animals.

16:47.370 --> 16:49.610
She'd trust you to solve
the problem your way.

16:49.740 --> 16:51.180
Maybe we should all
do the same.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.990
Doing this our way
is what Rarity wants.

16:54.130 --> 16:57.440
It's not too late. Let's all
dig in and we can fix this...

16:59.770 --> 17:02.190
...before Rarity finds
out how bad we messed up.

17:05.730 --> 17:07.550
I'm sorry I asked
you to leave.

17:07.790 --> 17:10.760
The place is yours,
if you want to stay.

17:12.890 --> 17:16.660
Though I would like to ask
you all just one favor.

17:20.380 --> 17:23.890
I'm sorry I made you play
that unfun superboring music.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.740
But if you're up for it,

17:26.820 --> 17:29.750
I have an idea to make
the party even better.

17:32.370 --> 17:36.850
OK, I don't get fabric,
but I do get speed.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.920
And I need somepony
fast enough

17:38.970 --> 17:42.620
to help all the costumers
Rarity is going to have so...

17:43.520 --> 17:45.740
First one to the river
and back gets the job!

17:48.260 --> 17:50.620
IT'S A RACE! GO!

17:58.250 --> 18:01.060
Mr. Stripes, I owe your
daughter an apology.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.860
She's got good ideas and I
should give 'em a chance.

18:04.290 --> 18:06.020
So here's what
I'm thinking.

18:13.430 --> 18:14.320
Perfect!

18:21.100 --> 18:24.240
Wow, looks like we fixed
that door just in time!

18:25.590 --> 18:29.120
Ooh. What's all this?

18:33.370 --> 18:35.560
The whole place
organized by style,

18:35.700 --> 18:39.130
cross-referenced by size and
reverse-indexed by fabric.

18:39.290 --> 18:40.680
She'll be able to
find anything

18:40.730 --> 18:42.510
in three seconds flat.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.070
It was some of my
best work.

18:46.350 --> 18:49.330
Oh, I knew I could
count on you!

18:50.410 --> 18:53.380
All right. I suppose this
is the moment of truth.

18:59.790 --> 19:02.660
Rarity for You
is now open!

19:11.550 --> 19:13.900
Oh, dear, I wasn't quite
prepared for such a crowd.

19:14.140 --> 19:15.440
How will I handle
them all?

19:15.620 --> 19:16.850
My name is Blue Bobbin.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.070
I'll be your personal shopping
assistant this evening.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.840
Right this way,
everypony

19:21.940 --> 19:25.370
and one of our talented sales
ponies can help you out.

19:26.190 --> 19:28.050
Honestly, they were
all pretty slow,

19:28.200 --> 19:29.460
but they finished the race.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.820
Plus they knew a lot more
about fabric than I did,

19:32.130 --> 19:34.130
so I hired them all.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.510
The way I see it,
Rarity designs fashion.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.290
DJ Pon-3 designs beats.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.310
What better combination
than a boutique dance club?

20:08.730 --> 20:11.560
After a quick bath, they were
more than willing to help.

20:13.560 --> 20:18.050
Ah, a blue corn reduction
with shallot confit, but...

20:18.160 --> 20:19.870
how can I possibly
enjoy it without a...

20:19.910 --> 20:20.830
--Spoon?

20:23.320 --> 20:26.440
Told ya spoon-clothes
ain't such a bad idea.

20:28.520 --> 20:32.820
Ah! Mmm...mm!
Exquisite.

20:33.090 --> 20:35.310
This is the most whimsical

20:35.350 --> 20:39.660
and wonderfully fashionable
boutique I've ever seen.

20:44.060 --> 20:46.570
"In the end, Rarity's
Grand Opening

20:46.630 --> 20:48.380
was a smashing success.

20:48.670 --> 20:50.800
True, it got off to
a rocky start..."

20:50.890 --> 20:54.310
"...But somehow this ragtag
group of ne'er-do-wells"

20:54.530 --> 20:56.260
Oo! Heavens, I
think he means you!

20:56.550 --> 20:59.420
"came together and created
the perfect boutique,

20:59.720 --> 21:03.080
a vision of Rarity,
combined with the expertise

21:03.120 --> 21:04.820
of her friends.

21:05.110 --> 21:08.370
This reporter, for
one, is a believer."

21:09.340 --> 21:11.870
Why didn't you tell me there
were so many problems!

21:12.040 --> 21:14.240
We all figured you had
enough on your mind.

21:14.390 --> 21:16.380
And we didn't want you
to think that the opening

21:16.450 --> 21:20.560
wasn't perfect.
ne'er-do-wells or not,

21:20.800 --> 21:23.120
I know I can always
count on all of you.

21:23.350 --> 21:26.430
And nothing could be more
perfect than that.
