00:13.580 --> 00:16.080
Happy Hearth's Warming Eve!

00:18.220 --> 00:21.340
Shucks, Twilight, y'all done
it up nice and cozy in here.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.100
We're about to hang our
Hearth's Warming Dolls,

00:24.100 --> 00:25.180
if you want to join us.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.150
Well, that's mighty
sweet of you,

00:27.480 --> 00:28.860
but we're just stopping
in to wish y'all

00:28.860 --> 00:30.560
a happy Hearth's
Warming before we go.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.260
I think it's sweet
that your families

00:33.260 --> 00:34.730
are spending the
holiday together.

00:35.060 --> 00:37.560
Picture the most funtacular
thing you can think of.

00:37.960 --> 00:41.500
Now multiply that times
infinity! IT'S GONNA BE GREAT!

00:43.160 --> 00:44.760
That's us! See you later!

00:45.600 --> 00:46.880
Now can we open presents?

00:47.820 --> 00:49.680
But tonight is
Hearth's Warming Eve.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.660
Everypony knows you don't
open presents till tomorrow.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.150
When Spike and I spent our first
Hearth's Warming Eve together,

00:56.460 --> 00:58.490
he couldn't wait all night
to open his presents.

00:58.820 --> 01:01.600
Ever since then, we've always
opened them the night before.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.460
It's kinda like...
our tradition.

01:04.140 --> 01:05.800
That's not how our
family does it.

01:06.140 --> 01:09.160
And I reckon it can't be how
Pinkie's does it, is it?

01:09.560 --> 01:10.860
No, sir-eee!

01:11.520 --> 01:12.800
To each their own, I suppose.

01:14.820 --> 01:15.960
AH! GOTTA GO! BYE!

01:27.040 --> 01:29.480
Just what I always
wanted! A book!

01:37.760 --> 01:49.320
Hearing impaired subtitles
by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

02:12.780 --> 02:14.400
Chancellor Puddinghead Puddings?

02:14.620 --> 02:16.900
How about a
Windigo-frosted snow cone?

02:18.540 --> 02:21.860
It's so exciting. Related or
not, it's gonna be a hoot

02:21.860 --> 02:23.780
havin' our families
together under one roof.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.160
Apples and Pies, together again
for the first time, maybe,

02:27.300 --> 02:29.020
unless we're related,
which maybe we're not.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.720
I think I just
confused myself.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.520
Friends or family, this
here's about togetherness.

02:34.740 --> 02:37.120
Have you tried the
Equestria Flag Crepes?

02:37.320 --> 02:38.920
The blue is BLUEBERRY!

02:39.480 --> 02:42.860
And don't tell Granny I saw, but
her trunk is full of presents!

02:43.320 --> 02:45.220
Now hang
on, Sugarcube.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.900
You know Hearth's
Warming isn't just about

02:47.900 --> 02:49.560
candy and presents, right?

02:49.940 --> 02:53.900
Uh oh. That's your boring
sisterly lecture voice.

02:54.400 --> 02:59.760
'Fraid so. Ahem. A long
time ago, the Earth Ponies,

02:59.960 --> 03:03.460
<i> Pegasus Ponies,and Unicorn</i>
<i> Ponies weren't friends.</i>

03:03.780 --> 03:04.840
"I don't like you!"

03:05.140 --> 03:06.620
"I don't like
you either!"

03:07.060 --> 03:10.220
<i> But then the icy</i>
<i> chill of the Windigos</i>

03:10.500 --> 03:12.140
<i> almost iced up everything.</i>

03:12.680 --> 03:14.890
<i> So the ponies decided</i>
<i> to work together</i>

03:15.220 --> 03:17.960
<i> and their friendship drove</i>
<i> them nasty critters away.</i>

03:18.380 --> 03:19.760
"Beat it, Windigos!"

03:20.420 --> 03:23.540
<i> Triumphant, they raised</i>
<i> a new flag to celebrate</i>

03:23.540 --> 03:26.720
<i> all three tribes, and</i>
<i> Equestria was born.</i>

03:28.080 --> 03:29.640
Uh, what happened
to the flag...?

03:30.640 --> 03:31.880
I don't know.

03:34.140 --> 03:36.880
Is that why we celebrate
with a flag-raising tomorrow?

03:37.260 --> 03:40.200
Mm-hm. And tonight we'll
have the traditional

03:40.200 --> 03:41.400
Hearth's Warming Eve Dinner

03:41.700 --> 03:44.380
to remember the shared
bounties of our ancestors.

03:44.900 --> 03:45.990
We do that, too!

03:46.420 --> 03:48.700
Then we'll hang our
Hearth's Warming Dolls

03:48.700 --> 03:51.720
over the fireplace, to remind
us of the warmth shared

03:51.720 --> 03:52.990
on that fateful night.

03:53.420 --> 03:55.400
That's what our family does too!

03:56.000 --> 03:58.040
And tomorrow, we open presents.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.100
WE DO THAT TOO!

04:01.180 --> 04:02.720
It sounds like the
Apples and the Pies

04:02.720 --> 04:04.340
do everything the same way.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.200
Of course! We might be related!

04:07.560 --> 04:09.510
Hey, I was going to say that!

04:09.880 --> 04:11.910
Stop saying what I'm saying!

04:12.380 --> 04:13.560
You stop it first!

04:25.360 --> 04:28.300
I'm so happy I need to make up
a new word for how happy I am.

04:29.420 --> 04:31.420
What about, "Rooftastic!"?

04:32.360 --> 04:33.340
Rooftastic?

04:33.700 --> 04:37.040
As in: I gotta get on the
roof and yell to everypony

04:37.300 --> 04:39.200
HOW ROOFTASTIC THIS IS!

04:42.280 --> 04:44.360
What if our families
don't like each other?

04:45.060 --> 04:46.340
We are friends,
Applejack.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.900
And after tonight, our families
are going to be friends too!

04:49.300 --> 04:50.240
Do you know what
that means?

04:50.658 --> 04:52.658
Number of Apples times
number of Pies is 24

04:52.660 --> 04:54.720
minus my pre-existing
friendships plus 1 for Maud

04:54.720 --> 04:56.220
and you makes 5 from 24 is--

04:57.340 --> 04:59.880
Nineteen new friendships!

05:01.840 --> 05:02.880
Maud!

05:04.400 --> 05:08.040
I'm so excited to see you,
Pinkie Pie. You too, Applejack.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.320
I hope you had fun
sledding yesterday.

05:10.740 --> 05:11.970
How'd you know that?

05:12.340 --> 05:13.280
Isn't it obvious?

05:14.140 --> 05:16.460
There's specks of Extrusive
Andesite on your hoof.

05:17.540 --> 05:18.620
It's a mountain rock.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.980
Oh... she's good.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.060
How's school going?

05:24.400 --> 05:27.080
If you thought Quartz was high
on the Mohs Hardness Scale,

05:27.360 --> 05:29.020
wait'll I tell you
about Corundum.

05:29.260 --> 05:31.280
I missed you so much!

05:41.140 --> 05:42.960
This place looks amazing!

05:44.220 --> 05:47.840
C'mon everypony, meet my
super-mega-funderful family!

05:57.540 --> 06:00.520
Everypony... meet... everypony!

06:01.720 --> 06:04.420
Surely thy name is
not but Granny Smith.

06:04.960 --> 06:10.020
I am called Igneous Rock Pie,
son of Feldspar Granite Pie.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.730
Thou shalt know me
as Cloudy Quartz.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.470
May providence favor thee
well and to thou comfort

06:17.760 --> 06:19.860
our humble homestead bring.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.500
Y'all gabbin' with
words real funny-like.

06:24.420 --> 06:25.960
What'd ya say them names were:

06:26.340 --> 06:30.300
"Iggy?" And I'm just gonna
call you, "Big Mama Q."

06:31.940 --> 06:34.460
Gaze into the eyes
of Limestone Pie.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.760
Ma and Pa may own this rock
farm, but I keep it running.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.160
Cross me and--

06:39.160 --> 06:41.180
--Aye aye, Captain Grumpy!

06:41.440 --> 06:43.300
No one's gonna mess
with your precious mine.

06:43.860 --> 06:45.420
Or Holder's Boulder!

06:47.100 --> 06:49.080
Everypony stay away
from Holder's Boulder.

06:49.420 --> 06:50.480
There, you happy now?

06:52.060 --> 06:53.560
And you must be...

06:54.540 --> 06:56.660
This is Marble
Pie, my baby sister

06:56.660 --> 06:58.010
who's only a few
minutes younger than me

06:58.010 --> 07:00.560
but she'll always be a baby
to me, isn't that right?

07:00.900 --> 07:02.460
She's so excited
to meet everypony!

07:02.560 --> 07:05.060
Oh, and she wishes you all
a happy Hearth's Warming!

07:07.460 --> 07:08.180
Mmm-hmm.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.840
Guess Pinkie Pie always
did the talkin' for her.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.420
ATTENTION!

07:16.320 --> 07:18.440
What'd I say about the boulder?

07:19.180 --> 07:20.680
I'll just be a second!

07:21.300 --> 07:24.940
Everypony, get settled in.
There's plenty of room upstairs,

07:25.160 --> 07:28.260
and then it's time for
Hearth's Warming Eve Dinner!

07:31.880 --> 07:34.100
So far, so good "cousin!"

07:34.300 --> 07:34.940
Hee Hee!

07:37.680 --> 07:40.420
I can't wait to taste
their fresh sweet rolls.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.880
They're my favorite part of
Hearth's Warming Eve Dinner.

07:43.400 --> 07:47.140
I'm more of a six-layer
bean dip filly, myself.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.220
I love that too! Oh, Applejack,

07:50.480 --> 07:52.580
do you think theirs will
be even better than ours?

07:52.900 --> 07:54.480
Oh, that's a mighty tall order,

07:54.540 --> 07:56.700
but it wouldn't surprise
me in the least.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.280
Are you excited for dinner
time because guess who is?

07:59.560 --> 08:01.200
Spoiler alert: it's ME!

08:15.100 --> 08:19.440
What about hot rolls? And mulled
cider? And double-baked pot-pie?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.660
What about 6-layer bean dip?

08:23.220 --> 08:24.560
We have rock soup.

08:25.580 --> 08:29.140
Potato, po-tah-to!
Double-baked-pot-pie, rock soup!

08:29.480 --> 08:31.640
Dinner is dinner, Am
I right or am I right?

08:33.980 --> 08:36.640
Yeah, um... you know what?

08:36.940 --> 08:40.900
This is what we were
expecting, right everypony?

08:45.340 --> 08:46.420
Heh heh.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.720
Is everything all
right, Applejack?

08:56.040 --> 08:58.340
Of course. I'm just
bein' a rusty fiddle.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.270
Tune me up and let's
get back to dinner!

09:13.960 --> 09:15.100
More rock, please!

09:17.020 --> 09:19.560
Eat up, so we can get to
our Hearth's Warming dolls!

09:20.040 --> 09:21.980
Now that's somethin'
I know all about.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.500
Who wants a Hearth's
Warming doll?

09:29.880 --> 09:33.220
Are you sayin' that rock
is a Hearth's Warming Doll?

09:33.880 --> 09:35.700
Don't be silly, silly.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.980
Our dolls are these
little pieces!

09:40.160 --> 09:41.640
Isn't that right, Marble Pie?

09:42.540 --> 09:43.380
Mm-hm.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.540
Our dolls... are rocks?

09:59.980 --> 10:02.540
Y'all don't have
traditional crocheted dolls

10:02.620 --> 10:04.060
passed down in your family?

10:04.700 --> 10:07.160
Ohhhh, you're just
a frown factory

10:07.160 --> 10:08.880
because you got a weird rock.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.520
Cheer up! I'm sure
you'll do great in the

10:11.520 --> 10:12.780
Flag-Finding Mission.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.480
What-findin' what-now?

10:16.020 --> 10:17.820
Limestone Pie, you're the judge.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.200
Big Mac? Marble
Pie? You're team 1.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.340
Apple Bloom and
Maud? You're team 2.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.060
Ma? Pa? You're gonna
be with Granny Smith.

10:27.800 --> 10:31.480
Don't think of it as "team old,"
think of it as team three.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.630
And I'm with
Applejack, of course!

10:33.820 --> 10:35.120
Since we might be cousins!

10:36.120 --> 10:37.930
So now that we're all split up,

10:38.220 --> 10:39.600
mind tellin' us
what we're doing?

10:40.700 --> 10:42.740
As everypony knows--

10:43.100 --> 10:44.860
STAY OFF HOLDER'S BOULDER!

10:45.280 --> 10:46.120
Sheesh.

10:47.420 --> 10:50.480
When the three tribes
united to form Equestria,

10:50.740 --> 10:53.040
the first flag was
sewn by Nimble Thimble.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.800
It's tradition to raise a
flag on Hearth's Warming

10:56.020 --> 10:57.980
to celebrate that famous day.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.300
But who gets to put the
flag on Holder's Bolder?

11:03.140 --> 11:04.560
You mean on the flagpole?

11:04.820 --> 11:05.580
No, silly!

11:05.680 --> 11:08.780
It goes on the highest point.
And who's the lucky pony?

11:09.520 --> 11:11.480
Traditionally, it's
the youngest...

11:11.480 --> 11:13.100
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, GO!

11:14.860 --> 11:17.380
Pinkie Pie, will you please
tell us what's going on?

11:17.540 --> 11:18.440
I'll explain on the way!

11:18.560 --> 11:19.410
Oh!

11:20.720 --> 11:22.080
I still don't understand.

11:22.620 --> 11:25.720
Earlier today, Limestone
Pie hid an obsidian stone.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.340
Whoever finds it gets
to raise the flag!

11:29.780 --> 11:33.580
It's all just so...
complicated. And "rock-based."

11:33.960 --> 11:36.180
Well, how else would we do it?

11:36.740 --> 11:37.600
I don't know.

11:37.940 --> 11:40.360
I sure hope everypony else
is havin' a better time.

11:41.680 --> 11:42.640
Mmm-hmm.

11:43.380 --> 11:44.140
Eyup.

11:45.420 --> 11:46.560
Mmmmmmm-hmm.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.460
Eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyup.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.240
So, how'd ya meet
this Iggy fella?

11:56.500 --> 11:58.640
We were chosen by
the pairing stone

11:58.760 --> 12:00.810
and betrothed
within a fortnight.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.740
The choosing stone decreed
"thou shalt love one another,"

12:04.940 --> 12:07.120
and lo, it was so.

12:07.980 --> 12:13.040
Hoo-wee. I gotsta look into this
oldfangled choosin' stone thing.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.420
Do you reckon it knows
any Apple farmin' hunks?

12:17.770 --> 12:18.880
Indeed so.

12:20.380 --> 12:21.740
What does the rock look like?

12:22.060 --> 12:23.620
It looks like
something that formed

12:23.620 --> 12:25.540
when volcanic lava
cooled quickly.

12:26.780 --> 12:27.300
Oh.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.780
Have you ever wished you
could turn into a rock?

12:30.100 --> 12:31.960
I had a dream once
I was an apple.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.440
We have a lot in common

12:33.440 --> 12:36.120
when it comes to thinking
about turning into things.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.200
FOUND IT!
FOUND IT! FOUND IT!

12:45.540 --> 12:49.680
A picture? I been lookin'
for a real stone, Pinkie Pie.

12:50.060 --> 12:54.100
Um, that would be weird. Do
you know what this means?

12:54.280 --> 12:57.180
I get to raise the flag! And now
it's time to hide the presents!

12:58.000 --> 12:59.470
Y'all hide your presents?

12:59.780 --> 13:02.560
Of course! What's more fun
than getting a present?

13:02.840 --> 13:04.110
FINDING A PRESENT!

13:04.360 --> 13:06.740
Although most years
nopony finds one.

13:07.460 --> 13:09.480
So nopony gets presents?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.050
Not usually.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.980
So let me get all this straight.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.260
You're only allowed to
eat Rock Soup for dinner.

13:16.540 --> 13:19.640
Then, the pony who finds this
rock gets to raise the flag,

13:19.900 --> 13:22.100
but not really cause you
don't got no flag pole.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.680
And to top it off, you
don't even get presents?

13:25.160 --> 13:28.760
Well, it doesn't sound very
fun when you say it THAT way.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.040
Well, how about
you picture this:

13:31.420 --> 13:36.200
both our families, opening
presents, raising the flag...

13:37.100 --> 13:40.140
Picturing it, loving it!

13:43.640 --> 13:44.980
Goodnight, everypony!

13:45.280 --> 13:46.390
Goodnight, Pinkie Pie!

13:50.480 --> 13:52.160
We gotta do something, y'all.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.030
Pinkie Pie's family's never
had a real Hearth's Warming.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.100
Is that really what she said?

13:57.540 --> 13:59.500
Well, I'm sure it's
what she meant.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.870
These are their traditions.

14:01.870 --> 14:02.640
Eyup.

14:04.060 --> 14:07.260
I know they have their
traditions and we have ours,

14:07.820 --> 14:10.760
but I just want them to see how
much better theirs could be.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.720
Hearth's Warming!

14:18.100 --> 14:19.460
Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Warming!

14:19.940 --> 14:21.320
Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Warming!

14:21.680 --> 14:22.780
Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Wa-

14:23.720 --> 14:25.560
Oh, my, oh my.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.800
What. Happened. To. My. Farm.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.720
It's Hearth's
Warming, Apple style!

14:33.060 --> 14:34.600
We've been doing
everything your way.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.460
I thought we could
mix it up a bit.

14:37.620 --> 14:40.820
Marble Pie, you could raise the
Equestria flag up this pole,

14:40.980 --> 14:42.460
because you're the youngest Pie.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.340
Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up
a meal you'll never forget.

14:46.780 --> 14:50.840
And look, we all get presents
without having to find 'em!

14:54.480 --> 14:57.290
Yeah! This is going to be great!

14:57.580 --> 15:00.700
All the stuff she
said. Right, everypony?

15:00.960 --> 15:05.360
Pinkamina Diane Pie, truly thou
do not favor this madness?

15:06.040 --> 15:09.040
Well, I want to
be one big family.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.640
But what about
what we usually do?

15:12.040 --> 15:17.340
I, um, well? I don't know!
Don't make me choose!

15:17.620 --> 15:19.450
I didn't mean to cause a fuss.

15:19.820 --> 15:22.040
Why don't we just open
presents around the flagpole.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.720
It'll be fun, you'll see.

15:24.140 --> 15:27.550
Excuse me. You planted
your pole on a fault line.

15:41.420 --> 15:45.180
NOOOOOOOO!

15:47.220 --> 15:48.300
Oh boy.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.100
You didn't have to
ask them to leave.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.380
They wanted to go.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.380
We don't need anypony forcing
their way into our family.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.100
This was all a
misunderstanding, everypony.

16:01.220 --> 16:02.320
I know Applejack,

16:02.460 --> 16:05.940
and she'd never do
anything bad to anypony.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.940
Look around, Pinkie Pie.

16:08.180 --> 16:11.230
It's gonna take me ages to get
this rock farm back on track.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.500
And how're we gonna
lift Holder's Boulder?

16:13.780 --> 16:15.470
This is all her fault.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.680
Then it's my fault too.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.680
Probably best if we head
back to Sweet Apple Acres.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.820
Maybe in time we'll
be friends again.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.450
But for the now it's best if
we give them a little space.

16:30.820 --> 16:34.760
I wish we didn't have
to. I really like Maud.

16:35.100 --> 16:38.060
She's sweet once you get
to know her. They all are.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.600
Worst Hearth's Warming ever.

16:44.580 --> 16:47.400
Has anypony seen Applejack?

16:51.700 --> 16:53.780
I really cracked
the corn this time.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.600
I really popped the
piñata this time.

16:57.920 --> 16:58.620
Pinkie Pie?

16:58.760 --> 17:00.680
Ah! What are you
doing here?

17:00.860 --> 17:02.160
What are you
doing here?

17:02.420 --> 17:03.880
I came here to think.

17:04.260 --> 17:06.220
You did? So did I!

17:10.140 --> 17:12.030
I'm too ashamed to
go back up there.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.080
Your family, my family?

17:14.480 --> 17:16.500
They all must think
I'm such a nincompoop.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.120
Aw, no one thinks that.

17:19.640 --> 17:25.520
Pushy, aggressive, mean.
Oh I'm not helping, sorry.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.920
I'm sorry I forced my
traditions over yours.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.280
I don't want you to have to
choose between the family

17:31.280 --> 17:34.020
you were born into, and the
friends who love you like one.

17:34.980 --> 17:39.090
I really hoped we could be
one big family. I guess not.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.460
Don't say that!

17:42.060 --> 17:45.400
I wish I could stay but
I have a train to catch.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.740
Hap... hap... happy
Hearth's Warming.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.080
You, too.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.200
You wanna know why Holder's
Boulder's so dangit important?

18:05.520 --> 18:08.100
Well, now, their great great
great great great grandfather,

18:08.300 --> 18:13.060
Holder Cobblestone, he found
that boulder in a Dragon's nest,

18:13.340 --> 18:14.940
older than time itself.

18:15.340 --> 18:17.520
He built the family
farm around it,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.100
even though it was just
an ordinary rock.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.720
It's always brought
them good luck.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.960
Crickets! That is important.

18:26.340 --> 18:28.660
I got so caught up in the
things they were doin',

18:28.940 --> 18:30.460
I never asked why they did 'em.

18:34.400 --> 18:38.500
"To Applejack, from Pinkie
Pie. ...cousins forever."

18:39.500 --> 18:42.680
You just found your first Pie
Hearth's Warming present ever!

18:44.300 --> 18:47.280
Only Pinkie Pie could hide a
present on a moving train.

18:48.340 --> 18:50.120
What a great tradition!

18:52.660 --> 18:54.260
STOP THE TRAIN!

19:03.120 --> 19:05.760
C'mon, you boulder, c'mon!

19:06.920 --> 19:09.020
I'm pushing as
hard as I can, too.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.980
Oh, it's hopeless.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.660
Need a
little help?

19:17.020 --> 19:18.380
Apples!

19:18.680 --> 19:19.960
What do you want?

19:20.240 --> 19:23.040
I wasn't trying to take
your traditions away;

19:23.340 --> 19:25.080
I was trying to share ours.

19:25.800 --> 19:29.200
I was so focused on us
bein' one big happy family,

19:29.440 --> 19:31.720
I thought we needed the
same traditions right away.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.840
What I shoulda done
is learn about yours

19:35.000 --> 19:36.320
and teach you about ours.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.620
And over time, we'd make
new traditions together.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.740
I'm sorry, y'all.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.720
Well, don't just stand there.

19:48.940 --> 19:50.380
We got a boulder
to move!

19:54.560 --> 19:55.620
And I'm in charge!

20:00.060 --> 20:02.660
I think we just invented our
first combined tradition!

20:02.940 --> 20:05.240
Pushing Holder's Boulder
out of the Quarry!

20:05.900 --> 20:07.700
I can't wait for
Applejack to knock it over

20:07.700 --> 20:09.200
next Hearth's Warming!

20:33.760 --> 20:37.000
Marble Pie, you want to wish Big
Mac a happy Hearth's Warming,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.430
don't you? And you
too, right, Big Mac?

20:39.740 --> 20:40.520
Mm-hm.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.180
Eyup.

20:43.280 --> 20:47.720
Uh, let me see here.
"If thou asketh me...

20:48.460 --> 20:51.610
Thou two art OK-eth in my book."

20:52.120 --> 20:53.720
"Yee...haw?"

20:57.740 --> 20:59.650
Happy Hearth's Warming.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.700
Happy Hearth's
Warming, Pinkie Pie.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.080
Attention, everypony!

21:04.420 --> 21:07.300
Maud wants to sing some Hearth's
Warming carols that she wrote!

21:12.780 --> 21:14.480
The first one is about rocks.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.680
They're all about rocks.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.860
Hearth's Warming is great,

21:21.380 --> 21:22.780
like Calcium Silicate.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.340
What a wonderful day,

21:25.860 --> 21:28.560
as good as Mica or Clay...
