00:06.109 --> 00:07.038
Mail's here!

00:08.388 --> 00:09.256
Please be a "yes".

00:09.313 --> 00:10.033
Please be a "yes".

00:10.251 --> 00:11.178
Please be a "yes".

00:13.443 --> 00:14.610
YES!

00:14.839 --> 00:16.374
She can make it!
She can make it!

00:16.862 --> 00:18.979
Going out on a limb here,
but I'm guessing that

00:18.983 --> 00:21.680
Princess Cadance said she
can come this weekend.

00:22.171 --> 00:24.132
I'm finally going to get to
spend some quality time

00:24.144 --> 00:25.291
with my sister-in-law.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.492
This is the best news EVER!

00:29.923 --> 00:32.472
Um, so sorry for
barging in like this.

00:32.837 --> 00:36.466
But I'm so excited I just
couldn't wait to tell somepony.

00:38.171 --> 00:40.885
The Equestrian Society for the
Preservation of Rare Creatures

00:41.000 --> 00:43.808
has given me permission to
observe the rarest, tiniest,

00:43.890 --> 00:46.913
most adorable magical creatures
in all of Equestria!

00:47.541 --> 00:49.252
The Breezies!

00:49.500 --> 00:52.111
Wow, Fluttershy,
that's fantastic!

00:52.548 --> 00:54.522
Oh! It's not just fantastic;

00:54.833 --> 00:57.635
it just might be
the best news EVER!

01:00.440 --> 01:03.420
I just got the most incredible
mail anypony's ever received

01:03.430 --> 01:05.717
in all of recorded
pony postal history!

01:05.949 --> 01:10.378
It's a flyer about a one-day
sale on used patio furniture!

01:10.677 --> 01:12.501
Ah! Could this day
get any better?

01:12.675 --> 01:13.873
Whoo hoo!

01:21.603 --> 01:26.600

02:01.375 --> 02:03.514
Here's a wrap in
case it gets cold.

02:04.862 --> 02:07.004
And I packed you a basket
of nice fresh apples

02:07.010 --> 02:08.156
in case you get hungry!

02:08.526 --> 02:09.664
Have a great time.

02:09.898 --> 02:10.833
Oh, I will.

02:11.139 --> 02:13.371
And I hope you have
fun with Cadance!

02:14.817 --> 02:16.667
ALL Aboard!

02:20.786 --> 02:23.906
Goodbye! Goodbye, everypony!

02:24.314 --> 02:25.508
Fluttershy!

02:26.917 --> 02:30.762
I'll never
forget you!

02:35.047 --> 02:36.185
Ooh, something floaty!

02:36.366 --> 02:37.319
La la la la la.

02:38.604 --> 02:40.501
I'm a bit nervous
about Cadance's visit.

02:40.774 --> 02:42.626
What could you be
nervous about, Twilight?

02:43.080 --> 02:44.922
Cadance just loves
you to pieces!

02:45.293 --> 02:45.908
I know.

02:46.197 --> 02:48.316
But I really want her visit
to go without a hitch!

02:49.186 --> 02:50.290
Why wouldn't it?

02:50.807 --> 02:53.135
Well, the last few times
we've seen each other

02:53.313 --> 02:55.525
haven't exactly
been "worry free."

02:55.869 --> 02:58.142
The fate of Equestria
has hung in the balance

02:58.152 --> 02:59.711
during most of
your visits with her.

03:00.126 --> 03:00.866
Exactly.

03:01.118 --> 03:02.684
Cadance and I haven't
really had a chance

03:02.694 --> 03:04.448
to just enjoy being
friends again.

03:04.737 --> 03:06.952
Which is why it is so important
that this visit be about

03:06.960 --> 03:09.467
the two of us having some
real quality time together.

03:09.843 --> 03:12.171
I'm guessin' you've got a
plan that'll keep it that way.

03:12.528 --> 03:14.107
The timing couldn't
be more perfect.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.944
For one day only, right
here in Ponyville.

03:17.203 --> 03:19.896
The 'Starswirl the
Bearded' Traveling Museum!

03:20.064 --> 03:22.007
Cadance and I can spend
the whole day looking at

03:22.013 --> 03:23.385
Starswirl the Bearded artifacts.

03:23.797 --> 03:25.748
Sounds like the
perfect, drama-free way

03:25.752 --> 03:27.012
to spend the day
with Cadance.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.051
Not counting the drama
surrounding which of the bells

03:29.065 --> 03:31.071
from his cloak they've
chosen to put on display.

03:31.397 --> 03:33.920
Spoiler alert: It's this one.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.687
Uh, heh heh, sorry.

03:37.847 --> 03:40.794
Something in my throat
like a big ball of "lame?"

03:41.449 --> 03:43.108
I think it sounds delightful.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.678
Yep. Definitely sounds
like you two will have

03:45.681 --> 03:47.666
some real quality
time together.

03:47.921 --> 03:48.694
Exactly.

03:48.901 --> 03:50.388
Just quiet time.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.513
Your Highness.

04:09.742 --> 04:10.835
Your Highness.

04:12.265 --> 04:15.361
I'm teasing, Twilight.
We're sisters-in-law;

04:15.440 --> 04:16.899
we don't have to be so formal.

04:24.072 --> 04:26.485
Knowing you, you've
made some plans.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.888
Boy, have I. Hang on
just one second.

04:30.189 --> 04:30.850
You guys...

04:31.022 --> 04:33.566
Now, now, don't you
worry about a thing!

04:33.793 --> 04:36.360
We'll make sure that
nothing, but nothing,

04:36.374 --> 04:37.970
interferes with your visit.

04:38.288 --> 04:41.235
Go on! Have a hootenanny
with your kinfolk.

04:41.566 --> 04:44.394
You really are the best friends
a pony could ever have.

04:45.045 --> 04:46.520
Coming, Cadance!

04:48.310 --> 04:51.266
Ha! Two sisters-in-law bonding.

04:51.711 --> 04:53.227
Well, I for one am
gonna make sure

04:53.239 --> 04:54.655
that nothing spoils
their day.

04:56.961 --> 04:58.788
<i>What is that thing?</i>

04:58.981 --> 05:00.883
Whatever it is...DUCK!

05:01.320 --> 05:03.432
Rarity, That doesn't look
anything like a duck!

05:07.071 --> 05:08.712
What is that?

05:10.078 --> 05:13.816
<i>Not a what</i>
<i>but a "who," dear.</i>

05:14.167 --> 05:17.471
Oh, no, that sounds like...

05:21.974 --> 05:23.082
DISCORD!

05:28.567 --> 05:30.583
What in tarnation
are you doin' here?

05:30.956 --> 05:33.225
And why the jumpin'
junebugs are you blue?

05:33.557 --> 05:35.836
More like a shade of
cerulean, to be precise.

05:36.115 --> 05:38.753
Whatever color you are
is the color of trouble!

05:39.217 --> 05:41.750
Oh, Rainbow Dash,
I've changed!

05:41.760 --> 05:44.833
Surely you remember
I was reformed

05:44.842 --> 05:49.849
by lovely little Fluttershy!

05:52.113 --> 05:52.708
What are you?

05:52.848 --> 05:53.752
Sick or somethin'?

05:54.163 --> 05:56.249
Well, of course I'm sick!

05:56.548 --> 05:58.236
The blue skin?

05:58.647 --> 05:59.822
These sneezes?

06:00.216 --> 06:02.597
Could somebody find
me a fainting couch?

06:05.705 --> 06:06.245
What?

06:09.920 --> 06:12.039
Charming, thank you.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.677
I can't stop sneezing
and wheezing.

06:14.684 --> 06:17.732
In short, I need help.

06:18.786 --> 06:22.060
If you're so sick, why have
you come here instead of...

06:22.359 --> 06:25.955
y'know, staying home in bed and
getting over your weird illness?

06:30.130 --> 06:32.860
Because this condition
has left me helpless.

06:33.106 --> 06:34.782
Simply helpless.

06:36.989 --> 06:39.642
Why, I can barely lift a spoon.

06:43.892 --> 06:47.123
I came to find the one pony
who truly understands me

06:47.139 --> 06:49.699
and could nurse me
back to health.

06:50.124 --> 06:52.577
Where is that dear,
sweet Fluttershy.

06:52.585 --> 06:53.884
I need attention!

06:53.894 --> 06:55.543
I need some care!

06:55.553 --> 06:56.809
I need...

06:56.813 --> 06:58.273
You need to chill!

06:58.774 --> 06:59.902
Fluttershy's out.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.432
Oh, of course.

07:01.867 --> 07:03.367
Her trip to see the
Breezies.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.486
Ah yes, I had forgotten
that was today.

07:06.005 --> 07:08.103
How do you know
about her trip?

07:08.243 --> 07:10.993
She told me about
it in her last letter.

07:12.587 --> 07:14.427
You and Fluttershy write
each other letters?

07:14.766 --> 07:15.787
Of course we do.

07:16.070 --> 07:17.268
We're friends.

07:17.955 --> 07:20.997
It's just such a shame
that today of all days

07:21.334 --> 07:23.320
is when I really need her.

07:23.566 --> 07:25.371
Oh, well. I know
what to do.

07:25.697 --> 07:28.101
Good thinking, head on
home, put your feet up.

07:28.111 --> 07:29.477
I'm sure eventually
you'll have the strength

07:29.486 --> 07:31.299
to make yourself
soup or something.

07:32.234 --> 07:33.613
No, no, no.

07:33.627 --> 07:37.781
I mean while she's gone, you
ponies can take care of me.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.617
Isn't that what
friends are for?

07:39.906 --> 07:41.771
Taking care of
each other?

07:43.235 --> 07:45.377
Let the healing begin!

07:46.165 --> 07:46.677
Not it!

07:48.185 --> 07:51.383
Well! That's some way to
treat a suffering friend.

07:54.021 --> 07:56.087
Don't you worry, Discord,
I'll give you cuddles

07:56.097 --> 07:58.128
and read stories and
tell you all about me!

07:58.507 --> 08:00.037
I was born on a Tuesday....

08:00.370 --> 08:02.251
You're so sweet to offer.

08:02.499 --> 08:04.595
But Rarity and Applejack
already volunteered

08:04.604 --> 08:06.889
to be my own personal
nursemaids!

08:07.670 --> 08:08.696
We did?

08:09.326 --> 08:12.386
I SO hope you don't
mind, Pinkie Pie.

08:13.196 --> 08:15.221
Well, as a matter of
fact, I most certainly...

08:16.257 --> 08:19.266
Hey! Who keeps throwing away
these perfectly good balloons?

08:20.573 --> 08:21.836
That joker's
up to somethin'.

08:22.103 --> 08:24.271
And whatever it is, we're
gonna keep it as far away

08:24.288 --> 08:26.442
from Twilight and Princess
Cadance as possible.

08:29.428 --> 08:30.039
You're right.

08:30.273 --> 08:32.589
We promised we wouldn't let
anything ruin their visit.

08:32.954 --> 08:35.360
Although I do so wish that
"anything" had turned out

08:35.371 --> 08:36.544
to be something else.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.626
Did I hear you two talking about
Princess Cadance's visit

08:40.636 --> 08:42.794
with Princess Twilight?

08:43.473 --> 08:44.220
Maybe.

08:44.645 --> 08:46.784
Fluttershy had mentioned
that those two

08:46.790 --> 08:47.836
were getting together today.

08:48.751 --> 08:50.218
How wonderful for them both.

08:50.425 --> 08:53.121
It is so rare that those two
get to see one another.

08:53.447 --> 08:56.019
I don't know about you, but I
sometimes wonder how close

08:56.025 --> 08:57.143
they could actually be.

08:57.151 --> 09:00.515
<i>All those years apart</i>
<i>before being reunited?</i>

09:01.315 --> 09:02.745
They're plenty close.

09:02.940 --> 09:05.490
And if they're not, this rare
opportunity to focus

09:05.504 --> 09:07.937
on their friendship will
certainly bring them closer.

09:08.282 --> 09:09.139
Unless...

09:09.143 --> 09:10.175
Don't even
think about it.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.738
They mustn't be disturbed.

09:11.836 --> 09:13.086
Disturb them?

09:13.293 --> 09:14.308
Why I wouldn't dream of it.

09:14.468 --> 09:16.840
Not when I have two such
dear friends of my own

09:16.952 --> 09:18.784
who have already offered
to take care of me.

09:19.077 --> 09:20.499
And at such peril.

09:21.584 --> 09:23.356
This flu of mine is highly...

09:26.327 --> 09:27.525
Contagious.

09:32.731 --> 09:35.594
Oh no! I've gotten
you both sick.

09:36.109 --> 09:40.485
Whomever shall I turn to
now in my time of need?

09:44.589 --> 09:47.486
A whole day to celebrate
Starswirl the Bearded.

09:47.832 --> 09:48.975
What could be better?

09:49.264 --> 09:51.200
Absolutely nothing!

09:52.981 --> 09:55.006
Is that the candlestick
he used to light the way

09:55.016 --> 09:56.989
when he was exploring the
caverns of Maretania?

09:57.285 --> 09:58.550
It sure is.

09:58.749 --> 10:01.361
Oh, I can't believe I'm getting
to see it in real life!

10:12.150 --> 10:14.532
Discord! What are
you doing here?

10:14.885 --> 10:20.487
Oh, dear, dear Princesses,
I'm sorry to say I'm sick.

10:23.313 --> 10:24.421
Blue Flu.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.966
Blue Flu?

10:26.427 --> 10:29.404
I fear I've already given it
to poor Applejack and Rarity.

10:35.225 --> 10:36.335
Magic health bubble.

10:36.801 --> 10:37.771
Good thinking.

10:38.160 --> 10:38.973
Indeed.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.790
How would Twilight
nurse me back to health

10:40.800 --> 10:42.366
if she was sick, too?

10:42.885 --> 10:44.423
You will be letting
me stay at your place

10:44.435 --> 10:46.093
until I'm all
better, won't you?

10:46.641 --> 10:47.578
Stay?

10:47.838 --> 10:48.755
With me?

10:49.229 --> 10:51.397
Uh, now is not
really the best time.

10:51.699 --> 10:53.297
Though I'm sure you
already knew that.

10:53.939 --> 10:56.130
But taking in the sick
and the desperate:

10:56.339 --> 10:58.085
isn't that what
Fluttershy would do?

10:58.497 --> 11:02.078
Isn't "helping" something
that friends do for friends?

11:04.113 --> 11:05.022
Unless, of course,

11:05.412 --> 11:07.869
you're really saying that
you're not my friend.

11:10.606 --> 11:12.308
No. That is not
what I'm saying.

11:12.848 --> 11:15.006
Oh, how elated I
am to hear that.

11:16.366 --> 11:18.480
Shall the three of us
head back to your place?

11:18.840 --> 11:21.180
I don't want to get
anypony else sick.

11:21.215 --> 11:23.459
I guess we don't have
much choice.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.130
Carry me?

11:27.921 --> 11:28.979
It isn't far.

11:29.373 --> 11:31.018
I think you can manage.

11:31.551 --> 11:32.682
Oh. poo

11:38.520 --> 11:39.855
Need anything else?

11:40.362 --> 11:42.280
Just knowing that I have
a good friend like you

11:42.737 --> 11:45.830
to take care of me has
made me feel better already.

11:46.893 --> 11:49.566
I'll be fine here on my own.

11:51.681 --> 11:53.765
Oh. Just before you go.

11:54.156 --> 11:57.925
Just a little, small request.

11:59.896 --> 12:01.334
It's going to be fine.

12:01.676 --> 12:03.032
We'll just get him
what he wants

12:03.041 --> 12:05.188
and be back to the
exhibit in no time.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.276
What was it that you needed?

12:07.664 --> 12:09.982
<i>♪ A little glass of</i>
<i>water, please? ♪</i>

12:10.119 --> 12:12.345

Oops. Sorry.

14:12.554 --> 14:13.806
All right. This
is ridiculous.

14:14.142 --> 14:16.044
How did you even
catch this flu?

14:16.530 --> 14:18.238
Inadequate hoof
and claw washing?

14:18.729 --> 14:20.407
There must be some
way to just cure you.

14:20.645 --> 14:23.223
There has to be a spell or
a remedy in one of my books.

14:23.691 --> 14:25.342
<i>There is one way!</i>

14:25.779 --> 14:28.526
And you didn't think to
mention it earlier?

14:29.008 --> 14:30.599
Slipped my mind.

14:31.385 --> 14:33.598
<i>On a hill at the very</i>
<i>edge of Equestria,</i>

14:33.754 --> 14:36.442
<i>there grows an</i>
<i>exquisite magic flower.</i>

14:36.920 --> 14:39.834
<i>Pick the flower as it</i>
<i>drops its petals at sunset.</i>

14:40.351 --> 14:42.493
<i>Then you can make a</i>
<i>magical, soothing elixir</i>

14:42.503 --> 14:44.612
<i>to cure the Blue Flu.</i>

14:46.899 --> 14:49.303
I suppose you have a good
reason you didn't bother

14:49.313 --> 14:50.298
to go get this flower

14:50.302 --> 14:51.896
as soon as you
realized you were sick?

14:52.364 --> 14:54.718
Well, I couldn't travel
that far in my condition.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.012
By the time I got
there, I'd be too weak

14:57.143 --> 14:59.397
to even attempt to
retrieve the flower.

15:00.497 --> 15:03.174
So where exactly are
Cadance and I headed?

15:04.031 --> 15:07.529
Well, you want to head north,
turn left at the--Oh.

15:08.439 --> 15:10.741
You know, it would
be much easier

15:10.755 --> 15:12.600
if I took you
there myself.

15:12.934 --> 15:16.378
I thought you were in
"no condition" to travel.

15:17.379 --> 15:18.134
I'm not.

15:18.374 --> 15:20.160
We'll need to make
some arrangements.

15:30.066 --> 15:30.981
Doing OK there?

15:31.930 --> 15:34.286
To be honest, I'm a
little out of practice

15:34.294 --> 15:35.516
when it comes to flying.

15:35.799 --> 15:37.882
<i>Well! Then lucky for you,</i>
<i>we're here.</i>

15:43.244 --> 15:44.813
It's just at the
top of that hill.

15:49.660 --> 15:50.948
I'm really sorry
about this.

15:51.371 --> 15:53.356
All I wanted was for us
to have some peaceful,

15:53.363 --> 15:54.468
quality time together.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.486
I know. I was looking
forward to it, too.

16:03.246 --> 16:04.173
This is the top.

16:04.491 --> 16:05.863
But where's that flower?

16:14.844 --> 16:15.274
Oh.

16:15.861 --> 16:16.282
Come on.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.460
If we hurry, we can still
have some time together.

16:26.097 --> 16:28.786
One last pull.

16:33.582 --> 16:36.487
Whew! Let's get Discord and
this flower back home,

16:36.831 --> 16:37.974
then all our problems...

16:37.986 --> 16:39.319
What in Equestria?

17:01.086 --> 17:03.059
Twilight! Help!

17:03.662 --> 17:06.382
Get your coils off
my sister-in-law!

17:12.751 --> 17:13.629
Aaahh!

17:18.234 --> 17:20.809
Let go of my sister-in-law!

17:22.349 --> 17:23.133
Thanks!

17:23.520 --> 17:24.583
Don't thank me yet!

17:35.666 --> 17:37.516
Just a little more.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.883
And for good measure.

17:49.613 --> 17:50.448
Are you OK?

17:51.779 --> 17:54.433
Yes. Better than
OK, actually.

17:54.868 --> 17:56.766
Then let's get Discord
back to Ponyville,

17:56.862 --> 17:58.848
make that elixir, and
finally get a chance

17:58.850 --> 18:00.835
to spend some quality
time together!

18:05.203 --> 18:06.854
<i>To the ends of Equestria!</i>

18:07.120 --> 18:09.479
To face such great danger!

18:09.650 --> 18:12.544
And she did it for me.
She did it all for me!

18:12.550 --> 18:14.316
For me! For me!

18:20.052 --> 18:20.840
YOU...

18:21.371 --> 18:21.980
WERE...

18:22.401 --> 18:23.155
FAKING?

18:23.576 --> 18:24.454
I was.

18:24.682 --> 18:26.708
But I had a very
good reason.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.123
We're listening.

18:29.623 --> 18:31.941
Well, I was in my
thinking tree.

18:32.423 --> 18:34.786
That's where I do most of
my really deep thinking.

18:35.457 --> 18:37.067
I was there and I
said to myself I said.

18:37.375 --> 18:41.077
Discord, your friend Twilight
says that she's your pal,

18:41.340 --> 18:44.757
but she never writes and she
never pops in for a visit.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.140
I don't even know
where you live.

18:46.741 --> 18:48.565
Now that she's a Princess,

18:48.573 --> 18:51.071
<i>maybe she's decided that</i>
<i>she's too good for you.</i>

18:51.594 --> 18:53.426
I have never considered
myself too good--

18:53.436 --> 18:54.741
But how was I supposed to know

18:54.983 --> 18:57.797
for sure that I'm
truly still friends

18:57.804 --> 19:00.154
with one of the most
important ponies around?

19:00.638 --> 19:01.502
I'm not more--

19:01.787 --> 19:04.487
By seeing if you would go
to the ends of Equestria

19:04.686 --> 19:06.130
for me, of course!

19:06.587 --> 19:08.040
Which you did. Literally.

19:08.466 --> 19:13.104
Congratulations, Twilight,
you passed my friendship test!

19:20.005 --> 19:21.379
Why the angry eyes?

19:21.711 --> 19:23.223
You love passing tests.

19:23.559 --> 19:26.310
It's not because my little exam
put a damper on your visit

19:26.325 --> 19:27.797
with Princess Cadance, is it?

19:28.113 --> 19:30.054
Made it so that there was
no time for you two

19:30.060 --> 19:32.803
to focus on your friendship?

19:33.588 --> 19:35.744
You didn't put a damper
on our visit at all.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.461
I didn't?
He didn't?

19:38.009 --> 19:40.480
Spending the day at the
Starswirl the Bearded exhibit

19:40.497 --> 19:43.541
would have been more
relaxing, but to be honest,

19:43.553 --> 19:45.761
relaxation is the
last thing I need.

19:46.308 --> 19:46.967
It is?

19:47.373 --> 19:48.511
Don't get me wrong.

19:48.665 --> 19:50.977
Life in the Crystal
Empire is wonderful,

19:51.414 --> 19:54.821
but it's become a
little... predictable.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.697
I enjoy a little
excitement now and then.

19:58.325 --> 20:00.323
Getting to face all
these challenges today

20:00.331 --> 20:01.654
was just what I needed.

20:02.025 --> 20:05.164
And facing them with you just
made me realize even more

20:05.174 --> 20:08.193
how lucky I am to have
somepony like you as a friend.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.781
We may not see each
other very often,

20:13.797 --> 20:16.409
but I know you'll always
be there when I need you.

20:17.184 --> 20:19.166
Just like she was
there for you, Discord.

20:19.535 --> 20:21.159
Yes. She's a
real sweetheart.

20:21.162 --> 20:23.486
We're all so lucky to
have her in our lives.

20:28.706 --> 20:30.083
What in the world?

20:42.037 --> 20:44.534
<i>I think it's pretty clear that</i>
<i>my visit with Cadance</i>

20:44.540 --> 20:46.538
didn't go quite the
way I expected.

20:47.205 --> 20:49.841
But in the end, I realized that
when you're with a good friend,

20:50.191 --> 20:53.164
even the most chaotic day can
end up being a great experience

20:53.174 --> 20:54.238
that brings you closer.

20:54.948 --> 20:56.913
Wouldn't you agree, Discord?

20:57.834 --> 20:59.358
Yes, Twilight.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.468
I don't wanna go sayin'
you got what you deserved.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.694
Well, I have no
trouble saying it.

21:05.123 --> 21:06.542
You got what you
deserved!

21:06.692 --> 21:07.574
Now, now.

21:07.863 --> 21:09.180
He's learned his lesson.

21:09.516 --> 21:11.728
Isn't that right,
my little patient?

21:12.093 --> 21:14.710
I'm so glad that you're back
from your trip, Fluttershy.

21:14.965 --> 21:17.959
Just your presence here is
making me feel so much better.

21:19.315 --> 21:20.813
I was just wondering.

21:21.096 --> 21:23.802
Could I trouble you for
just one more thing?

21:24.236 --> 21:24.825
No!

21:25.399 --> 21:26.171
What?

21:26.181 --> 21:30.706
I was simply going to ask for
a teeny tiny glass of water.
