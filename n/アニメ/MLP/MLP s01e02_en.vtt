00:03.288 --> 00:06.447
Elements of Harmony...
See: Mare in the Moon?

00:06.463 --> 00:08.041
But that's just an old ponies' tale!

00:08.190 --> 00:10.133
She will bring about nighttime eternal!

00:10.151 --> 00:12.711
It's imperative that
the Princess is told right away.

00:13.323 --> 00:15.902
See? I knew she would wanna
take immediate action.

00:16.061 --> 00:20.127
My dear Twilight. There is more to
a young pony's life than studying.

00:20.370 --> 00:21.761
Make some friends!

00:23.597 --> 00:26.329
All the ponies in this town are CRAZY!

00:27.756 --> 00:29.317
I hope the Princess was right.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.091
She's gone!

00:31.654 --> 00:34.419
Oh no. Nightmare Moon!

01:17.842 --> 01:21.075
Seize her! Only she knows
where the Princess is!

01:21.637 --> 01:23.991
Stand back, you foals!

01:31.587 --> 01:32.645
Come back here!

01:34.885 --> 01:37.412
Nighttime? Forever?

01:39.694 --> 01:41.101
Where's she going?

01:43.367 --> 01:46.167
We gotta stop Nightmare...!

01:48.835 --> 01:53.460
You've been up all night, Spike.
You are a baby dragon after all.

01:57.973 --> 01:59.638
Elements, elements, elements...

02:00.302 --> 02:03.345
How can I stop Nightmare Moon
without the Elements of Harmony?!

02:03.346 --> 02:05.894
And just what are the Elements of Harmony?!

02:05.895 --> 02:08.341
And how did you know about
Nightmare Moon, huh?

02:08.342 --> 02:09.742
Are you a spy?

02:11.261 --> 02:14.597
Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy.

02:14.953 --> 02:18.943
But she sure knows what's going on.
Don't you, Twilight?

02:21.919 --> 02:24.252
I read all about the
prediction of Nightmare Moon.

02:24.288 --> 02:28.590
Some mysterious objects called the Elements of
Harmony are the only things that can stop her.

02:28.812 --> 02:33.010
But I don't know what they are. Where to
find them. I don't even know what they do!

02:33.170 --> 02:35.423
The Elements of Harmony: A Reference Guide.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.478
How did you find that?!

02:37.616 --> 02:39.436
IT WAS UNDER "E"!

02:44.227 --> 02:47.482
"There are six Elements of Harmony,
but only five are known..."

02:47.792 --> 02:51.010
"Kindness, Laughter, Generosity,
Honesty and Loyalty."

02:51.296 --> 02:53.617
"The sixth is a complete mystery."

02:53.948 --> 02:56.847
"It is said, the last known
location of the five Elements..."

02:57.080 --> 03:02.708
"...was in the ancient castle of the royal
pony sisters. It is located in what is now..."

03:03.684 --> 03:06.615
The Everfree Forest!

03:11.001 --> 03:12.605
Whee! Let's go!

03:13.072 --> 03:14.294
Not so fast!

03:14.396 --> 03:19.717
Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd
really rather do this on my own.

03:19.836 --> 03:25.037
No can do, sugar cube. We sure ain't lettin' any
friend of ours goin' to that creepy place alone.

03:25.110 --> 03:28.309
We're stickin' to you like
caramel to candy apple.

03:29.364 --> 03:32.429
Especially if there's candy apples in there.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.259
What? Those things are good!

03:42.293 --> 03:45.298
So none of you have been in here before?

03:46.148 --> 03:50.260
Heavens no! Just look at it - it's dreadful!

03:50.267 --> 03:54.713
And it ain't natural. Folk say
it don't work the same as Equestria.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.178
What's that supposed to mean?

03:56.372 --> 04:00.937
Nopony knows. You know why?

04:00.938 --> 04:02.397
Rainbow! Quit it!

04:02.524 --> 04:04.950
Cause everypony who's ever come in...

04:04.951 --> 04:08.188
...has never... come... OUT!

04:10.257 --> 04:11.886
Fluttershy! Quick!

04:12.063 --> 04:13.239
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...

04:23.824 --> 04:25.794
Hold on! I'm a-comin'!

04:25.868 --> 04:28.010
Applejack! What do I do?!

04:32.429 --> 04:33.439
Let go.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.457
-Are you crazy?!
-No, I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.

04:37.650 --> 04:38.835
That's not true!

04:38.898 --> 04:43.002
Now listen here. What I'm sayin'
to you is the honest truth.

04:43.003 --> 04:45.316
Let go and you'll be safe.

04:55.504 --> 05:00.111
Sorry girls. I'm not used to holding
anything more than a bunny or two.

05:11.613 --> 05:13.659
And once Pinkie and Rarity
were saved, WHOA...

05:13.853 --> 05:18.775
Me and Fluttershy loop-de-looped around and WHAM!
Got you right in a nick of time.

05:18.776 --> 05:22.928
Yes, Rainbow, I was there.
And I'm very grateful, but we gotta...

05:23.379 --> 05:24.810
A manticore!

05:26.791 --> 05:28.493
We've gotta get past him!

05:30.963 --> 05:32.572
Take that, you ruffian!

05:35.177 --> 05:36.728
MY HAIR!

05:38.807 --> 05:39.757
Wait...

05:42.114 --> 05:44.853
YEEHAW! Get along, little doggie!

05:45.041 --> 05:45.917
Wait...

05:49.010 --> 05:51.751
-All yours, partner.
-I'm on it!

05:52.085 --> 05:52.865
Wait...!

05:57.413 --> 05:58.335
Rainbow!

06:07.120 --> 06:09.004
WAIT!!!

06:14.556 --> 06:16.343
Shhh... It's okay.

06:21.721 --> 06:24.523
Oh, you poor, poor little baby.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.195
Little?

06:26.269 --> 06:29.416
Now this might hurt for juuust a second.

06:31.094 --> 06:32.795
Fluttershy!

06:35.834 --> 06:42.076
Are you just a little baby kitty, aren't you?
Yesh you are, yesh you are.

06:43.655 --> 06:45.379
How did you know about the thorn?

06:45.380 --> 06:50.689
I didn't. Sometimes we all just
need to be shown a little kindness.

07:00.880 --> 07:04.135
My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck.

07:06.607 --> 07:08.244
Well, I didn't mean that literally.

07:08.344 --> 07:11.782
That ancient ruin could be right in front
of our faces and we wouldn't even know it!

07:16.033 --> 07:19.009
Oh wait. I think I stepped in somethin'.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.161
It's just mud.

07:42.149 --> 07:44.923
Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run!

07:45.009 --> 07:47.244
Oh, girls. Don't you see...?

07:47.914 --> 07:53.516
<i>When I was a little filly and
the sun was going dooown...</i>

07:53.650 --> 07:54.573
Tell me she's not...

07:54.574 --> 07:59.991
<i>The darkness and the shadows, they
would always make me frooown...</i>

08:00.044 --> 08:01.151
She is.

08:01.152 --> 08:05.233
<i>I'd hide under my pillow
from what I thought I saw,</i>

08:05.384 --> 08:09.715
<i>But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way
to deal with fears at aaall!</i>

08:09.867 --> 08:10.568
Then what is?

08:10.583 --> 08:15.458
<i>She said: Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall,
learn to face your fears.</i>

08:15.611 --> 08:20.316
<i>You'll see that they can't hurt you,
just laugh to make them disappear.</i>

08:24.845 --> 08:27.899
<i>Sooo, giggle at the ghostly!</i>

08:28.141 --> 08:29.995
<i>Guffaw at the grossly!</i>

08:30.381 --> 08:32.411
<i>Crack up at the creepy!</i>

08:32.501 --> 08:34.299
<i>Whoop it up with the weepy!</i>

08:34.763 --> 08:36.533
<i>Chortle at the cooky!</i>

08:36.840 --> 08:38.967
<i>Snortle at the spooky!</i>

08:39.121 --> 08:41.252
And tell that big dumb scary face
to take a hike and leave you alone...

08:41.253 --> 08:45.752
Andifhethinkshecanscareyouthenhesgotanotherthink
comingandtheveryideaofsuchathingjustmakesyouwanna...

08:48.039 --> 08:54.213
<i>LAAAUGH!</i>

09:08.252 --> 09:10.180
Where are we gonna cross *this*?

09:18.129 --> 09:20.872
What a world, what a world...!

09:20.911 --> 09:23.648
Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?

09:23.849 --> 09:28.215
Well, I don't know. I was just sitting
here, minding my own business...

09:28.216 --> 09:32.804
...when this tacky little cloud of
purple smoke just whisked past me...

09:32.805 --> 09:35.515
...and tore a half of my beloved mustache...

09:35.627 --> 09:37.349
...CLEAN OFF!

09:37.436 --> 09:41.177
And now I look simply horrid!

09:44.099 --> 09:48.030
-Oh, gimme a break!
-That's what all the fuss is about?

09:48.477 --> 09:52.735
Why, of course it is!
How can you be so insensitive?

09:52.821 --> 09:57.845
Oh, just look at him.
Such lovely luminescent scales...!

09:58.517 --> 10:00.080
I know.

10:00.170 --> 10:02.702
...and your expertly coiffed mane...!

10:03.080 --> 10:05.360
Oh, I know, I know.

10:05.407 --> 10:07.911
...your fabulous manicure...!

10:07.912 --> 10:10.323
It's so true!

10:10.377 --> 10:13.610
All ruined without your beautiful mustache!

10:13.670 --> 10:16.680
It's true, I'm hideous!

10:16.778 --> 10:21.811
I simply cannot let such a crime
against fabulosity go uncorrected!

10:24.571 --> 10:26.067
What did you do that for?!

10:28.087 --> 10:29.542
Rarity, what are you...

10:45.686 --> 10:49.836
My mustache! How wonderful!

10:49.872 --> 10:51.836
You look smashing!

10:51.837 --> 10:54.651
Oh, Rarity! Your beautiful tail!

10:54.903 --> 10:59.042
Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are
in the season.

10:59.043 --> 11:01.438
Besides, it'll grow back.

11:02.533 --> 11:04.517
So would the mustache...

11:05.904 --> 11:08.176
We can cross now! Let's go...!

11:09.729 --> 11:12.078
Allow me.

11:18.516 --> 11:23.303
There it is! The ruin that holds
the Elements of Harmony! We made it!

11:24.140 --> 11:26.515
Twilight! Wait for us!

11:26.553 --> 11:27.691
We're almost there!

11:32.496 --> 11:35.046
What's with you and falling off cliffs today?

11:36.182 --> 11:37.275
Now what?!

11:38.039 --> 11:40.802
-Duh!
-Oh yeah!

11:45.464 --> 11:50.860
-Rainbow...! Rainbow...!
-Who's there?

11:51.179 --> 11:54.051
I ain't scared of you! Show yourself!

11:54.215 --> 11:59.103
We've been eagerly awaiting the arrival
of the best flyer in Equestria.

11:59.451 --> 12:02.897
-Who?
-Why you, of course!

12:02.973 --> 12:05.962
Really?! I mean... Oh yeah! Me!

12:05.986 --> 12:09.462
Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling
the Wonderbolts that, would ya?

12:09.567 --> 12:12.865
'Cos I've been trying to get
into that group for, like, ever!

12:12.912 --> 12:16.475
No, Rainbow Dash. We want you to join us!

12:16.575 --> 12:18.173
The Shadowbolts!

12:18.794 --> 12:21.775
We're the greatest aerial
team in the Everfree Forest.

12:21.978 --> 12:25.370
And soon we will be the greatest in all Equestria.

12:26.051 --> 12:28.669
But first, we need a captain.

12:30.596 --> 12:32.956
-The most magnificent...
-Yep!

12:33.107 --> 12:34.430
-...swiftest...
-Yes!

12:34.625 --> 12:38.366
-...bravest flyer in all the land!
-Yes! It's all true!

12:38.552 --> 12:39.586
We need...

12:40.131 --> 12:41.243
...you!

12:42.377 --> 12:43.694
Sign me up!

12:43.695 --> 12:46.417
Just let me tie this bridge real
quick and then we have a deal.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.836
No! It's them or us!

12:50.148 --> 12:52.973
Rainbow! What's taking so long?

12:53.318 --> 12:54.126
Oh no.

12:54.892 --> 12:56.410
Rainbow!

12:59.304 --> 13:00.749
Don't listen to them!

13:02.972 --> 13:04.017
Well...?

13:04.350 --> 13:05.330
You...

13:06.707 --> 13:08.979
Thank you! For the offer, I mean.

13:10.601 --> 13:13.411
But... I'm afraid I have to say no.

13:23.591 --> 13:26.765
See? I'd never leave my friends hanging!

13:32.003 --> 13:33.439
Wow.

13:33.650 --> 13:37.130
Come on, Twilight! Isn't this
what you've been waitin' for?

13:37.725 --> 13:41.283
The Elements of Harmony! We've found them!

13:44.462 --> 13:46.663
Careful... Careful...!

13:47.332 --> 13:49.343
One, two, three, four...

13:49.597 --> 13:50.903
There's only five!

13:51.327 --> 13:52.599
Where's the sixth?

13:52.794 --> 13:55.307
The book said: "When the five are present..."

13:55.308 --> 13:58.069
"...a spark will cause
the sixth Element to be revealed."

13:58.120 --> 14:00.400
What in the hay is that supposed to mean?

14:00.451 --> 14:02.255
I'm not sure, but I have an idea.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.714
Stand back. I don't know what will happen.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.651
Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate.

14:23.410 --> 14:24.855
Twilight!

14:27.270 --> 14:28.341
The Elements!

14:37.407 --> 14:40.473
-Twilight! Where are you?!
-Look!

14:42.059 --> 14:43.051
Come on!

14:56.724 --> 14:59.455
You're kidding. You're kidding, right?

15:14.665 --> 15:16.048
Just one spark...

15:16.486 --> 15:18.180
Come on, come on!

15:29.050 --> 15:30.844
No! No!

15:35.177 --> 15:37.970
But... where's the sixth Element?!

15:44.001 --> 15:47.576
You little foal! Thinking you could defeat me!?

15:47.763 --> 15:52.108
Now you will never see your Princess.
Or your sun!

15:52.328 --> 15:56.030
THE NIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER!

16:07.014 --> 16:10.752
You think you can destroy
the Elements of Harmony just like that?

16:11.045 --> 16:12.454
Well, you're wrong.

16:12.467 --> 16:16.694
Because the spirits of
the Elements of Harmony are right HERE!

16:19.788 --> 16:20.611
What?

16:20.687 --> 16:24.615
Applejack, who reassured me when I was
in doubt represents the spirit of...

16:24.738 --> 16:26.138
Honesty!

16:27.079 --> 16:31.908
Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with
her compassion represents the spirit of...

16:32.080 --> 16:33.480
Kindness!

16:33.918 --> 16:39.100
Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in
the face of danger represents the spirit of...

16:39.282 --> 16:40.682
Laughter!

16:42.189 --> 16:47.773
Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with
a meaningful gift represents the spirit of...

16:47.964 --> 16:49.364
Generosity!

16:49.899 --> 16:55.348
And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon
her friends for her own heart's desire
represents the spirit of...

16:55.637 --> 16:57.037
Loyalty!

16:57.311 --> 17:02.005
The spirits of these five ponies got us
through every challenge you threw at us!

17:02.091 --> 17:05.309
You still don't have the sixth Element!
The spark didn't work!

17:05.310 --> 17:07.999
But it did. A different kind of spark.

17:08.650 --> 17:14.039
I felt it the very moment I realized how
happy I was to hear you... To see you...

17:14.342 --> 17:16.021
How much I cared about you!

17:16.385 --> 17:20.738
The spark ignited inside me
when I realized that you all...

17:21.357 --> 17:23.251
...are my friends!

17:31.908 --> 17:35.060
You see, Nightmare Moon, when those
Elements are ignited by the...

17:35.461 --> 17:38.557
...the spark that resides in the heart of us all...

17:38.596 --> 17:41.150
...it creates the sixth Element: The Element of...

17:41.332 --> 17:42.732
Magic!

17:56.544 --> 17:59.386
NOOOOOO!!!

18:16.015 --> 18:17.500
My head...

18:17.999 --> 18:19.914
Everypony okay?

18:20.171 --> 18:21.722
Oh, thank goodness!

18:22.221 --> 18:24.760
Why Rarity, it's so lovely!

18:24.808 --> 18:27.951
I know! I'll never part with it again!

18:28.064 --> 18:32.835
No. Your necklace. It looks
just like your cutie mark.

18:34.420 --> 18:35.824
So does yours!

18:37.407 --> 18:39.123
Look at mine! Look at mine!

18:39.461 --> 18:41.017
Oooh yeah!

18:42.513 --> 18:46.229
Gee, Twilight! I though you were
just spoutin' a lot of hooey.

18:46.551 --> 18:50.157
But I reckon we really do represent
the elements of friendship.

18:50.192 --> 18:51.564
Indeed you do.

19:08.521 --> 19:10.275
Princess Celestia!

19:10.276 --> 19:13.529
Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student.

19:14.223 --> 19:15.734
I knew you could do it.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.777
But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.

19:18.966 --> 19:23.061
I told you that you needed to
make some friends. Nothing more.

19:23.408 --> 19:25.634
I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return...

19:25.858 --> 19:29.574
...and I knew it was you who had
the magic inside to defeat her.

19:29.873 --> 19:33.445
But you could not unleash it until you
let true friendship into your heart.

19:34.913 --> 19:36.923
Now if only another will as well.

19:37.597 --> 19:39.114
Princess Luna...

19:40.436 --> 19:43.526
It is been a thousand years since
I have seen you like this.

19:44.199 --> 19:49.383
Time to put our differences behind us.
We were meant to rule together, little sister.

19:49.470 --> 19:50.567
Sister?!

19:50.645 --> 19:52.746
Will you accept my friendship?

19:58.488 --> 20:02.181
I'm so sorry! I missed you so much, big sister!

20:03.269 --> 20:04.837
I've missed you, too.

20:09.551 --> 20:12.034
...Hey! You know what this calls for?

20:12.480 --> 20:14.051
A PARTY!

20:36.205 --> 20:38.548
Why so glum, my faithful student?

20:38.879 --> 20:43.870
Are you not happy that Equestria is complete?
And you can return to your studies in Canterlot?

20:44.131 --> 20:50.406
That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful
it is to have friends, I have to leave them.

20:51.594 --> 20:53.145
Spike! Take a note, please.

20:53.518 --> 20:56.912
I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree...

20:57.166 --> 21:02.190
...that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall
take on a new mission for Equestria.

21:02.221 --> 21:04.967
She must continue to study
the magic of friendship.

21:04.990 --> 21:10.624
She must report to me her findings
from her new home in Ponyville.

21:12.842 --> 21:17.827
Oh thank you, Princess Celestia!
I'll study harder than ever before!

21:23.469 --> 21:29.471
Isn't this exciting? AreyouexcitedcauseImexcited
