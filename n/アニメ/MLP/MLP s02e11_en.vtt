WEBVTT

00:11.688 --> 00:13.515
We're getting closer.

00:13.516 --> 00:15.319
I can hardly wait!

00:15.320 --> 00:18.754
I'm so excited I...
I feel like shouting.

00:18.755 --> 00:20.719
Woohoo.

00:20.720 --> 00:24.101
Whoo wee! Canterlot, here we come!

00:24.102 --> 00:27.165
Oh, I do hope I look festive enough.

00:27.258 --> 00:30.067
There it is! Canterlot!

00:30.068 --> 00:32.612
Ooh!

00:34.901 --> 00:38.241
Oh, isn't Canterlot wonderful
this time of year?

00:38.416 --> 00:41.927
Yeah. I wish it was Hearth's
Warming Eve every day.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.246
There's so much to look at here.

00:44.247 --> 00:47.157
I feel like my durn eyes are gonna
pop right outta my head.

00:47.158 --> 00:48.190
I have an idea.

00:48.191 --> 00:51.810
Let's play "I spy with my little eye"
as we walk. I'll go first.

00:51.811 --> 00:53.435
I spy...

00:53.848 --> 00:55.559
...an eight foot candy cane.

00:55.603 --> 00:57.275
I spy a snowpony.

00:58.807 --> 01:01.929
I spy somepony eating
a gingerbread house.

01:04.243 --> 01:05.883
And it's me!

01:58.763 --> 02:00.988
I can't believe that
Princess Celestia chose us...

02:00.989 --> 02:03.466
...to put on the most
important play of the season.

02:03.467 --> 02:07.124
Do you guys know what
an honor this is? For all of us?

02:07.125 --> 02:10.007
Oh. I wish she hadn't
honored me quite so much.

02:10.008 --> 02:14.048
I can't go on stage. I don't want
everypony looking at me!

02:14.416 --> 02:17.676
Fluttershy, darling, there is
nothing to feel nervous about.

02:17.677 --> 02:18.342
No?

02:19.191 --> 02:23.136
Of course not. All across
Equestria ponies are preparing...

02:23.137 --> 02:26.421
...their own pageants for Hearth's
Warming Eve in their own towns.

02:26.422 --> 02:27.601
It's tradition.

02:27.602 --> 02:30.768
So you're saying they'll be
too busy to come to our play?

02:30.769 --> 02:33.733
Well, no. We're in
the Canterlot pageant...

02:33.734 --> 02:36.705
...the biggest, most important
production in all of Equestria.

02:36.706 --> 02:39.354
A lot of ponies will come to watch us.

02:39.355 --> 02:40.481
A lot?

02:40.531 --> 02:41.679
Hundreds.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.930
Hundreds?

02:42.931 --> 02:44.873
Maybe even thousands!

02:49.316 --> 02:51.154
Oh! My hair!

02:51.155 --> 02:54.815
Applejack, be a dear and
shut those windows, will you?

02:56.052 --> 02:58.554
Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!

02:59.443 --> 03:02.081
Thank you! Thank you!

03:02.082 --> 03:04.892
It's a reenactment
of the founding of Equestria.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.171
It's not "The Rainbow Dash Show".

03:07.172 --> 03:11.071
Well, it should be "The Rainbow
Dash Show". I'm the star.

03:11.469 --> 03:14.204
Fluttershy! You've got to
come out of there!

03:14.205 --> 03:15.701
Curtain in two minutes.

03:15.702 --> 03:17.885
Twilight, let me handle this.

03:17.886 --> 03:18.773
My hair!

03:19.229 --> 03:21.434
PIIINKIEEE...

03:23.049 --> 03:26.638
The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant
is about harmony and friendship...

03:26.639 --> 03:28.874
SHUT THE WINDOW!

03:36.075 --> 03:39.868
Once upon a time, long before
the peaceful rule of Celestia...

03:39.869 --> 03:43.075
...and before ponies discovered
our beautiful land of Equestria...

03:43.076 --> 03:45.916
...ponies did not know harmony.

03:45.917 --> 03:48.614
It was a strange and dark time...

03:48.615 --> 03:50.765
...a time when ponies
were torn apart...

03:50.766 --> 03:51.947
...by hatred.

03:53.862 --> 03:55.907
I know. Can you believe it?

03:55.908 --> 03:58.966
During this frightful age
each of the three tribes...

03:58.967 --> 04:01.970
...the pegasi, the unicorns
and the earth ponies...

04:01.971 --> 04:07.522
...cared not for what befell the other
tribes, but only for their own welfare.

04:07.643 --> 04:10.038
In those troubled times, as now...

04:10.039 --> 04:12.526
...the pegasi were
the stewards of the weather...

04:13.074 --> 04:15.792
...but they demanded
something in return...

04:15.927 --> 04:19.585
...food that could only
be grown by the earth ponies.

04:26.313 --> 04:28.453
The unicorns demanded the same...

04:29.845 --> 04:33.816
...in return for magically
bringing forth day and night.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.261
And so mistrust between
the tribes festered...

04:37.262 --> 04:41.002
...until one fateful day
it came to a boil.

04:41.123 --> 04:43.414
And what prompted the ponies to clash?

04:43.732 --> 04:47.572
'Twas a mysterious blizzard,
that overtook the land...

04:47.573 --> 04:51.195
...and toppled the tribes'
precarious peace.

04:52.493 --> 04:56.624
The normally industrious earth ponies
were unable to farm their land.

05:04.035 --> 05:06.170
The earth ponies were freezing.

05:06.729 --> 05:09.002
Home of the pegasi fared no better.

05:10.884 --> 05:12.910
The pegasi were hungry.

05:14.595 --> 05:18.419
And the unicorns were
freezing *and* hungry.

05:20.017 --> 05:23.458
Even the unicorns' magic was
powerless against the storm.

05:27.784 --> 05:30.370
Each tribe blamed the others
for their suffering...

05:30.371 --> 05:34.526
...and the angrier everypony grew,
the worse the blizzard became.

05:36.313 --> 05:39.831
And so it was decided, that
a grand summit will be held...

05:39.832 --> 05:42.491
...to figure out a way
to cope with the blizzard.

05:42.492 --> 05:44.892
Each tribe sent their leaders.

05:46.256 --> 05:49.328
Daughter of the unicorn
king: Princess Platinum.

05:51.678 --> 05:55.228
Ruler of the pegasi:
Commander Hurricane.

05:55.229 --> 06:00.679
And lastly leader of the earth
ponies: Chancellor Puddinghead.

06:00.680 --> 06:04.393
Perhaps the three tribes could
finally settle their differences...

06:04.394 --> 06:08.059
...and agree on a way
to get through this disaster.

06:13.342 --> 06:17.038
All I wanna know is why the earth
ponies are hogging all the food.

06:18.374 --> 06:21.845
US?! We're not hogging
all the food. You are!

06:21.846 --> 06:23.628
Oh, wait. You're right. It's us.

06:23.629 --> 06:27.856
Well, it's only cause you mean old
pegasuseseses are making it snow like crazy!

06:27.857 --> 06:30.709
For the hundredth time, it's not us!

06:30.710 --> 06:32.347
We're not making it snow.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.428
It must be the unicorns!

06:34.429 --> 06:36.622
They're doing it with
their freaky magic.

06:37.609 --> 06:38.952
How dare you?!

06:38.953 --> 06:43.686
Unlike you pegasi ruffians, we unicorns
would never stoop to such a thing.

06:43.903 --> 06:44.887
Ha-Me-Ph.

06:44.888 --> 06:45.855
Hmph.

06:45.856 --> 06:49.200
Well, if you non-earths aren't gonna
stop using your weirdo powers...

06:49.201 --> 06:52.563
...to freeze us all, then
I'm just plum out of ideas.

06:52.564 --> 06:56.190
What a shocker!
An earth pony with no ideas.

06:56.191 --> 07:00.231
Commander Hurricane!
Please cease with the insults!

07:00.232 --> 07:02.936
You're not the boss of me,
your royal snootiness!

07:02.937 --> 07:04.706
I BEG YOUR PARDON!

07:04.707 --> 07:07.831
I am a princess!
I won't be spoken to that way!

07:08.108 --> 07:09.880
Well, I'm leaving first!

07:09.881 --> 07:11.831
No, I'm first!

07:16.198 --> 07:19.041
And the blizzard raged on.

07:22.938 --> 07:26.854
So the summit of the tribes did not
turn out as well as hoped...

07:26.855 --> 07:30.184
...and the three leaders returned
home to lick their wounds...

07:30.700 --> 07:33.105
...and basically complain.

07:36.885 --> 07:39.357
ATTEN-TION!

07:41.715 --> 07:44.325
Well? Aren't you curious
about how it went?

07:44.326 --> 07:47.703
Oh! Uh... Commander Hurricane, sir!
How did it go, sir?

07:47.704 --> 07:51.206
Horribly! Those other tribe
leaders are so disrespectful.

07:51.207 --> 07:53.909
Don't they realize that we are
a mighty tribe of warriors...

07:53.910 --> 07:55.294
...and should not be crossed?

07:55.295 --> 07:57.971
We have got to break ranks
with those weak foals.

08:02.070 --> 08:05.248
Clover the Clever! I need you!

08:05.625 --> 08:06.972
Yes, your majesty.

08:06.973 --> 08:09.579
Did the other pony tribes
see reason as I predicted?

08:09.580 --> 08:11.926
Those other tribes are impossible.

08:11.927 --> 08:16.641
I, for one, can no longer bear to be
anywhere near the lowly creatures.

08:16.642 --> 08:19.152
The unicorns are noble and majestic.

08:19.153 --> 08:22.293
We will no longer consort
with the likes of them.

08:29.661 --> 08:32.454
Wouldn't it have been easier
to use the door, Chancellor?

08:32.455 --> 08:36.352
Maybe for you, Smart Cookie.
But I am a chancellor.

08:36.353 --> 08:39.010
I was elected, because I know
how to think outside the box.

08:39.011 --> 08:40.049
Which means...

08:40.616 --> 08:43.498
...I can also think inside the chimney.

08:44.165 --> 08:46.390
Can you think inside the chimney?

08:46.391 --> 08:49.337
-I...
-I didn't think so.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.439
Oh my gosh. Hold on to your hooves...

08:54.440 --> 08:57.587
I am just about to be brilliant!

08:57.588 --> 08:58.766
That'd be a first.

08:58.767 --> 09:02.641
I have decided that the earth
ponies are gonna go it alone.

09:02.642 --> 09:05.381
Aw, so you mean the other
tribes didn't come around?

09:05.382 --> 09:08.010
Shoot. I really thought we could
get through to them if we...

09:08.011 --> 09:09.250
Don't worry about them.

09:09.251 --> 09:12.123
We're the ones with
all the food, right?

09:12.209 --> 09:14.423
Uh, actually we're all out.

09:14.823 --> 09:18.519
Fine. Then we'll have to go somewhere
near where we can grow some new food.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.410
And with me as our fearless
leader, what could go wrong?

09:23.645 --> 09:25.214
Where should I start?

09:25.946 --> 09:27.355
The point is...

09:27.723 --> 09:30.640
We must find a new land!

09:34.549 --> 09:36.892
Come on, Private Pansy.
Let's get a move on.

09:36.893 --> 09:38.479
Hup one, hup two...

09:40.368 --> 09:42.402
Get a hold of yourself, private!

09:42.403 --> 09:45.304
We cannot let anything distract us
from the mission at hand.

09:45.305 --> 09:49.422
To find (and if necessary
to conquer) a new land.

09:50.078 --> 09:51.556
Conquer, sir?

09:51.557 --> 09:54.319
Never know where enemies
might be lurking.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.389
I don't see any enemies, commander.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.332
Just snow.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.427
Aha! Who's that?

10:05.995 --> 10:08.257
Okay, this is getting old.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.540
Mm, this is simply taking forever.

10:13.541 --> 10:17.707
My hooves are killing me.
How long have we been walking for?

10:17.708 --> 10:19.791
About five minutes, Your Highness.

10:20.812 --> 10:24.108
I never imagined finding
a new land would be so hard.

10:24.109 --> 10:25.339
But it'll all be worth it.

10:25.340 --> 10:26.454
Don't you agree?

10:26.455 --> 10:29.670
I actually think that the three
tribes could have tried harder.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.684
STOOOP!

10:31.685 --> 10:34.726
-What's wrong?
-That is what's wrong.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.173
Your Highness, it's just a stream.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.742
We can cross it easily.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.874
I refuse to get my gown wet.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.819
I have no intention
of arriving at my new land...

10:46.820 --> 10:48.922
...looking like
a bedraggled earth pony.

10:48.923 --> 10:51.766
Or worse yet,
a rough-and-tumble pegasus.

10:51.767 --> 10:55.380
I, for one, have no intention
of stooping down to their level.

10:56.027 --> 10:59.743
On the other hand, I have no trouble
watching *you* stoop down.

11:02.559 --> 11:03.811
And do watch the gown, darling.

11:03.812 --> 11:06.617
It's worth more than all
of the books in your library.

11:11.898 --> 11:13.332
Yes, yes.

11:14.364 --> 11:16.858
This is definitely the right direction.

11:16.859 --> 11:18.593
It feels like we're going in circles.

11:18.594 --> 11:22.661
But that's impossible! Are you suggesting
that I'm reading the map wrong?

11:22.662 --> 11:24.511
Absolutely not, your chancellorness.

11:24.512 --> 11:27.448
It's just that there are
holes in the map and...

11:27.449 --> 11:30.707
Of course! How else could I
see where I was going!?

11:30.708 --> 11:32.266
Yeah, uh...

11:32.267 --> 11:34.602
Or talk? I need to be able to talk.

11:34.603 --> 11:38.063
I mean, how would we survive
if I just only shut up?

11:38.064 --> 11:41.002
Heaven forbid that should happen,
your chancellorship.

11:41.003 --> 11:44.388
It's just that the map
is also upside down.

11:44.389 --> 11:46.530
I got a news flash for you, Cookie.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.943
The earth is round.
There is no up or down.

11:48.944 --> 11:50.727
You're right!

11:50.728 --> 11:54.406
It's such a relief to me, that
you're in charge of this map.

11:54.407 --> 11:55.689
Relief?!

11:55.690 --> 11:58.744
You don't need relief! If anypony
needs relief around here, it's me!

11:58.745 --> 12:02.178
I'm a chancellor! I'm a big shot.
You're just my, uh...

12:02.250 --> 12:03.418
...my...

12:03.419 --> 12:04.441
Secretary.

12:04.442 --> 12:05.333
Whatever.

12:06.454 --> 12:10.373
You take the map, while
I enjoy some relief.

12:10.669 --> 12:12.616
Yes, chancellor Puddinghead.

12:14.626 --> 12:18.447
And so each leader encountered
obstacles along the way.

12:18.448 --> 12:23.595
But eventually they all arrived
in the new and wondrous land.

12:23.596 --> 12:27.178
Nopony ever seen paradise before.

12:27.768 --> 12:30.845
This is the new land
we've been searching for!

12:31.294 --> 12:34.905
What a view. I can see
my future house from here.

12:34.906 --> 12:37.271
I proclaim this new land to be...

12:38.449 --> 12:40.545
Pegasopolis!

12:40.844 --> 12:43.339
I've never seen such jewels.

12:43.340 --> 12:47.064
This ruby is dazzling.
This whole land is dazzling!

12:47.065 --> 12:49.033
I'm double-dazzled!

12:49.683 --> 12:54.828
In the name of the unicorns
I hereby dub this land Unicornia.

12:55.777 --> 12:57.951
The air! The trees!

12:59.094 --> 13:03.742
The dirt. This dirt is the dirtiest
dirt in the whole dirt world!

13:03.743 --> 13:06.096
And fertile too.
Perfect to grow on food.

13:06.097 --> 13:10.438
In the name of the earth ponies,
I think I'm gonna call this new place...

13:10.439 --> 13:11.531
Uh...

13:11.532 --> 13:13.098
Dirtville!

13:13.099 --> 13:14.954
How about Earth?

13:16.032 --> 13:16.934
Earth!

13:17.194 --> 13:20.587
Congratulations to me
for thinking of it.

13:22.455 --> 13:25.058
We've found our new home!

13:30.664 --> 13:32.586
I planted my flag first.

13:32.587 --> 13:34.618
-Did not!
-Did too!

13:34.619 --> 13:37.368
I planted mine earlier than first.

13:37.852 --> 13:40.395
All of you riffraff
are trespassing in Unicornia.

13:40.396 --> 13:42.578
The name is Pegasopolis.

13:42.579 --> 13:44.338
-Earth!
-Pegasopolis!

13:44.339 --> 13:45.958
Unicornia!

13:45.959 --> 13:47.768
I say we fight for the land.

13:47.769 --> 13:49.644
May the best pony win.

13:49.645 --> 13:51.093
That's barbaric.

13:51.094 --> 13:54.698
Clover the Clever, throw
that brute into the dungeon.

13:54.699 --> 13:59.373
What dungeon?! Look.
Perhaps if we all calm down...

13:59.374 --> 14:02.044
I agree. Let's all calm down.

14:02.272 --> 14:03.728
I vote for calm.

14:04.236 --> 14:07.628
I'll have you court-martialled
for insubordination, private!

14:07.629 --> 14:10.223
We settle this on the battlefield.

14:14.981 --> 14:18.500
Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?!

14:18.580 --> 14:22.284
Wait a minute. Where'd all this
snow come from anyway?

14:22.285 --> 14:24.316
Oh no. Not again.

14:32.470 --> 14:36.264
And so the paradise that the ponies
had found was soon lost...

14:36.265 --> 14:40.299
...buried beneath a thick blanket
of snow and hard feelings.

14:40.598 --> 14:43.774
Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy.

14:43.775 --> 14:46.345
Instead of wonderful, it was wintery.

14:46.346 --> 14:49.611
Instead of spectacular,
it was snowtacular!

14:49.612 --> 14:52.543
-Instead of...
-We get it! Move on!

14:54.258 --> 14:56.684
Everypony was forced to seek shelter.

14:56.685 --> 14:59.010
They searched high and low...

14:59.011 --> 15:03.602
...but the only shelter for miles
was a cold and desolate cave.

15:04.169 --> 15:07.794
And, of course, the three
tribes had to share it.

15:07.795 --> 15:11.159
And nopony was too happy about that.

15:11.894 --> 15:13.864
Please, Commander Hothead...

15:13.865 --> 15:16.007
It's Commander Hurricane!

15:17.128 --> 15:21.941
Please, Commander, could you just
stand back and give me my royal space?

15:21.942 --> 15:24.192
You mean like this, Your Highness?

15:24.193 --> 15:25.394
Indeed not.

15:25.395 --> 15:27.818
You see this invisible line?

15:27.819 --> 15:31.947
Private, outline our territory
for everypony to see.

15:34.047 --> 15:36.405
See this real, non-invisible line?

15:36.406 --> 15:40.180
No unicorns or earth ponies
are allowed to cross it.

15:40.181 --> 15:43.494
This is the sovereign
territory of Pegasopolis.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.711
-Clover the Clever!
-Smart Cookie!

15:46.712 --> 15:48.264
I know, I know.

15:56.336 --> 15:57.418
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

15:57.419 --> 15:59.200
Don't go around the rock. Go over it.

15:59.201 --> 16:01.626
I'm not giving up an inch
of territory to the enemy.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.734
That rock is clearly on the Unicornia's
side of the cave and it belongs to us.

16:05.735 --> 16:08.296
Who knows? There could be jewels inside.

16:09.256 --> 16:12.093
I claim this rock for Pegasopolis.

16:12.094 --> 16:15.500
Unhand that rock this
instant, you scoundrel!

16:15.793 --> 16:19.201
Oh, lookie, found my rock.
I've been looking for it everywhere.

16:21.093 --> 16:21.924
Hey!

16:21.925 --> 16:23.515
You invaded our territory!

16:23.516 --> 16:25.722
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.858
That's the last straw!

16:30.718 --> 16:32.281
Give me my rock!

16:45.169 --> 16:47.799
Look, everypony! The entrance!

16:51.057 --> 16:54.957
Great. Now there's
no way out. We're trapped.

16:54.958 --> 16:57.192
You two deserve this horrible fate.

16:57.193 --> 16:59.748
You've done nothing but argue
and fight with each other.

16:59.749 --> 17:02.086
You've been fighting too,
"Your Highness".

17:02.087 --> 17:03.436
Yeah! Worse!

17:03.437 --> 17:06.114
I haven't been fighting
nearly as much as you!

17:06.115 --> 17:07.525
How ridiculous!

17:07.526 --> 17:09.404
A unicorn never stoops to fighting.

17:09.405 --> 17:12.732
That's just cause you wimpy
unicorns know you never win.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.282
Earth ponies are numbskul...!

17:15.394 --> 17:17.070
Pegasi are brut...!

17:17.287 --> 17:19.131
Unicorns are snob...!

17:36.384 --> 17:38.572
What is that thing?

17:38.573 --> 17:41.389
They must be... windigos.

17:41.390 --> 17:43.328
Windigos?

17:43.658 --> 17:46.585
My mentor, Star Swirl the Bearded,
taught me about them.

17:46.586 --> 17:49.785
They're winter spirits that feed
on fighting and hatred.

17:49.786 --> 17:53.923
The more hate the spirit feels,
the colder things become.

17:53.924 --> 17:56.231
Then this is our fault.

17:56.423 --> 18:00.136
We, three tribes. We brought
this blizzard to our home...

18:00.137 --> 18:02.754
...by fightin' and
not trustin' each other.

18:02.755 --> 18:05.011
Now it's destroyin' this land too.

18:05.782 --> 18:08.878
And now our bodies will
become as cold as our hearts.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.892
All because we were
foolish enough to hate.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.222
Well, I don't hate you.

18:15.223 --> 18:19.501
I actually hate Commander Hurricane
a lot more than I hate you guys.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.772
Actually, I don't really hate her.

18:25.773 --> 18:27.809
I just really, really,
really, really, really...

18:27.810 --> 18:31.128
...really, really, really,
really, really dislike her.

18:34.247 --> 18:37.531
-Well, I don't hate you guys either.
-Nor do I.

18:39.791 --> 18:43.144
No matter what our differences,
we're all ponies.

19:04.094 --> 19:05.125
What was that?!

19:05.126 --> 19:07.142
I didn't know unicorns could do that.

19:07.143 --> 19:08.250
I didn't either.

19:08.251 --> 19:10.381
Nothing like this has
ever happened before.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.826
But I know it couldn't
have been just me.

19:12.827 --> 19:17.155
It came from all three of us
join together in friendship.

19:17.917 --> 19:21.389
All through the night the three ponies
kept the fire of friendship alive...

19:21.390 --> 19:24.637
...by telling stories to one another
and by singing songs...

19:24.638 --> 19:29.466
...which of course became the winter
carols that we all still sing today.

19:29.467 --> 19:33.481
Eventually the warmth of the
fire and singing and laughing...

19:33.482 --> 19:37.360
...reached the leaders and
their bodies began to thaw.

19:38.346 --> 19:41.844
And it even began to melt their hearts.

19:54.900 --> 19:58.184
The three leaders agreed to
share the beautiful land...

19:58.185 --> 20:00.956
...and with it harmony,
ever afterwards...

20:00.957 --> 20:03.948
...and together they
named their new land...

20:03.949 --> 20:05.851
Equestria!

20:20.038 --> 20:24.031
<i>The fire of friendship
lives in our hearts</i>

20:24.032 --> 20:28.284
<i>As long as it burns,
we cannot drift apart</i>

20:28.285 --> 20:32.435
<i>Though quarrels arise,
their numbers are few</i>

20:32.436 --> 20:38.189
<i>Laughter and singing will see us through
(Will see us through)</i>

20:38.190 --> 20:42.026
<i>We are a circle of pony friends</i>

20:42.027 --> 20:50.751
<i>A circle of friends
we'll be to the very end</i>

20:55.987 --> 20:59.544
We should be so honored that
Princess Celestia chose us.

20:59.545 --> 21:03.749
She must really think we exemplify
what good friends are.

21:05.185 --> 21:08.198
Applejack, I thought you
closed all the windows.

21:08.199 --> 21:09.443
Don't blame me.

21:09.444 --> 21:12.843
Rainbow Dash should have flown up there
and shut it. After all, she's got wings.

21:12.844 --> 21:15.407
Why do I always have to do
all the high-up chores?

21:15.408 --> 21:18.014
Why can't Twilight use
her magic for a change?

21:22.818 --> 21:25.056
You know what? I've got it.

21:32.919 --> 21:36.419
