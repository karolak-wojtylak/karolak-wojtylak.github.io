WEBVTT

00:20.087 --> 00:21.620
Oooo, be careful!

00:43.310 --> 00:44.777
Oh!

00:44.779 --> 00:46.512
Are you OK, Angel?

00:52.753 --> 00:55.487
I told you that entering the
Ponyville Paw-Kour contest

00:55.489 --> 00:57.823
was a dangerous idea.

00:57.825 --> 01:01.693
You just rest here and I'll have
you all fixed up in no time.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.196
♪♪

01:04.198 --> 01:08.067
Oh, dear. I'm all out
of bunny foot braces.

01:08.069 --> 01:11.470
I think we need to pay
a visit to Dr. Fauna.

01:26.353 --> 01:29.421
I was sure that she
would be here today.

01:29.423 --> 01:33.525
Hello? Is anypony there?

01:33.527 --> 01:37.262
Fluttershy? Oh, am
I glad to see you!

01:40.133 --> 01:42.701
I wish I could say the same,
but the door is stuck so,

01:42.703 --> 01:44.536
I um... can't see you.

01:49.242 --> 01:52.578
Ooh. Somebunny hurt his foot!

01:52.580 --> 01:55.581
Let's bandage that up
so he can get back home.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.350
I'd like to keep him overnight,
but as you can see

01:58.352 --> 02:01.720
my place is just
bursting with animals.

02:01.722 --> 02:05.190
I don't think I can take in even
one more critter right now.

02:10.498 --> 02:11.830
Both: Oh, dear.

03:09.622 --> 03:12.224
You really have your
hooves full here.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.226
This place is like a zoo!

03:16.629 --> 03:19.531
Then again, it's normally
like that but still...

03:19.533 --> 03:20.732
I can't keep up!

03:27.941 --> 03:32.911
Now does my favorite wittle
bunny want a carrot-pop?

03:36.916 --> 03:39.952
That's OK. I think the goats
ate all of them, anyway.

03:43.256 --> 03:45.924
I just can't believe all these
poor little animals are hurt!

03:45.926 --> 03:47.693
What happened?

03:47.695 --> 03:48.793
I'm flummoxed!

03:48.795 --> 03:52.664
Every day, there's more and
more animals on my doorstep.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.633
Most of them just
have minor ailments:

03:54.635 --> 03:57.102
hurt wings, stuffy
noses and such.

03:57.104 --> 04:00.639
But the trouble is, even
after they're all healed up,

04:02.175 --> 04:05.577
I can't seem to get these
comfy critters to leave!

04:05.779 --> 04:07.379
Oh, dear!

04:12.652 --> 04:15.587
They do seem to have made
themselves right at home here.

04:17.323 --> 04:20.892
I wonder why they chose
to flock to my office.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.695
It just doesn't
make sense.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.931
Don't be silly, Dr. Fauna.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.533
You're the best Vet
Pony in Equestria!

04:28.535 --> 04:31.370
At least that's what I've
been telling everypony.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.005
Ah, you did what?

04:35.742 --> 04:40.679
Oh, no! Do you suppose it's
my fault? I'm so sorry;

04:40.681 --> 04:42.648
I didn't mean for
this to happen.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.851
I just know animals feel safe
and happy under your care.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.724
Normally, I don't mind if a
snake wants to slither in

04:52.726 --> 04:56.361
or a raccoon needs a rest. But
now this place is so full,

04:56.363 --> 04:59.498
I have no space to treat
any injured animals!

04:59.500 --> 05:03.068
That is a big problem.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.971
That I'm going to
fix for you!

05:05.973 --> 05:07.906
I already have the
perfect solution

05:07.908 --> 05:11.810
that'll make the critters
happy and give you more space!

05:11.812 --> 05:14.346
Then you'll have all
your ducks in a row.

05:20.453 --> 05:21.953
The sooner you fix
it, the better!

05:23.723 --> 05:24.923
I'm on it.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.962
I want to thank you all

05:30.964 --> 05:32.864
for rushing right
over when I called.

05:36.637 --> 05:40.539
Dr. Fauna needs my help
with a serious problem.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.939
A friendship problem?

05:41.941 --> 05:46.912
No. Her vet clinic is a
bit maybe um... overrun

05:46.914 --> 05:50.515
with adorable critters in
dire need of a safe place

05:50.517 --> 05:52.851
to lay their heads and...

05:52.853 --> 05:56.488
... they don't have
anywhere to go!

05:56.490 --> 05:58.890
Oh, that's just awful.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.525
I know!

06:00.527 --> 06:03.762
Yeah, Dr. Fauna's
always fixin' Winona up

06:03.764 --> 06:05.263
when she ain't
feelin' too fine,

06:05.265 --> 06:07.832
so helpin' her out
is A-OK by me.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.067
Yeah!

06:11.404 --> 06:15.273
That's great news because it
means you'll all be helping me

06:15.275 --> 06:17.342
with something special, too.

06:17.344 --> 06:21.346
Something that's been a dream
of mine for a long time.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.515
Oh, goody! Is your dream
to make a bouncy castle

06:23.517 --> 06:25.884
shaped like a
gigantic bundt cake?

06:25.886 --> 06:28.887
Um, no...
not exactly.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.922
Oh, just me then.

06:30.924 --> 06:34.025
So what is it,
Fluttershy? Spill!

06:34.027 --> 06:38.496
My dream is to build a
real animal sanctuary.

06:38.498 --> 06:42.967
A beautiful habitat where every
animal, whether sick...

06:42.969 --> 06:44.235
or scared...

06:44.237 --> 06:46.571
or even just lonely.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.074
Feathered or furry,
scaly or slimy,

06:50.076 --> 06:52.977
every critter would be welcome.

06:52.979 --> 06:56.014
My sanctuary can be the
one place in Equestria

06:56.016 --> 07:00.084
they call home till they feel
ready to take on the world.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.489
Wow, Fluttershy.

07:04.491 --> 07:06.491
I've never heard you speak
with such conviction.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.194
That was exquisite!

07:09.396 --> 07:11.796
Pretty awesome.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.998
Thank you, everypony.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.835
You've all taught me so much
about building my confidence

07:16.837 --> 07:20.071
over the years. It's
because of your friendship

07:20.073 --> 07:24.442
that I finally feel able to make
my dream project a reality.

07:24.444 --> 07:29.180
But I can't build the sanctuary
alone. Will you join me?

07:29.182 --> 07:31.049
Of course! Yeah!

07:31.051 --> 07:34.452
I'm happy to offer my
extra hooves to ya!

07:34.454 --> 07:37.555
But come to think of it,
I actually know a filly

07:37.557 --> 07:40.191
who'd be more help than I
would. She's a friend of mine

07:40.193 --> 07:43.294
from Winona's sheep herdin'
competition: Wrangler.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.430
She's an expert in
animal enclosures.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.031
How lovely!

07:47.033 --> 07:49.434
Ooo! Ooo! Ooo! I
know somepony, too!

07:49.436 --> 07:52.537
Hard Hat is the best
construction pony in Ponyville.

07:52.539 --> 07:56.074
He can build anything you
could ever, ever, ever want!

07:56.076 --> 07:58.243
Hearing you all
mention these experts,

07:58.245 --> 08:01.212
I am reminded that I,
too, have the perfect pony

08:01.214 --> 08:03.481
to help capture the
essence of your vision.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.985
To give it some
style, some flair!

08:06.587 --> 08:07.985
Is it you, Rarity?

08:07.987 --> 08:13.792
No, no. Um I was referring to
the premiere interior designer

08:13.794 --> 08:17.829
of the Canterlot
Elite: Dandy Grandeur.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.066
He helped me when I was setting
up my Canterlot boutique.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.768
I know he'd be thrilled
to work with you!

08:23.770 --> 08:26.505
Wow, everypony!
Thank you.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.975
I can't wait to meet all of
them and hear their ideas.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.710
We're right on
track to building

08:31.712 --> 08:34.913
the most wonderful
sanctuary in Equestria.

08:47.261 --> 08:48.693
Thank you,
Rupert!

08:52.532 --> 08:55.767
Ahem. It's wonderful that
you all could join me

08:55.769 --> 08:58.803
to discuss the Ponyville
sanctuary project.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.972
My friends have so
many nice things to say

09:00.974 --> 09:03.074
about each of your talents!

09:03.076 --> 09:05.844
This is a big project,
so I'm happy to have

09:05.846 --> 09:08.747
such experienced ponies
working on it with me.

09:08.749 --> 09:12.784
Rarity has impeccable taste
in design and friends.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.620
So I can't wait to work
with you, you know?

09:15.622 --> 09:17.622
I--I think so.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.090
Yee-haw!

09:19.092 --> 09:21.259
I'm just lookin' forward
to helpin' ya out, ma'am.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.727
And the animals.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.827
Of course.

09:23.829 --> 09:27.699
So, uh... Pinkie Pie said
you drew up some blueprints?

09:27.701 --> 09:31.002
Um, Not exactly; it's
more of a "dream-board."

09:40.347 --> 09:42.847
That sure doesn't look
like an animal hospital.

09:42.849 --> 09:46.084
That's because it's
not. It's a sanctuary.

09:46.086 --> 09:50.655
A place that is safe but not
restrictive, cozy but natural.

09:50.657 --> 09:53.358
A place where the animals can
come and go as they please.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.333
So... can you build it?

10:13.212 --> 10:17.115
I want the sanctuary to
have an open floor plan.

10:17.117 --> 10:21.386
No walls, more like an enclosure
that melts into the trees,

10:21.388 --> 10:22.686
with a gate in the back.

10:22.688 --> 10:25.223
That way, the animals
can return to the forest

10:25.225 --> 10:27.292
right when they feel ready.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.261
Sneaky! I like it.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.098
You know, I designed
the Ponyville Hospital.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.367
I could do the exact
same thing right here.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.702
I still have the blueprints.

10:37.704 --> 10:41.339
Though it'll take a while
to clear all these trees.

10:41.341 --> 10:45.810
But I don't want to clear the
trees. I want to use them.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.345
Are you sure?

10:47.347 --> 10:48.945
What you're talking about
doesn't really seem

10:48.947 --> 10:53.084
like a cohesive structure. Or
any structure I'm familiar with.

10:53.086 --> 10:56.821
Critters don't live
the same way ponies do.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.691
I know this is unconventional,
but that's because

10:59.693 --> 11:03.161
we're trying to do something
that's never been done before.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.929
And I really believe
it'll work.

11:10.970 --> 11:15.140
All right, then. I'll
see what I can do.

11:15.142 --> 11:18.443
See, Fluttershy?
Whatever you want!

11:18.845 --> 11:19.778
Good.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.948
I know she thinks
knows what's best,

11:23.950 --> 11:25.784
but once she sees how
much better it works

11:25.786 --> 11:27.886
with these plans,
she'll thank us.

11:34.727 --> 11:37.362
Which one do you like for
the window treatments?

11:37.364 --> 11:40.732
Loving the print
on those!

11:40.734 --> 11:44.769
Um... not to be rude, but
there must be some mistake.

11:44.771 --> 11:47.305
We have no need for
curtains at the sanctuary.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.340
And why ever not?

11:49.342 --> 11:52.444
Everything is going to look
natural in the animal habitats,

11:52.446 --> 11:54.913
not like it was
made for ponies.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.048
All those shades
of brown and green?

11:57.050 --> 12:01.252
But... they're so
drab. You know?

12:01.254 --> 12:03.221
Ha ha ha ha!

12:03.223 --> 12:08.393
Drab? You're calling the colors
of beautiful trees drab?

12:08.395 --> 12:12.230
Exactly! The "natural"
look is not in right now.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.032
This is better, trust me.

12:16.068 --> 12:19.370
I appreciate your input,
but I just know the animals

12:19.372 --> 12:21.339
would be happiest with
dirt brown pillows

12:21.341 --> 12:23.408
and leaf green accents.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.411
I'll look into it.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.846
Thank you.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.048
When a client has a vision!

12:31.384 --> 12:36.755
Sometimes they need me to
steer them away from it.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.357
Especially if its dirt brown.

12:41.861 --> 12:44.996
And right there we got yer
standard sheep travelin' cage.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.098
Fits two critters,
dependin' on size.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.134
Hmmm.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.069
What is it, sugarcube?

12:51.071 --> 12:54.139
I'm looking for something
less like a cage...

12:54.141 --> 12:58.977
more like a nice hug. Maybe
if we lose that part...

12:58.979 --> 13:01.980
Well, then it
wouldn't be a cage.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.382
Exactly! Ooh!

13:04.384 --> 13:07.552
This is the perfect
base for a little nest.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.852
I'll take a bunch of these.

13:08.854 --> 13:12.056
And anything else the
animals can burrow into.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.758
You sure you don't
want something

13:13.760 --> 13:15.326
more secure for
the critters?

13:15.328 --> 13:17.028
She does have a
point there.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.196
You wouldn't want
a bunny wandering

13:18.198 --> 13:19.396
into the wrong
cave, would ya?

13:20.098 --> 13:24.169
No! No cages. I want to
give the animals the freedom

13:24.171 --> 13:28.273
to come and go. It's the only
way they'll feel comfortable.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.074
Well, she's the boss!

13:43.389 --> 13:46.391
Hey! What do you
think, Fluttershy?

13:46.393 --> 13:47.992
I told you we'd be fast!

13:47.994 --> 13:50.195
Almost finished with
the building already!

13:50.197 --> 13:52.997
The color just pops,
you know?

13:52.999 --> 13:56.968
Quite roomy inside,
really. And very safe!

13:56.970 --> 13:59.103
Don't keep us
waiting, Fluttershy!

13:59.105 --> 14:02.540
Do you love it or
do you love it?

14:02.542 --> 14:06.144
I.. I...

14:06.146 --> 14:10.615
I don't love it. This is
not going to work at all!

14:10.617 --> 14:13.218
A giraffe can't fit
through this door.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.053
With these curtains
blocking the light,

14:15.055 --> 14:17.889
how are the birds going
to sing in the sunshine?

14:17.891 --> 14:21.526
And this is the
opposite of a nice hug!

14:21.528 --> 14:23.528
I know you all
worked hard,

14:23.530 --> 14:26.531
but none of you did
anything I asked for.

14:28.334 --> 14:32.537
That's not true! We used the
trees just like you asked.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.106
And that curtain
fabric is organic!

14:35.108 --> 14:37.308
It's got
"natural" fibers.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.011
And I added pillows
inside my cages!

14:40.013 --> 14:42.380
That should count as
feelin' like a hug.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.149
I may not know much
about construction,

14:45.151 --> 14:48.119
or interior design,
or wrangling...

14:48.121 --> 14:53.491
but I am an expert at one
thing: the care of animals.

14:53.493 --> 14:58.930
And what animals need is
a sanctuary, not this!

14:58.932 --> 15:03.668
Maybe your vision wasn't all it
was cracked up to be, you know?

15:03.670 --> 15:06.271
My vision isn't
the problem here.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.173
I told you all
exactly what I wanted

15:09.175 --> 15:11.542
and none of you
listened to me!

15:11.544 --> 15:13.645
So while I appreciate
your efforts,

15:13.647 --> 15:16.414
I no longer require
your services.

15:22.122 --> 15:26.691
Hello! The animals have been
so excited for the sanctuary,

15:26.693 --> 15:30.695
they couldn't wait any longer.
Can we take a look inside?

15:30.697 --> 15:34.699
Oh, um actually,
it's uh, not ready and--

15:53.552 --> 15:55.053
Oh, no! Ahhh!

16:08.468 --> 16:11.002
Oh, I'm so sorry,
Fluttershy.

16:11.004 --> 16:14.238
No, I'm the one who
should be sorry.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.507
This didn't go at all
like I had imagined.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.352
Sleep tight, little one.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.188
It's going to be
OK, I promise.

16:32.058 --> 16:35.126
Now, now. Everymouse has
got to wait their turn.

16:38.163 --> 16:42.533
I'm so sorry. I thought I'd
have a beautiful sanctuary

16:42.535 --> 16:44.669
for you all to stay
in by now,

16:44.671 --> 16:47.605
but I put my trust
in the wrong ponies.

16:47.607 --> 16:51.476
It's OK, Fluttershy, I
know you did your best.

16:51.478 --> 16:57.115
But we can make this work
here. It'll be a bit... tight,

16:57.117 --> 16:58.015
but with your help,

16:58.017 --> 17:01.586
we'll have these patients back
on their paws in no time.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.389
Even without a sanctuary.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.591
No!

17:06.593 --> 17:09.761
I won't give up!
These animals need me

17:09.763 --> 17:13.031
and I'm going to solve
this once and for all.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.299
If this little lady can
crawl all the way here

17:15.301 --> 17:18.269
from Western Equestria, I
can find a way to build her

17:18.271 --> 17:20.438
a safe place to rest!

17:28.181 --> 17:32.083
Oops, everyone
back to sleep now.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.752
Thanks for coming,
everypony. As you know,

17:34.754 --> 17:37.789
building the sanctuary
didn't go quite as planned.

17:37.791 --> 17:39.624
I know, right? Who'd
have guessed

17:39.626 --> 17:42.326
that Hard Hat wouldn't
build whatever you want?

17:42.328 --> 17:44.295
I never would have
invited Dandy to help

17:44.297 --> 17:46.831
if I thought he'd
act in such a manner.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.534
And Wrangler sure made
a fool outta me, too.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.369
I'm sorry, Fluttershy.

17:51.371 --> 17:54.639
It's OK. You were all
just trying to help.

17:54.641 --> 17:58.376
But I know that letting all the
experts go was the right call.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.211
So what are you going
to do now?

18:00.213 --> 18:01.646
Try again.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.182
I'm going to re-build
the sanctuary...

18:04.184 --> 18:06.217
and do it my way this time.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.153
Awesome!
That's the spirit!
You show 'em!

18:09.855 --> 18:11.556
How about putting an
awesome flying course

18:11.558 --> 18:13.157
for the birds right there?

18:13.159 --> 18:15.126
And a carrot-cake
stand here!

18:15.128 --> 18:16.627
A library cave?

18:16.629 --> 18:18.329
Everypony, STOP!

18:20.466 --> 18:22.667
I appreciate you
sharing your thoughts,

18:22.669 --> 18:25.736
but I need everypony
to respect mine.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.473
Other ponies may be
experts in their fields,

18:28.475 --> 18:31.642
but animals are my
field of expertise.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.378
And if I say this
is what I want...

18:34.380 --> 18:38.249
Then this is what
needs to happen!

18:38.251 --> 18:40.818
For the animals,
of course.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.122
Wow, we should call
you Flutterbold now!

18:47.127 --> 18:49.827
To get things back on
track, I called in a favor

18:49.829 --> 18:52.563
from an old friend.
He'll be here any minute.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.733
I thought you said
no more "experts."

18:55.735 --> 18:59.437
This is one expert I know I can
trust to put the animals first.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.606
Plus there's nopony
better at building.

19:04.810 --> 19:09.180
Heh heh. I heard somepony
needs construction help

19:09.182 --> 19:10.882
for them critters.

19:10.884 --> 19:12.383
Big Daddy McColt!

19:14.353 --> 19:16.521
We met each other back when the
map called me and Fluttershy

19:16.523 --> 19:18.523
to the Smokey Mountains!

19:18.525 --> 19:21.392
And he certainly knows his stuff
when it comes to buildings

19:21.394 --> 19:23.594
and caring for animals.

19:23.596 --> 19:28.199
Well, shucks, let's not stand
around talkin' about it.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.568
Let's build us
a sanctuary!

20:22.955 --> 20:24.054
Are you ready?

20:24.056 --> 20:28.626
Oh, I'm more excited than
a beaver in a log pile!

20:28.728 --> 20:32.230
OK. You can open your eyes!

20:32.232 --> 20:35.466
Welcome to Sweetfeather
Sanctuary!

20:35.468 --> 20:38.970
A safe and cozy retreat
for every creature.

20:49.782 --> 20:54.252
Oh, Fluttershy.
This is amazing!

20:54.254 --> 20:56.654
Now you should have plenty
of room at the clinic

20:56.656 --> 20:59.690
because once you've treated
them, they can recover here!

20:59.692 --> 21:01.525
With my help, of course.

21:04.563 --> 21:07.865
It's OK, Lola. We all
move at our own pace.

21:10.937 --> 21:15.439
Sometimes all we need to do
is believe in our dreams!

21:15.441 --> 21:17.708
And when we finally
reach our goal...

21:17.710 --> 21:21.012
... we'll know that it was worth
what it took to get there.

21:21.014 --> 21:25.650
Because the view will be even
better than you imagined.
