WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:05.839
Starswirl: The best elements
within us can spread light

00:05.941 --> 00:09.709
and virtue and I know ponies
who represent them all:

00:10.211 --> 00:17.083
strength, bravery, healing,
beauty, hope and sorcery.

00:17.885 --> 00:21.687
Myself and these Pillars of
Equestria were gathered together

00:21.789 --> 00:24.924
by another to maintain
and share the light

00:25.026 --> 00:27.260
of these powerful ideals.

00:27.562 --> 00:31.564
But we soon came to believe the
pony who brought us together,

00:31.766 --> 00:34.468
only wanted that
power for himself.

00:35.770 --> 00:39.138
Cast out and alone,
this power-mad pony

00:39.240 --> 00:43.275
turned to darkness to
satisfy his thirst.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.045
Transformed into
a Pony of Shadows,

00:46.147 --> 00:50.583
he returned for revenge, to
extinguish the Pillars' light

00:50.785 --> 00:53.253
and rob the world of hope.

00:53.555 --> 00:58.124
To stop him, the Pillars and I
must make a grave sacrifice.

00:58.926 --> 01:03.129
But we shall leave behind a
seed in hopes that one day

01:03.231 --> 01:07.166
it will grow into a force to
stand against the darkness

01:07.268 --> 01:08.468
for all time.

01:08.770 --> 01:14.240
We must now face the fiend
with the only plan we have.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.043
"I only hope it will be enough."

01:17.845 --> 01:19.178
That's the last entry.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.882
And maybe Starswirl's final
words before he vanished!

02:02.455 --> 02:05.257
I've always wondered
what happened to Starswirl.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.627
This is quite a
discovery, Sunburst.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.596
So it's genuine?

02:10.698 --> 02:12.998
You can verify that this
journal really belonged

02:13.100 --> 02:14.499
to Starswirl the Bearded!?

02:14.801 --> 02:15.667
Indeed.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.536
From the looks of it,
the last thing he wrote

02:17.638 --> 02:19.839
before facing the
Pony of Shadows.

02:20.741 --> 02:25.177
Uh, so, the Pony of
Shadows was really real?

02:25.679 --> 02:27.046
It appears so.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.015
We never met the other
Pillars and we were too young

02:30.117 --> 02:32.184
to understand the
danger they faced.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.719
Hold on a second now!

02:33.921 --> 02:36.688
All those legendary
ponies were real too?

02:36.790 --> 02:39.891
And they went off with Starswirl
to face the Pony of Shadows

02:39.993 --> 02:42.794
and then none of them were
ever heard from again?

02:43.196 --> 02:45.798
Ah-ha, yeah. Weren't
you listening?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.467
But what happened
to them all?

02:48.569 --> 02:50.035
They must have
defeated the villain,

02:50.137 --> 02:52.504
since Equestria's still
full of light and hope.

02:52.806 --> 02:55.140
But how? And where
did they go?

02:55.442 --> 02:57.543
My Olde Ponish
is a bit rusty,

02:57.845 --> 03:00.245
but I wonder if the answers
can be found somewhere

03:00.347 --> 03:02.247
within the pages
of this book.

03:02.649 --> 03:06.117
Well, I just happen to be
an expert in Olde Ponish.

03:06.219 --> 03:08.820
I mean, I've practically
memorized every ancient text

03:08.922 --> 03:10.655
about Starswirl there is.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.725
Seriously. All
of them.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.627
We have fond memories
of our old teacher.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.662
If you could discover
what happened to him,

03:17.864 --> 03:19.397
we would be most grateful.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.835
Solving a thousands-year-old
mystery could take forever!

03:24.037 --> 03:28.907
Think of the research, the
re-reading, the re-re-reading.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.812
You might find
you need help.

03:33.614 --> 03:37.115
Luckily, she's got a whole
bushel of helpers right here.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.150
Totally!

03:38.452 --> 03:42.654
Uh, how long will all this
research take, exactly?

03:43.156 --> 03:44.856
Let's get this
back to my library.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.325
I'm sure we'll figure out
what happened in no time.

03:55.801 --> 03:57.535
Figure it out yet, Twilight?

04:00.239 --> 04:01.073
Wha-WHAT?

04:01.575 --> 04:02.774
What did you figure out?

04:03.176 --> 04:04.476
[gasp] You figured something out!?

04:05.979 --> 04:06.879
What is it?

04:07.381 --> 04:08.480
[sigh] Nothing.

04:08.682 --> 04:11.583
I mean, Starswirl was
a genius, obviously,

04:11.785 --> 04:13.151
but forget Olde Ponish.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.686
There's parts where
his hornwriting

04:14.788 --> 04:16.321
is like another language!

04:16.523 --> 04:17.322
Agh!

04:17.724 --> 04:21.693
[groan] Twilight, we've been
studyin' and referencin'

04:21.795 --> 04:25.764
and cross referencing for
three days straight now.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.800
Ugh. I haven't spent
this much time reading

04:28.902 --> 04:31.403
since the last Daring
Do book came out.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.472
Perhaps it is time
to take a break.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.508
This mystery is over a
thousand years old, after all.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.944
Another day or two
won't make a difference!

04:39.346 --> 04:40.479
Two days!?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.046
I don't want to
waste two seconds.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.316
I'm close to an answer.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.251
I can feel it.

04:46.453 --> 04:51.056
"Hearg sylfum se
Ponhenge," What's that?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.191
The Temple of Ponhenge?

04:53.393 --> 04:54.493
You can read that!?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.528
The hornwriting's
pretty sloppy,

04:56.630 --> 04:58.464
but it's nowhere
near as bad as mine.

04:58.966 --> 05:03.636
"Toward dol grimlic
of fola firgenbeorg?"

05:04.538 --> 05:07.239
At the base of Foal Mountain...

05:07.841 --> 05:10.041
"User endemest scield... "

05:10.343 --> 05:12.710
[gasp] Our last stand.

05:12.956 --> 05:14.356
Spike: [yawn]

05:15.081 --> 05:18.650
Well, that sure sounds
like a clue to me.

05:29.863 --> 05:30.662
This is it.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.663
Ponhenge.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.531
I can't believe it.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.739
I've never seen magical
runes like these before.

05:40.941 --> 05:41.673
Have you?

05:41.975 --> 05:42.574
Uh uh.

05:45.011 --> 05:50.014
I don't think anypony's seen
any of this for a long time.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.251
[struggle] Woah!

05:54.387 --> 05:57.522
It'd take a whole team of ponies
to clear away all this brush.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.893
Even then, I'm not
sure we'd find out

06:01.995 --> 06:04.430
what happened here a
thousand years ago.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.099
[sigh] You're right.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.468
I suppose it was a long shot.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.736
Cheer up, Twilight.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.372
Finding a whole set of ancient
ruins is pretty impressive.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.008
Maybe you could
write a paper on it!

06:16.510 --> 06:18.910
I guess I hoped we'd get here
and the mystery would just

06:19.012 --> 06:20.611
magically be explained.

06:23.615 --> 06:25.049
Uh, Twilight?

06:33.626 --> 06:34.559
Starswirl..?

06:34.961 --> 06:37.162
I-- I've wanted to
meet you my whole life!

06:37.364 --> 06:39.130
I can't believe
you're here!

06:42.402 --> 06:43.902
I don't think
he is here.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.304
I don't think any
of them are.

07:02.022 --> 07:05.224
You summon me at your
peril, Starswirl.

07:05.526 --> 07:09.928
Once I defeat all of you, this
realm will embrace the darkness

07:10.130 --> 07:12.363
as I did so long ago.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.745
Drawing me here will
only make me stronger.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.247
You will never defeat me!

07:29.349 --> 07:31.950
We did not come
here to defeat you.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.063
What are you doing?

07:45.665 --> 07:48.366
We came to contain you.

07:50.202 --> 07:52.904
Aaaaahhh!

08:03.749 --> 08:06.784
Well, you did ask for
a magical explanation!

08:12.993 --> 08:15.661
Uh, what just happened?

08:16.363 --> 08:18.797
It looked like
Starswirl cast a spell

08:18.899 --> 08:20.899
that banished the
Pony of Shadows.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.869
Of course! Powerful
magic like that

08:23.971 --> 08:25.771
would leave an impression
on this place.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.040
Bringing the book back here
let us see what happened.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.476
Which was what?

08:30.978 --> 08:33.879
Starswirl and the rest of the
Pillars sacrificed themselves

08:33.981 --> 08:35.447
to save Equestria.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.652
It's amazing to think one of the
greatest mysteries of Equestria

08:40.754 --> 08:43.489
was solved with a musty old
book from an antique shop.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.124
But I wouldn't say
the mystery's solved.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.060
Starswirl's spell was one of the
most powerful feats of magic

08:49.162 --> 08:50.629
in all of history.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.932
It'll take years of study
before we fully understand it.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.401
I think I understand
Starswirl's spell!

08:58.771 --> 09:01.139
I know I've finished one of
Starswirl's spells before

09:01.341 --> 09:03.708
but this one was on a
whole different level!

09:03.810 --> 09:05.577
Was it an explosion
of magical feedback?

09:05.679 --> 09:06.478
An evocation?

09:06.580 --> 09:07.678
A kind of incantation?

09:07.780 --> 09:10.115
It's Starswirl, so the
possibilities are endless!

09:10.817 --> 09:12.417
And once Starlight set
me on the right track

09:12.519 --> 09:13.819
with his crazy hornwriting--

09:13.921 --> 09:15.554
[snigger] I mean, he was a genius,

09:15.656 --> 09:17.522
so I guess we can forgive
a little messiness --

09:17.724 --> 09:20.492
I went through the journal
again and it's amazing!

09:21.094 --> 09:24.763
Twilight, darling, we
understand you're excited,

09:24.965 --> 09:26.231
but that's all we understand.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.867
What exactly is so amazing?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.002
Only how Starswirl
and the other Pillars

09:31.104 --> 09:33.204
sent the Pony of
Shadows to limbo!

09:33.506 --> 09:34.873
They did what now?

09:38.344 --> 09:41.012
They used their magic to
open a portal between worlds,

09:41.114 --> 09:43.948
to limbo and pulled the
Pony of Shadows inside.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.518
Darling, your diorama!

09:46.920 --> 09:47.752
I made more.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.757
Starswirl thought the only way
to trap the Pony of Shadows

09:52.859 --> 09:54.926
in limbo was for the
Pillars to take him there.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.763
So they got stuck too!

09:58.265 --> 10:01.199
The Pony of Shadows must
have been really awful

10:01.301 --> 10:02.735
for them to do that.

10:03.237 --> 10:06.171
I suppose being trapped for all
time with a super-duper bad guy

10:06.273 --> 10:08.674
in limbo might be OK if
you were doing the limbo,

10:09.076 --> 10:10.209
but that's still pushing it.

10:10.411 --> 10:13.378
The thing is, I think
I can get them out.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.081
Twilight, are you serious?

10:16.183 --> 10:19.784
You can save the most
legendary ponies of all time?

10:19.886 --> 10:20.986
I don't know..

10:21.188 --> 10:25.257
Opening portals between worlds
didn't work out well for me.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.292
Are you sure it's safe?

10:27.494 --> 10:30.228
First of all, you opened
portals through time.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.397
And second of all,
Starswirl wrote the spell

10:32.499 --> 10:33.298
you used to do it.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.434
If he'd been here, he
could have stopped it.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.303
Equestria would be
safer with him in it.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.771
We have to save him.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.108
But you'd be savin'
all the Pillars, right?

10:43.410 --> 10:45.310
And they disappeared
ages ago.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.345
That's the thing
about limbo.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.147
It isn't one
place or another.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.783
It's in between, so
time stands still.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.353
If we can pull them out, it'll
be like they never left!

10:54.555 --> 10:56.721
I actually built another
model to demonstrate--

10:56.823 --> 10:57.322
Agh!

10:58.458 --> 10:59.858
What can we do to help?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.493
If I'm right, we need to find
items that are connected

11:02.595 --> 11:04.029
to the Pillars in some way.

11:04.131 --> 11:07.098
You mean, like, stuff
that belonged to them?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.934
How would we know
what to look for?

11:09.236 --> 11:10.336
Or where?

11:11.038 --> 11:13.906
Luckily, Starswirl
took a lot of notes.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.542
<i> My compatriots are as varied</i>
<i> as the realm itself</i>

11:17.644 --> 11:20.111
<i> and hail from every</i>
<i> corner of our land,</i>

11:20.313 --> 11:23.982
<i> bringing with them artifacts</i>
<i> and talismans of great power.</i>

11:24.184 --> 11:26.686
Um, Twilight, what
are you doing?

11:27.888 --> 11:29.254
I'm not doing anything!

11:31.023 --> 11:32.457
Rockhoof's shovel!

11:32.759 --> 11:34.793
Flash Magnus' shield!

11:35.095 --> 11:36.661
Mistmane's flower!

11:36.963 --> 11:38.930
Meadowbrook's mask!

11:39.032 --> 11:41.032
And the blindfold
Somnambula wore

11:41.134 --> 11:43.268
when she faced
that nasty sphinx!

11:44.904 --> 11:47.338
I guess we don't need to figure
out who should get what!

11:53.347 --> 11:56.081
Professor! It's a
Mighty Helm headpiece!

11:56.283 --> 11:58.850
Maybe it belonged
to Rockhoof himself!

11:59.252 --> 12:01.286
Legends don't wear helmets.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.322
This belonged to a real pony.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.924
Applejack: Oh, I
can guarantee

12:06.026 --> 12:08.293
Rockhoof was as real
as you and me.

12:10.697 --> 12:14.766
And I suppose that ravine was
dug with his trusty shovel

12:14.868 --> 12:17.702
to save the village from
an erupting volcano.

12:18.104 --> 12:18.770
Probably.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.207
I love old legends
as much as anypony,

12:22.409 --> 12:25.577
but a pony strong enough to save
a village from rushing lava

12:25.679 --> 12:28.947
with a shovel is... preposterous!

12:41.560 --> 12:44.095
I can't believe
you just did that...

12:44.497 --> 12:45.864
You saved us!

12:46.266 --> 12:48.633
I bet if you told
somepony else the story,

12:48.735 --> 12:51.569
it might sound...
<i> preposterous</i>.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.946
I suppose some
stories.. might be true.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.986
And Rockhoof's appears
to be one of them!

13:18.864 --> 13:19.864
[slap]
OW!

13:19.934 --> 13:22.801
You keep those hooves
to yourself, dearie!

13:23.203 --> 13:26.638
This place has been in my
family for generations

13:26.740 --> 13:29.440
and I'm not about to
let some whippersnapper

13:29.542 --> 13:31.843
take the last good
piece of it!

13:32.145 --> 13:36.681
Time was, ponies came from far
and wide to see these gardens.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.485
But that flower's the only
worthwhile thing left!

13:57.804 --> 14:00.739
Perhaps it just seemed like
your gardens were worthless,

14:00.941 --> 14:03.408
but a little pruning
can work wonders.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.777
Of course you will
have to look after

14:05.879 --> 14:07.746
more than just
one flower now.

14:08.548 --> 14:12.317
You've given me back
my family's legacy.

14:13.119 --> 14:16.988
The flower you wanted seems
like a fair trade for that.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.161
I can't believe Flash
Magnus' shield

14:23.263 --> 14:25.297
ended up in the Dragon Lands.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.333
Good thing you brought the
Official Equestrian Friendship

14:28.435 --> 14:31.370
Ambassador To The Dragons to
help you navigate our customs.

14:31.772 --> 14:34.372
Like our favorite
sport: gorge surfing!

14:34.774 --> 14:41.246
Whoo hoo! HA HA AH AH!

14:44.684 --> 14:48.020
OK. That was
awesome!

14:48.922 --> 14:52.523
Dragon Lord Ember commanded
us to make peace with ponies,

14:52.725 --> 14:55.560
but it doesn't mean you
can surf in our spot.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.597
Whoa! Fellas.

14:58.699 --> 15:00.699
As the Official Equestrian
Friendship Ambassador

15:00.801 --> 15:04.102
To The Dragons, I have to say,
that's not very friendly.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.238
Garble: Well, what do
you know?

15:06.640 --> 15:11.209
The puny, pony dragon's
sticking up for his pony pal.

15:12.678 --> 15:15.246
Hey! That's an ancient
pony artifact.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.849
Hooves off my gorge board!

15:17.951 --> 15:21.186
I found it in the desert
and finders keepers.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.521
It isn't yours.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.724
Huh. It sure looks like mine.

15:25.826 --> 15:29.227
But, I might consider
racing you for it.

15:29.829 --> 15:30.962
No problem.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.031
Um, no.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.834
I mean.. you.

15:36.036 --> 15:36.835
Heh heh.

15:47.313 --> 15:48.513
On your marks...

15:48.715 --> 15:49.781
Get set...

15:49.883 --> 15:50.982
Surf!

16:04.898 --> 16:08.666
[pants] I won? I won! WOOO-HOOO!

16:08.768 --> 16:10.636
Give up the shield, Garble.

16:11.838 --> 16:15.406
Lord Ember only commanded
us to be nice to ponies.

16:15.508 --> 16:20.278
She never said anything
about pony-loving dragons.

16:24.183 --> 16:27.218
Uh.. since Dragon Lord Ember
commanded you

16:27.320 --> 16:29.721
to make peace with ponies,
you can't very well

16:29.823 --> 16:32.290
attack one of their
friends, can you?

16:33.959 --> 16:35.360
I guess we'll find out!

16:41.300 --> 16:44.970
Ugh. Why is he always
hiding behind ponies?

16:45.172 --> 16:47.606
I wasn't hiding when I
beat you down the ridge.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.308
You fell.

16:49.810 --> 16:53.244
Wow, you must be slow, if
all Spike had to do to win

16:53.346 --> 16:54.713
was fall down.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.347
I'm faster than you.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.282
Doubt it.

16:57.384 --> 16:57.983
Fine.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.784
I'll race you back to the top.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.387
If you win, you can
have your pony junk.

17:02.989 --> 17:07.359
But if I win, you'll leave
and I get to give it to him!

17:07.661 --> 17:10.695
Fine. I'm pretty sure I
could beat you anyway,

17:10.897 --> 17:13.531
but with that heavy hunk
of metal on your back,

17:13.733 --> 17:15.300
it'll be a snap.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.702
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Thanks for the tip.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.571
See ya at the top, loser!

17:26.345 --> 17:28.580
Hey! That's mine!

17:28.882 --> 17:31.416
Finders keepers, remember?

17:32.418 --> 17:34.619
See, because that's
what you said to them

17:34.721 --> 17:36.086
when they first
showed up and--

17:43.863 --> 17:46.998
Just remember not to
turn away from them, Cattail.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.634
Flash bees can get
pretty aggressive.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.803
I guess that's why none of
the other bayou animals

17:51.905 --> 17:52.971
can get to the water.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.041
Wouldn't it make more sense
for you to wear the mask

17:57.143 --> 17:58.277
that calms the bees?

17:58.679 --> 18:03.614
It would... if I didn't have to
fly up here to move their hive.

18:05.517 --> 18:06.184
There!

18:10.856 --> 18:12.791
Now the other bayou creatures
can get to the water

18:12.893 --> 18:14.793
without the bees
feeling threatened.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.530
You know, you didn't
have to help with this.

18:18.732 --> 18:21.065
I would've lent you
the mask anyway.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.734
I know. [giggle]

18:22.836 --> 18:24.536
But I couldn't leave
without helping.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.474
I don't think anypony can
find anything in there.

18:30.076 --> 18:32.243
I wouldn't give
up hope just yet.

18:38.817 --> 18:41.085
This old blindfold was
stuck in the drain.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.221
Weren't you looking
for a blindfold?

18:43.523 --> 18:44.689
Oh, yeah!

18:49.194 --> 18:51.863
I can't believe I'm going to
meet Starswirl the Bearded,

18:52.165 --> 18:53.798
you know, outside of my dreams..

18:53.900 --> 18:56.234
I can't believe you're actually
going through with it.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.436
What do you mean?

18:58.338 --> 19:00.639
I'm all for pushing the
envelope, obviously,

19:00.841 --> 19:03.208
but this is pretty out
there for you, Twilight.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.511
What's "out there" about saving
the most legendary ponies

19:06.613 --> 19:09.580
of all time from a
thousands year-old prison?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.651
Well, nothing when
you say it like that.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.087
Unless "the most legendary
ponies of all time"

19:16.189 --> 19:19.057
knew what they were doing and
we shouldn't mess with it.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.627
I'm sure Starswirl and the
Pillars did the best they could

19:22.729 --> 19:25.930
back then, but magic
has come a long way,

19:26.132 --> 19:28.333
mostly because of
the work they did.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.735
That's true. And you
did get your wings

19:30.837 --> 19:32.837
from finishing one of
Starswirl's spells.

19:33.839 --> 19:34.840
Exactly.

19:35.942 --> 19:40.044
But, then I messed with one and
nearly destroyed the universe,

19:40.146 --> 19:41.112
so...

19:41.314 --> 19:44.082
Starlight, Starswirl the
Bearded is the greatest wizard

19:44.184 --> 19:45.150
who ever lived.

19:45.452 --> 19:48.686
The chance to have him back in
Equestria is worth the risk.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.888
Spike: That's good news.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.925
Otherwise, we'd have brought
this shield for nothing!

19:54.027 --> 19:55.860
Applejack: I hope you don't
think you're the only one

19:55.962 --> 20:00.031
to find her artifact, because
this here shovel says otherwise.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.600
Honestly, you two...

20:02.702 --> 20:04.569
Not everything is a competition.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.405
But.. Mistmane's
flower is by far

20:07.507 --> 20:09.207
the most attractive
of the artifacts.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.743
You're just saying that because
you didn't have to scuba dive

20:11.845 --> 20:14.312
in a pit of green
slime to get yours.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.781
Or move a Flash Bee hive.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.416
Good work everyone.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.853
Let's do this!

20:43.676 --> 20:45.910
What-- What has happened?

20:46.712 --> 20:49.080
It worked! We brought you back!

20:49.282 --> 20:50.414
To where?

20:50.516 --> 20:52.250
You and the others have
been trapped in limbo

20:52.352 --> 20:53.784
for over a thousand years,

20:53.986 --> 20:55.720
but I figured out
how to get you ho--

20:55.822 --> 20:56.687
What!?

20:56.789 --> 21:00.258
No, no, no, no! You must
undo what you've done!

21:00.560 --> 21:01.759
What? Why?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.861
I mean, I don't
think I can.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.264
You cannot
bring us back!

21:06.466 --> 21:07.265
But I did.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.033
I brought all the Pillars back.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.402
You cannot bring only
the Pillars back...

21:28.320 --> 21:29.387
Oh, no...
