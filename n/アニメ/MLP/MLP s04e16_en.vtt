00:04.831 --> 00:06.798
<i>OK, everypony, as you know,</i>

00:07.061 --> 00:09.648
the adorable fairy
creatures known as Breezies

00:09.851 --> 00:11.662
are about to come
through Ponyville.

00:11.949 --> 00:14.505
Yes! It's so exciting!

00:15.028 --> 00:16.881
I can't wait for Rainbow Dash
to make the breeze for them

00:16.940 --> 00:19.287
so I can see how cute
they are up close!

00:19.560 --> 00:21.080
I've never done it before.

00:21.346 --> 00:23.120
Not that I won't be
totally awesome at it.

00:23.244 --> 00:24.675
Because I totally will.

00:24.946 --> 00:26.899
And that breeze
is very important.

00:27.082 --> 00:29.775
But so is cheering on those
teeny, tiny little things

00:29.962 --> 00:31.990
so they have the confidence
to ride that breeze

00:32.000 --> 00:32.975
to their native land.

00:33.521 --> 00:35.020
Did I mention how tiny they are?

00:35.461 --> 00:36.238
So tiny.

00:37.789 --> 00:40.768
I was thinking we could do
a special Breezy cheer.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.480
I LOVE CHEERS!

00:43.804 --> 00:46.419
But these cheers
should be quiet cheers.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.672
We don't want to
startle them.

00:47.957 --> 00:49.518
They need to be
able to concentrate.

00:50.249 --> 00:51.990
Why don't we try it?

00:52.126 --> 00:53.970
You can do it, Breezies.

00:54.224 --> 00:56.185
YOU CAN DO IT, BREEZIES!

00:56.403 --> 00:56.872
Oh my.

00:57.890 --> 01:00.735
Sorry, Fluttershy, I had
no idea how hard it was

01:00.743 --> 01:02.421
to do a cheer quietly.

01:03.250 --> 01:06.345
It's OK. Quiet doesn't come
naturally for everypony.

01:06.702 --> 01:07.758
Let's try it again.

01:08.228 --> 01:10.474
YOU CAN DO IT, BREEZIES!

01:11.077 --> 01:13.465
Perhaps just a
little bit quieter.

01:13.914 --> 01:16.050
You can do it, Breezies!

01:16.706 --> 01:17.992
Just a little quieter.

01:18.372 --> 01:20.682
You can do it, Breezies!

01:21.153 --> 01:22.144
PERFECT!

01:22.946 --> 01:25.160
Oh, um, I mean...yay.

01:32.723 --> 01:37.720

02:20.757 --> 02:22.499
That's too strong!

02:23.092 --> 02:24.930
We've gotta slow
this breeze down

02:24.940 --> 02:27.061
or we're going to blow
those Breezies apart!

02:29.672 --> 02:32.181
What I don't understand is
why they need the Pegasi

02:32.197 --> 02:33.514
to make a breeze for them.

02:33.826 --> 02:36.013
Well, you see,
it's the breeze

02:36.021 --> 02:38.003
that activates the
Breezie's magic.

02:38.263 --> 02:40.585
And that magic protects the
pollen they're carrying

02:40.597 --> 02:41.806
from being destroyed.

02:42.267 --> 02:46.731
So no breeze means no magic
means the pollen goes bad?

02:47.006 --> 02:47.787
That's right.

02:47.927 --> 02:50.450
And they only have two days
to get that pollen back

02:50.675 --> 02:52.987
before the portal to
their home closes.

02:53.438 --> 02:55.209
That's why it's
ever so important

02:55.215 --> 02:57.890
that we help them make their
way through Ponyville safely.

02:58.454 --> 03:00.214
We certainly wouldn't
want to scare them

03:00.220 --> 03:01.925
and divert them from their path!

03:02.302 --> 03:03.836
Now you understand.

03:04.376 --> 03:06.120
You certainly know
a lot about them.

03:06.727 --> 03:07.832
Oh, thank you.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.748
I went to see them
gathering their pollen

03:09.754 --> 03:11.055
in Western Equestria.

03:17.346 --> 03:20.987
Um, Rarity, I hate
to weigh in with you

03:20.995 --> 03:23.059
when it comes to fashion, but--

03:23.884 --> 03:25.875
There's too much
purple on this, isn't there?

03:25.966 --> 03:27.071
I KNEW it!

03:27.683 --> 03:29.272
But Twilight
refused to admit it.

03:29.916 --> 03:30.530
What? I--

03:30.561 --> 03:32.794
No, no.
It's the perfect amount of purple.

03:32.885 --> 03:36.450
It's just that there's an awful
lot of sequins on your jacket.

03:36.792 --> 03:41.094
Oh, darling, please! One can
never have too many sequins.

03:41.935 --> 03:43.523
You can if they
reflect the sun

03:43.683 --> 03:45.912
and the light catches a group of
Breezies right in their eyes

03:46.066 --> 03:47.914
and blinds them long enough to
get them off their course

03:47.921 --> 03:49.061
so they never get home!

03:49.955 --> 03:50.969
I stand corrected.

03:51.139 --> 03:52.891
I suppose there is
the rare instance

03:52.940 --> 03:54.599
where one can have
too many sequins.

03:54.844 --> 03:56.267
I'll just take
off my jacket.

03:58.448 --> 04:00.292
I suppose this won't do either.

04:09.186 --> 04:10.989
Everypony, it's time!

04:11.410 --> 04:13.549
Please welcome the Breezies!

04:25.535 --> 04:28.645
They're as cute as Apple
Bloom on the day she was born!

04:28.903 --> 04:31.371
And would you look at those
adorable little packs

04:31.383 --> 04:32.798
they carry their pollen in.

04:36.253 --> 04:37.514
So! Cute!

04:37.982 --> 04:39.586
Can't! Take! It!

04:51.480 --> 04:54.345
Pinkie Pie! Can I hop on you
so I can see the Breezies?

04:54.481 --> 04:56.238
May! Explode!

05:10.544 --> 05:11.520
OH NO!

05:22.690 --> 05:25.826
Slow down the breeze for
the other group to catch up!

05:26.390 --> 05:27.399
They're too far back!

05:27.804 --> 05:30.466
We can't connect the breeze
to both sets of Breezies!

05:30.815 --> 05:32.093
What if we speed it up?

05:32.480 --> 05:34.626
Then the first group
will be going too fast

05:34.782 --> 05:36.532
and will get separated
from each other!

06:08.499 --> 06:09.674
<i>Manglemarsh mooth!</i>

06:10.095 --> 06:10.868
He's right!

06:11.061 --> 06:13.670
You must all gather as
close as you possibly can!

06:23.855 --> 06:25.360
Muggledy Sarken dose?

06:25.685 --> 06:29.053
Oh. I understand the language
of all kinds of creatures.

06:29.738 --> 06:31.059
You must be so proud.

06:31.498 --> 06:33.365
And you speak my language, too?

06:33.629 --> 06:36.546
I can. This lot can
only understand you.

06:36.723 --> 06:39.422
Clearly, they're not the
brightest bunch around.

06:42.220 --> 06:44.901
THAT...WAS...AMAZING!

06:45.045 --> 06:46.868
I'm sorry we couldn't
get a breeze going

06:46.876 --> 06:48.558
that would get them
back to the others.

06:49.957 --> 06:51.385
Oh, it's not your fault.

06:51.523 --> 06:53.797
I for one am very proud
of you, Fluttershy.

06:53.988 --> 06:55.637
Leaping into action
like that.

06:55.826 --> 06:58.560
I feel like I should design
you a special hero's gown.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.446
Or a sash. At least a sash.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.818
<i>OK, OK, OK!</i>

07:03.986 --> 07:06.437
I know what you're all thinking.
Why don't you just say it?

07:06.618 --> 07:08.848
I'm sorry!

07:09.311 --> 07:10.770
<i>This is all my fault!</i>

07:10.981 --> 07:13.480
I'm so, so sorry!

07:13.695 --> 07:15.687
Oh, Spike, it's OK.

07:15.998 --> 07:17.892
It could have happened
to any one of us.

07:19.572 --> 07:21.744
OK. Thank you!

07:24.288 --> 07:26.891
Uh, I'm just going to
stay over here.

07:27.590 --> 07:30.335
So Fluttershy, you want us to
get the breeze going again

07:30.347 --> 07:32.163
so these little guys
can get a move on?

07:35.400 --> 07:37.683
Maybe we should wait
just a moment or so.

07:38.048 --> 07:39.584
They've been through so much.

07:41.299 --> 07:43.332
Just give me the word when
you think they're ready.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.746
Oh my, Twirly, you look
like you need a blanket.

08:04.595 --> 08:05.328
Sampkin.

08:05.738 --> 08:06.337
No problem.

08:07.976 --> 08:08.550
Melanky?

08:09.285 --> 08:11.200
Oh. Did you need
some more water?

08:16.115 --> 08:18.766
Now who else needed a
hoof-knitted sweater?

08:22.021 --> 08:22.712
Hey there!

08:22.913 --> 08:23.557
Can we come in?

08:23.898 --> 08:24.720
Oh, of course.

08:25.551 --> 08:26.452
But watch your step.

08:27.687 --> 08:29.678
Oops. Sorry about
that little one.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.974
We just wanted to see if you
thought the Breezies were ready

08:31.986 --> 08:32.954
to give it another try.

08:33.545 --> 08:34.887
Has it been an hour already?

08:35.137 --> 08:36.062
My goodness.

08:36.429 --> 08:38.343
Time flies when you're making
sure little creatures

08:38.359 --> 08:39.890
don't feel that you're
abandoning them

08:39.900 --> 08:41.229
<i>to the cruel world.</i>

08:42.829 --> 08:45.594
But they're not going
to a cruel world, right?

08:45.896 --> 08:47.123
They're going home.

08:50.202 --> 08:51.861
Oh yes! That's right.

08:55.289 --> 08:56.848
On second thought.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.782
I don't think
they're quite ready.

08:58.860 --> 09:04.524
Marshkin pupskin larfer!
Farclop pannywafer!

09:05.203 --> 09:06.751
Uh, what did he say?

09:07.523 --> 09:09.521
I'd rather not say.

09:10.329 --> 09:13.077
OK, well, I'm sure you
know what you're doing.

09:13.447 --> 09:15.935
No one knows rare magical
creatures like you do.

09:16.388 --> 09:17.510
We'll just wait for your word.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.464
Thank you.

09:18.716 --> 09:20.179
I'll be in touch very soon.

09:21.584 --> 09:24.587
We need to go NOW or
we will never get home!

09:24.856 --> 09:27.201
I wish we did not need
that stupid breeze

09:27.213 --> 09:28.534
to activate our magic

09:28.673 --> 09:31.709
or I would just force you
all to fly home right now!

09:32.134 --> 09:34.985
Why do we have to need magic
to keep our pollen safe?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.558
Now Seabreeze--

09:36.706 --> 09:38.556
Why are you giving
in to these wimps?

09:38.880 --> 09:41.496
If they had not been so
scared in the first place,

09:41.506 --> 09:43.408
this never would have happened!

09:43.773 --> 09:46.177
Well, that is just
not true, Seabreeze.

09:46.407 --> 09:49.752
It was because of a
leaf and you know that.

09:50.015 --> 09:51.278
Oh, please!

09:51.428 --> 09:54.066
They have no idea what
they're doing out there!

09:54.427 --> 09:57.683
Like you said, we need as
much time as we can get,

09:57.818 --> 10:00.068
because they are so incompetent!

10:00.273 --> 10:04.212
Well, I didn't say that
exactly, now did I?

10:04.811 --> 10:05.233
Huh!

10:06.185 --> 10:08.870
Oh, well, maybe a snack
will lighten the mood.

10:19.900 --> 10:20.696
Munfarzen.

10:20.950 --> 10:21.904
You're excused.

10:24.649 --> 10:27.553
Well, my Breezies? I
think we can all agree

10:27.564 --> 10:29.779
that now that you've eaten and
you have a little energy

10:29.783 --> 10:31.237
going in your Breezy bodies,

10:31.471 --> 10:33.617
you're strong enough
to face the breeze!

10:34.405 --> 10:37.250
I've loved having you here and
I hope I've made you all feel

10:37.264 --> 10:38.320
loved and special.

10:38.618 --> 10:41.767
But you have to go; no
pony here will deny that.

10:41.777 --> 10:44.628
<i>There is nothing special</i>
<i>about these losers!</i>

10:45.352 --> 10:48.044
They cannot handle a
simple breeze home!

10:48.318 --> 10:52.025
If they could just stick with
the program and listen to me,

10:52.035 --> 10:54.323
we would be safe! AT HOME!

10:55.246 --> 10:58.778
Home! Where everybreezie
is like us!

11:07.972 --> 11:09.488
OK. Well.

11:09.865 --> 11:11.845
A confusing pep talk,
but nonetheless,

11:12.245 --> 11:13.955
I do know that if you
don't leave soon,

11:14.230 --> 11:17.198
you may never make it back
and that would be terrible.

11:19.201 --> 11:19.998
Achoo!

11:20.335 --> 11:21.338
Multy marshkin follow.

11:24.930 --> 11:26.891
MULTY marskin toomba too.

11:27.570 --> 11:29.678
I had no idea you
all have colds!

11:30.058 --> 11:32.021
Really? All of you?

11:34.323 --> 11:37.030
Oh dear. I can't let you
go out there sick!

11:37.434 --> 11:39.843
What kind of a friend would
I be if I made you go now?

11:54.747 --> 11:55.666
Hey, Fluttershy.

11:55.910 --> 11:58.056
Just wondering if the
Breezies are ready to go yet.

11:58.230 --> 12:00.040
Clock's kind of ticking
for them to make it back

12:00.054 --> 12:01.777
before the door
closes on their home.

12:01.949 --> 12:04.282
Oh yes. I mean, not quite.

12:04.364 --> 12:06.236
Um, maybe just a
few more minutes?

12:08.173 --> 12:09.564
Uh... all right.

12:09.978 --> 12:11.880
We wait too much longer,
we'll have to create

12:11.894 --> 12:14.614
such a strong breeze it may
be more than they can handle.

12:15.498 --> 12:17.428
We just have to
trust Fluttershy.

12:17.672 --> 12:19.420
She must know what
she's doing.

12:37.892 --> 12:39.049
Awwww!

12:39.553 --> 12:41.861
Why are you spending
your time on this?

12:41.982 --> 12:43.781
I will never get home!

12:45.268 --> 12:48.134
Breezies, I must say,
Seabreeze has a point.

12:48.321 --> 12:50.583
I think it's time for me to get
Rainbow Dash and her friends

12:50.593 --> 12:52.813
so they can create the breeze
for you to get home.

12:56.362 --> 12:58.969
Oh. You're all awfully anxious.

13:00.245 --> 13:01.678
I don't want you
to feel abandoned

13:01.988 --> 13:04.645
or that I wasn't the most kind
host I could possibly be.

13:05.030 --> 13:06.335
Doshin bafin dorm.

13:06.712 --> 13:08.864
Yes, that does make sense.

13:09.274 --> 13:10.833
Seabreeze, do you
think you could wait

13:10.844 --> 13:11.927
<i>just a couple more hours?</i>

13:15.447 --> 13:17.568
Seabreeze? Seabreeze!

13:18.546 --> 13:20.349
Has anypony seen Seabreeze?

13:30.144 --> 13:31.859
Where is he going?

13:32.259 --> 13:34.737
There's no way he can handle
being out there on his own!

14:22.856 --> 14:24.154
<i>Excuse me, bees?</i>

14:25.658 --> 14:27.479
Can you please back
off my Breezy friend?

14:27.742 --> 14:28.848
He didn't mean any harm.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.460
It was just an accident.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.542
I'm working on a bee type dance

14:34.552 --> 14:35.791
<i>and was hoping you</i>
<i>could help me.</i>

14:36.105 --> 14:38.261
<i>Does this bring to mind</i>
<i>any images for you?</i>

14:38.571 --> 14:39.668
<i>Perhaps a bee?</i>

14:42.302 --> 14:43.233
<i>Excuse me!</i>

14:43.870 --> 14:48.245
I have done NOTHING but be kind,
but I guess that is NOT working!

14:48.398 --> 14:50.913
You bees know better than
to hurt a helpless Breezie!

14:51.215 --> 14:55.484
I demand that you go away NOW
or you'll have to answer to ME!

15:00.072 --> 15:01.112
Mankylin!

15:01.223 --> 15:04.142
Thank you. Thank you so much.

15:04.483 --> 15:06.415
Thank you for coming after me.

15:06.790 --> 15:07.962
<i>Of course!</i>

15:08.218 --> 15:10.720
You could have gotten
seriously hurt out there!

15:11.170 --> 15:13.194
Ponyville is much too
dangerous for you!

15:13.504 --> 15:15.467
One tiny acorn is a threat!

15:15.865 --> 15:17.160
Yeah! I know.

15:17.324 --> 15:18.973
That is one reason why

15:18.985 --> 15:22.179
I have been trying to get us
to go from the beginning!

15:22.481 --> 15:23.502
Oh my goodness.

15:24.134 --> 15:26.979
I was just trying not to
hurt any creature's feelings,

15:27.424 --> 15:30.347
my displays of kindness
may have cost you everything!

15:31.012 --> 15:34.007
Time is running out and
you may never make it home!

15:34.345 --> 15:37.330
That is exactly what I have
been telling all of them,

15:37.344 --> 15:39.272
but they do not listen to me.

15:39.424 --> 15:41.925
No Breezie
ever listens to me.

15:43.541 --> 15:46.733
Seabreeze, I understand
your feelings are hurt,

15:47.018 --> 15:49.305
but it's hard for them to hear
you when you're shouting

15:49.319 --> 15:50.378
and being mean.

15:50.696 --> 15:52.524
The message doesn't get across.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.110
But what about those bees?

15:55.391 --> 15:57.553
You were not nice to them

15:57.717 --> 16:00.413
and that was the only
way they listened.

16:00.714 --> 16:03.032
Yes, but they HAD to go.

16:03.508 --> 16:05.914
And they wouldn't listen
to me any other way.

16:12.158 --> 16:14.111
We need to go. Now!

16:24.120 --> 16:25.525
<i>My dear Breezies,</i>

16:25.789 --> 16:28.403
I had to rescue Seabreeze
from serious harm.

16:28.790 --> 16:31.118
And now I know more than
ever that you must leave

16:31.123 --> 16:32.302
before it's too late.

16:32.606 --> 16:34.659
You would never
survive in Ponyville.

16:36.450 --> 16:38.509
Mulshy barfin gorfis.

16:38.876 --> 16:40.517
I can't help you anymore!

16:40.930 --> 16:44.199
In fact, I wasn't helping
you at all by being nice.

16:45.307 --> 16:48.074
But the truth of the matter
is that I must be firm!

16:50.585 --> 16:51.867
You must go.

16:52.267 --> 16:52.897
NOW!

17:11.799 --> 17:13.028
It's too strong!

17:14.066 --> 17:15.880
I can't do it any lighter!

17:16.852 --> 17:18.066
Neither can I!

17:18.723 --> 17:21.832
Fly back! I'm going to try and
see if I can slow it down!

17:27.334 --> 17:28.731
Now it's too light!

17:29.121 --> 17:30.735
This will never get them home!

17:33.529 --> 17:36.489
Oh my. Maybe it's because
there are too few of them.

17:36.801 --> 17:38.696
When they started their
journey there was more of them

17:38.704 --> 17:40.277
to face the breeze together.

17:40.532 --> 17:42.070
I've been studying
an old spell book

17:42.081 --> 17:43.635
from the Castle of
the Two Sisters.

17:44.087 --> 17:45.904
There's a spell that
I think could help us.

17:46.485 --> 17:48.919
This is probably going to
feel a little funny at first,

17:49.045 --> 17:50.417
but you're going to
have to trust me.

17:52.643 --> 17:55.621
I love new ideas that make
me feel funny at first!

18:13.373 --> 18:14.161
Whoo!

18:27.373 --> 18:28.839
Marful fly bartontook.

18:30.524 --> 18:32.007
Um, I mean, let's go.

18:54.813 --> 18:55.908
Marshkin parskin.

18:56.232 --> 18:56.932
Mikar.

18:57.451 --> 18:58.895
You can do this.

18:59.112 --> 19:01.432
I am sorry for how I
treated you before.

19:01.703 --> 19:03.871
It was not right that
I called you names.

19:03.998 --> 19:06.286
I did not even really believe
those things I said.

19:06.565 --> 19:09.194
I was worried we would never
get back to our home,

19:09.457 --> 19:10.485
and I lashed out.

19:12.911 --> 19:14.796
I know you can do this.

19:14.932 --> 19:16.501
I believe in you.

19:17.898 --> 19:20.074
Hold onto me, let us
join the group.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.937
Holy mini-sized paradise!

19:46.840 --> 19:48.561
This is simply beautiful!

19:49.155 --> 19:50.727
So much inspiration!

19:50.731 --> 19:52.700
Where is my sketch
pad when I need it?

19:52.842 --> 19:54.643
SO! STINKIN'! CUTE!

20:08.364 --> 20:09.621
You OK, Fluttershy?

20:09.910 --> 20:12.848
I'm just so very happy they
got to be reunited

20:12.852 --> 20:13.668
with their family.

20:19.086 --> 20:20.909
We'd better get going
before the entrance,

20:21.041 --> 20:23.047
<i>well, exit for us, closes.</i>

20:26.193 --> 20:28.072
Goodbye, Breezies.
I must go now.

20:30.481 --> 20:31.791
To remember us by.

20:35.849 --> 20:36.470
Thank you.

20:37.010 --> 20:37.711
I'll miss you.

20:37.855 --> 20:39.073
I'll miss all of you.

20:40.628 --> 20:42.247
<i>My experiences with</i>
<i>the Breezies</i>

20:42.259 --> 20:45.096
<i>have helped me to see that</i>
<i>kindness can take many forms.</i>

20:45.479 --> 20:48.534
<i>And sometimes being too kind</i>
<i>can actually keep a friend</i>

20:48.542 --> 20:50.050
from doing what they need to do.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.431
<i>Pushing them away</i>
<i>may seem cruel,</i>

20:52.948 --> 20:55.387
<i>but it's sometimes the</i>
<i>kindest thing you can do.</i>

20:59.564 --> 21:01.412
Whoa. That was a close one.

21:03.324 --> 21:04.591
OK, gather around!

21:11.994 --> 21:15.557
So, uh, I've always kind of
wondered what it would be like

21:15.560 --> 21:16.887
to be a Gryphon.

21:18.163 --> 21:19.229
Not a chance.

21:20.350 --> 21:23.367
You sure? What about a
dragon? No?

21:23.687 --> 21:25.855
It doesn't have to shoot fire!
