talk as much?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.386
What if we don't
stay friends?

10:28.329 --> 10:30.996
I know it's weird, but knowing
you're all are as upset as I am

10:31.098 --> 10:32.998
actually makes me less worried.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.500
That's nice, but you
should be more worried...

10:35.602 --> 10:37.502
about missing the
train to Canterlot!

10:39.006 --> 10:41.239
Sorry I'm so late! I actually
thought I'd missed you-

10:41.341 --> 10:42.574
Spike: There's no time!

10:46.447 --> 10:47.846
Oh, no. We missed it!

10:49.316 --> 10:50.215
But maybe...

10:51.418 --> 10:52.751
OK. We're on the train.

10:52.823 --> 10:54.439
Everything should
be fine, right?

10:56.040 --> 10:58.056
I'd worked out exactly
how much time I needed

10:58.158 --> 11:00.959
to weave my star spider
sash, and now I'm behind!

11:01.061 --> 11:02.294

11:02.396 --> 11:04.262

deliveries on his own.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.901

looking out for it.

And while we'll always
be here if you need us,

17:07.794 --> 17:09.728
it's time for us

So, even though
everything changed,

17:31.284 --> 17:32.984
and you moved away
from your friends,

17:33.086 --> 17:34.653
you didn't grow apart?

17:35.055 --> 17:37.422
And <i>THIS</i> is the
Council of Friendship.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.324

all doing here?

17:39.626 --> 17:42.027

we've been ruling together!

over the years.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.443
Sometimes friendships
can be hard,

17:58.545 --> 18:00.078
and it takes work
to maintain them,

18:00.180 --> 18:02.681

things can be a lot harder.

18:02.983 --> 18:04.449

about friendship

18:04.551 --> 18:07.386
being something to work
at.. and I don't mind work.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.854
I guess if they don't
have to fade away,

18:09.956 --> 18:13.192
maybe making friends isn't
the waste of time I thought!

18:13.594 --> 18:16.394
But.. I've been so
