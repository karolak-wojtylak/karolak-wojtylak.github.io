WEBVTT

00:00.561 --> 00:01.728
Where'd I put that...?

00:02.292 --> 00:03.521
Oh, I thought I already...

00:04.277 --> 00:06.377
Oh! And I can't forget I've got to...

00:06.857 --> 00:08.973
How am I ever gonna get this done?

00:09.301 --> 00:10.942
Are you sure I can't help?

00:10.992 --> 00:12.214
-I could...
-No.

00:12.215 --> 00:13.885
-Maybe just a...
-No, thanks.

00:13.886 --> 00:15.722
-How about...
-Just stand over there!

00:15.800 --> 00:18.228
-But...
-...where you'll be out of the way.

00:20.168 --> 00:22.652
Ribbon. Ribbon! Where's the ribbon?!

00:23.123 --> 00:24.086
I got it!

00:48.360 --> 00:51.582
Um... I'll just go and stand over there.

00:51.583 --> 00:54.254
Where I'll be... out of the way.

01:35.367 --> 01:38.060
Won't you at least let me
help you clean up?

01:38.292 --> 01:40.803
No. You've helped me quite enough.

01:40.804 --> 01:42.343
I'm sorry, sis.

01:42.344 --> 01:44.235
I just thought that if I
could help...

01:44.236 --> 01:48.351
...I might find my special gift
and finally earn my cutie mark.

01:50.201 --> 01:52.296
I understand. It's just that...

01:52.555 --> 01:55.042
I need this time to fill
this order without any...

01:55.778 --> 01:56.892
...complications.

01:58.733 --> 02:00.107
Okay. All done.

02:00.108 --> 02:01.571
Now back to work.

02:01.572 --> 02:04.864
I've lost a lot of time and I cannot
have any more interruptions.

02:06.436 --> 02:07.465
WHAT NOW?!

02:07.806 --> 02:10.814
Oh! Sorry. I thought the "open" sign
meant you were open, but...

02:10.815 --> 02:12.478
...I must have been mistaken.

02:12.853 --> 02:14.481
Fluttershy! Forgive me.

02:14.482 --> 02:19.085
I was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you
were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming.

02:19.086 --> 02:21.624
No worries, Rarity.
I've left her there in the basket.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.165
Ooh, she looks great.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.932
I just don't understand
how you're able to do it.

02:27.933 --> 02:31.014
I can't get near her without
getting a swipe from her claws.

02:32.584 --> 02:33.509
Did you use...

02:34.794 --> 02:36.195
...the Stare on her?

02:36.420 --> 02:39.104
Oh, no! I wouldn't. I couldn't!

02:39.105 --> 02:42.991
I... I don't really have any control over
when that happens. It just happens.

02:43.166 --> 02:46.893
No. I'm just good with animals.
It's my special gift, you know.

02:46.894 --> 02:51.032
Well, you should have a picture of Opal
as a cutie mark, instead of those butterflies.

02:51.033 --> 02:52.058
Ooh ooh oh oh!

02:52.059 --> 02:55.090
Oh oh! Maybe I can be
good with animals too?

02:58.394 --> 02:59.366
Or not.

03:01.585 --> 03:04.503
I'm sorry I can't invite you
to stay and chat, Fluttershy.

03:04.504 --> 03:06.980
I've bitten off a bit more than
I can chew with this order.

03:06.981 --> 03:08.687
But you're not eating anything.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.092
No, sweetie. It's an expression.

03:11.093 --> 03:13.653
It means that I've taken on
more work than I can handle.

03:13.654 --> 03:16.243
I've got twenty of these
special robes to make tonight.

03:16.244 --> 03:18.824
They're due in Trottingham
tomorrow morning.

03:22.525 --> 03:25.338
See? I've lined them
in a special gold silk.

03:25.339 --> 03:29.356
It took so long to make, but I think
it adds just the right touch, don't you?

03:29.357 --> 03:32.479
These are lovely, but...
Twenty? By tonight?

03:32.480 --> 03:34.429
How will you get it all done?

03:34.430 --> 03:35.934
Well, I...

03:35.935 --> 03:36.613
Oh oh oh!

03:36.614 --> 03:37.832
Maybe I could...

03:37.833 --> 03:41.864
...just... just stand
over here and watch?

03:42.064 --> 03:43.211
I'll manage.

03:43.212 --> 03:46.358
Well, maybe I should get out
of your mane, so you can work.

03:46.359 --> 03:47.678
HI, FLUTTERSHY!

03:47.679 --> 03:49.132
HI, RARITY!

03:49.322 --> 03:51.158
Hello, uh... girls.

03:51.159 --> 03:52.616
HEY, SWEETIE BELLE!

03:52.617 --> 03:54.618
Scootaloo! Apple Bloom!

03:54.619 --> 03:58.680
-You ready for tonight?
-Yep! Cutie mark planning session is a go!

03:58.681 --> 04:01.683
Tonight is the night we each try
to find our own special talent.

04:01.684 --> 04:03.617
Even if it takes us all night!

04:03.618 --> 04:05.265
I'm ready. You ready?

04:05.266 --> 04:06.455
Very ready!

04:06.456 --> 04:10.201
CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS'
SLEEPOVER AT RARITY'S! YAY!

04:10.202 --> 04:12.783
Aaand... look what I made us!

04:13.860 --> 04:15.239
Wow!

04:17.219 --> 04:19.572
That does that patch on your cape mean?

04:19.628 --> 04:22.773
THE CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS!
YAY!

04:22.774 --> 04:24.893
We're on a crusade! A mission!

04:24.894 --> 04:26.703
To find our cutie marks!

04:26.704 --> 04:28.110
Yup. And look.

04:28.111 --> 04:30.330
I lined them with
this special gold silk.

04:30.331 --> 04:32.069
It took so long to make...

04:32.070 --> 04:35.286
...but I think it adds just
the right touch. Don't you?

04:39.239 --> 04:41.863
Sweetie Belle! What have you done?!

04:41.864 --> 04:45.774
That was the last of the gold silk!
And now I'll have to make more!

04:45.974 --> 04:47.588
Oh, I hope I can make more.

04:47.589 --> 04:49.391
I'm gonna have to work all night!

04:49.901 --> 04:50.966
Which means...

04:51.249 --> 04:54.865
Sorry, girls. I'm afraid
the crusaders' sleepover is canceled.

04:54.942 --> 04:55.862
WHAT?!

04:55.863 --> 04:59.752
I just won't have any time to watch you
if I want to get these robes delivered on time.

04:59.753 --> 05:00.340
But...!

05:00.341 --> 05:02.082
No "buts" this time.

05:02.083 --> 05:04.803
I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle.
It's just the way it has to be.

05:07.024 --> 05:09.900
I, uh... I suppose I could
take them for the night.

05:12.436 --> 05:14.387
I couldn't ask you to do that.

05:14.388 --> 05:16.056
Oh, it's no problem at all.

05:16.156 --> 05:19.817
Have you met my sister and her friends?
A problem is all it would be.

05:19.818 --> 05:24.881
Did I have a problem with Opal?
You've seen how well I handle small creatures.

05:24.882 --> 05:27.851
I suppose that's true.
And I do have a lot of work to do.

05:27.852 --> 05:29.301
Come on. It'll be fun.

05:29.302 --> 05:31.213
I assure you they're quite a handful.

05:31.214 --> 05:33.116
These sweet little angels?

05:34.681 --> 05:36.295
Well...

05:36.879 --> 05:38.058
All right.

05:38.059 --> 05:42.076
CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS' SLEEPOVER
AT FLUTTERSHY'S COTTAGE!

05:42.077 --> 05:42.924
YAY!

05:42.925 --> 05:44.552
So cute.

05:44.917 --> 05:46.233
Wait for me!

05:51.739 --> 05:54.511
Oh. Won't this be ever so fun?

05:54.512 --> 05:56.544
We can have a nice little tea party...

05:56.545 --> 06:00.262
...and braid each other's tails,
and sit quietly, and color...

06:00.263 --> 06:02.273
...tell each other fairy tales, and...

06:09.079 --> 06:10.170
Hello, Fluttershy.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.546
Oh. Hello, Twilight. Where you off to?

06:13.547 --> 06:17.411
I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's
to get some of my favorite tea.

06:18.066 --> 06:19.862
T-The Everfree Forest?

06:19.863 --> 06:22.431
You'll be careful, won't you?

06:22.432 --> 06:25.268
Of course. How about you?
What are you doing with the girls?

06:25.627 --> 06:27.586
Rarity has a big order
to fill tonight...

06:27.587 --> 06:31.069
...so I volunteered to take the girls
over to my cottage for a sleepover.

06:31.070 --> 06:34.613
Wow. Sounds like everypony
has their hooves full today.

06:34.614 --> 06:37.775
Taking care of those
three fillies all by yourself?

06:37.776 --> 06:39.169
You sure you can handle it?

06:39.170 --> 06:42.891
What? These sweet little angels?

06:42.892 --> 06:44.945
They'll be no problem at all.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.902
Wow! Look at this place!

06:57.027 --> 06:59.468
No... problem at all.

06:59.469 --> 07:01.657
Okay, girls. What should we do?

07:01.658 --> 07:03.170
I'm gonna get my mark first!

07:03.171 --> 07:04.570
-Girls...?
-Nuh-uh.

07:04.571 --> 07:06.064
-Should we...?
-I am!

07:06.200 --> 07:08.261
Girls. O-okay now, sit down...

07:08.262 --> 07:09.556
I'm staying up all night!

07:09.557 --> 07:11.012
-Me too!
-Me three!

07:11.887 --> 07:13.811
Uh... I know you're excited, but...

07:14.111 --> 07:15.163
Girls.

07:15.474 --> 07:16.965
Oh. Oh, careful with the...

07:17.165 --> 07:17.905
Oh!

07:18.258 --> 07:19.340
Girls.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.379
So... What do you wanna do? Play a game?

07:25.579 --> 07:27.763
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

07:27.764 --> 07:30.416
And we want to crusade
for our cutie marks!

07:30.417 --> 07:32.955
And... And we... Um...

07:33.022 --> 07:34.601
Yeah! What they said.

07:35.564 --> 07:39.565
I don't know. How about a nice,
*quiet* little tea party?

07:39.566 --> 07:43.627
Or... we could go adventuring
in the Everfree Forest!

07:43.628 --> 07:44.983
YEAH!

07:46.155 --> 07:49.449
Oh, no! The Everfree Forest
is much too dangerous.

07:49.450 --> 07:52.395
It's filled with far too many
strange creatures.

07:52.396 --> 07:55.361
But you could go with us and
we could catch those creatures.

07:55.362 --> 07:56.618
We could be...

07:57.532 --> 07:58.893
...creature catchers!

07:59.286 --> 08:03.227
YAY! CUTIE MARK CRUSADER
CREATURE CATCHERS!

08:06.291 --> 08:11.895
Rawr! I am a dangerous creature
from the Everfree Forest! Rawr!

08:14.328 --> 08:16.696
Halt, dangerous creature
of the Everfree Forest!

08:16.697 --> 08:20.489
I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher.
And I'm here to catch you!

08:20.490 --> 08:25.569
You can never catch me!
I am far too powerful and dangerous.

08:25.570 --> 08:27.568
You cannot run from me!

08:32.928 --> 08:34.945
Um... Oh, maybe that's not such a...

08:35.368 --> 08:38.634
Now, girls. How about we
do some nice coloring?

08:39.532 --> 08:42.822
Come back, dangerous creature,
so I can catch you!

08:42.823 --> 08:43.911
Never!

08:44.560 --> 08:46.610
Careful... you don't...

08:47.872 --> 08:49.344
...break anything.

08:51.367 --> 08:53.084
Sorry, Fluttershy.

08:53.085 --> 08:54.664
Yeah. Sorry.

08:54.665 --> 08:57.306
I guess we aren't creature catchers.

08:57.416 --> 08:59.237
Oh, girls. It's okay. I...

08:59.238 --> 09:00.778
I know! We could be...

09:00.779 --> 09:02.972
Cutie Mark Crusader Carpenters!

09:02.973 --> 09:04.557
Carpenter...?

09:08.530 --> 09:09.203
Hammer.

09:09.235 --> 09:10.022
Hammer.

09:11.837 --> 09:12.634
Hammer.

09:12.851 --> 09:13.645
Hammer.

09:15.411 --> 09:16.309
Hammer.

09:17.137 --> 09:18.007
Hammer.

09:27.932 --> 09:30.201
Um... That doesn't look like a table.

09:30.202 --> 09:31.892
We were making a table?

09:31.893 --> 09:34.723
Somepony needs to put
this thing out of its misery.

09:34.889 --> 09:37.708
We are definitely not
Cutie Mark Carpenters.

09:37.816 --> 09:40.208
Who wants a picture of a hammer
on their flank anyway?

09:41.094 --> 09:44.783
Well... Now that we've gotten that
out of the way, how about a game?

09:44.784 --> 09:45.920
A game?

09:46.548 --> 09:48.465
It's called "Shhh!"

09:48.466 --> 09:49.846
What's that?

09:49.847 --> 09:53.806
Well, it's a game about who can be
quiet the longest. Sound fun?

09:55.752 --> 09:58.640
I'm the world champ, you know?
I bet you can't beat me.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.880
-I lose!
-Me too!
-Me three!

10:06.980 --> 10:08.750
Okay! Now what could we do?

10:08.931 --> 10:12.102
Oh! How about Cutie Mark
Crusader Coal Miners?

10:12.103 --> 10:13.268
YEAH!

10:13.269 --> 10:14.331
No!

10:14.332 --> 10:15.953
Awww...!

10:16.179 --> 10:18.678
I mean... it's time for bed,
don't you think?

10:18.679 --> 10:23.292
Aren't you excited to get all toasty and
warm in your snuggly-wuggly wittle beds?

10:23.293 --> 10:25.277
"Snuggly-wuggly"?

10:25.278 --> 10:27.471
But we have more crusadin' to do!

10:27.648 --> 10:29.137
We've got plans!

10:29.299 --> 10:30.641
And capes!

10:30.642 --> 10:34.634
Uh... Okay. Um, maybe
the crusading can wait until morning?

10:34.635 --> 10:37.501
When it's light and not so... dark?

10:38.133 --> 10:41.173
How are we gonna find
our special talent in our sleep?

10:41.924 --> 10:45.572
Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream
about your special talent.

10:45.573 --> 10:47.256
But we're not even tired!

10:48.665 --> 10:50.593
How about I sing you a lullaby?

10:50.837 --> 10:51.668
-Mhm...
-Yeah!

10:52.921 --> 10:57.880
<i>Hush now, quiet now,
It's time to lay your sleepy head.</i>

10:57.931 --> 11:03.523
<i>Hush now, quiet now,
It's time to go to bed.</i>

11:04.118 --> 11:05.275
I know this one!

11:05.794 --> 11:07.652
Oh, how wonderful.

11:07.653 --> 11:09.137
Why don't you sing it with me?

11:13.346 --> 11:17.015
<i>Hush now, quiet now,
This is time to lay your sleepy head!</i>

11:17.016 --> 11:20.704
<i>Said hush now, quiet now,
This is time to go to bed!</i>

11:20.705 --> 11:22.058
Okay, Sweetie, that was...

11:22.059 --> 11:25.821
<i>Drifting (drifting!) off to sleep!
The exciting day behind you!</i>

11:25.822 --> 11:29.474
<i>Drifting (drifting!) off to sleep!
Let the joy of dreamland find you!</i>

11:29.475 --> 11:30.729
Thank you, Sweetie, I'm...

11:30.730 --> 11:34.084
<i>Hush now! Quiet now!
Lay your sleepy head!</i>

11:34.085 --> 11:40.317
<i>Said hush now! Quiet now!
This is time to go to bed!!!</i>

11:40.318 --> 11:41.264
OW!

11:43.756 --> 11:44.941
What is that?

11:51.267 --> 11:52.430
Girls!

11:52.431 --> 11:55.217
Fluttershy! Your chickens
are on the loose.

11:55.218 --> 11:58.467
I wonder what could have caused that.

12:00.264 --> 12:03.561
Don't worry, Fluttershy.
The Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.364
Cutie Mark Crusader Chicken Herders!

12:06.365 --> 12:08.488
-YAY!
-No! I don't think that's a...

12:08.688 --> 12:09.690
Come back!

12:09.890 --> 12:10.848
Please!

12:11.897 --> 12:13.842
Come on, girls. The chickens are fine.

12:13.843 --> 12:16.066
Oh... Girls? No...

12:17.294 --> 12:18.199
GIRLS!

12:24.442 --> 12:25.408
Come on.

12:26.429 --> 12:27.499
In you go.

12:41.045 --> 12:42.870
There's some good chickens.

12:42.966 --> 12:46.911
Okay. You three. Isn't it
about time you got into bed?

12:46.912 --> 12:47.732
BUT...

12:47.733 --> 12:49.158
Please.

12:52.243 --> 12:55.302
So, no more crusading
for tonight, all right?

12:55.303 --> 12:56.678
Yes, Fluttershy.

12:56.679 --> 12:58.081
We promise, Fluttershy.

12:58.082 --> 12:59.326
Good night, Fluttershy.

12:59.327 --> 13:01.436
Okay. Good night.

13:04.841 --> 13:07.158
Okay. So what kind of
crusading do we do next?

13:07.159 --> 13:09.314
There's not much we
can do from this room.

13:09.315 --> 13:12.872
Unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader
Carpet Cleaners.

13:12.873 --> 13:15.129
Nnno, thanks.

13:15.130 --> 13:17.462
Well, we have to think of somethin'.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.226
We can't just waste this opportunity
to find out what our special talents are.

13:21.584 --> 13:22.710
Hey, girls!

13:23.251 --> 13:24.043
Look!

13:24.758 --> 13:26.840
Some of the chickens may have escaped.

13:27.481 --> 13:28.935
Into the forest!

13:30.081 --> 13:32.786
Cutie Mark Crusaders
Chicken Rescuers are go!

13:36.449 --> 13:38.918
It really wasn't that hard.

13:38.919 --> 13:42.250
I mean, all I needed to do is just
show them who's in charge.

13:42.251 --> 13:44.414
Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy.

13:44.586 --> 13:47.088
Good with animals, good with kids.

13:52.824 --> 13:53.750
Wait up!

13:56.541 --> 13:58.561
Peace and quiet.

13:59.795 --> 14:00.824
Too quiet.

14:05.329 --> 14:06.148
Girls?

14:08.226 --> 14:09.094
Girls?

14:09.907 --> 14:12.174
Elizabeak! She's missing!

14:12.175 --> 14:13.464
Girls?

14:13.756 --> 14:14.926
Oh no!

14:15.475 --> 14:17.875
They must have gone looking
for my missing chicken!

14:17.876 --> 14:20.338
Which means they must have gone into...

14:22.312 --> 14:24.920
...the Everfree Forest!

14:26.765 --> 14:28.887
Those girls have really
done it this time.

14:28.888 --> 14:31.678
They've really bitten off
more than they can chew.

14:32.862 --> 14:33.787
Just like me.

14:33.788 --> 14:36.321
I never should have
offered to watch them.

14:46.305 --> 14:47.832
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!

14:49.712 --> 14:51.259
What are you doing?

14:51.260 --> 14:52.963
Callin' for the chicken.

14:52.964 --> 14:55.314
That is not how you call a chicken.

14:55.315 --> 14:57.621
Oh, and you know how to call a chicken.

14:57.622 --> 14:59.569
I know that's not the way.

15:00.292 --> 15:01.655
Then show me.

15:01.962 --> 15:03.474
I don't have to show you.

15:03.475 --> 15:05.532
You're just chicken.

15:05.533 --> 15:06.983
AM NOT!

15:06.984 --> 15:09.767
Oh, wait! Now I know
how to call a chicken.

15:09.768 --> 15:13.562
Scootaloo! Scoot-Scootaloo!

15:13.563 --> 15:16.060
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

15:17.728 --> 15:19.948
You also forgot how to call a chicken.

15:20.202 --> 15:21.559
Why, you...!

15:21.560 --> 15:22.670
Come on, guys.

15:22.671 --> 15:26.654
We're not gonna find the chicken
*or* our cutie marks by arguing.

15:27.777 --> 15:30.848
Maybe that's our
special talent? Arguing!

15:30.849 --> 15:32.766
-Is not!
-Is too!

15:32.767 --> 15:35.875
-Is not!
-Is too! Anything yet?

15:36.362 --> 15:37.204
No.

15:37.403 --> 15:38.515
Darn...

15:41.011 --> 15:42.739
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick!

15:46.507 --> 15:47.483
Girls?

15:48.166 --> 15:49.505
Girls!

15:52.373 --> 15:54.276
Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy.

15:54.842 --> 15:56.877
Just put one hoof in front of the other.

15:58.111 --> 15:59.142
What was that?!

16:04.972 --> 16:07.507
Twilight? Is that you?

16:09.389 --> 16:11.301
Oh, Twilight. It is you.

16:11.401 --> 16:13.741
Thank goodness you're here. I need your help.

16:13.742 --> 16:16.163
The girls are out here somewhere
and I'm afraid that they're...

16:19.403 --> 16:21.142
W-What's happened to you?

16:23.557 --> 16:26.417
Oh no! If you've been turned
to stone, it must mean...

16:27.188 --> 16:29.294
Oh no! The girls!

16:29.672 --> 16:31.650
Don't move. I'll be back for you.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.088
Girls!

16:33.549 --> 16:35.380
-Is not!
-Is too!

16:35.381 --> 16:37.082
-Is not!
-Is too!

16:37.083 --> 16:40.493
Girls! Our special talent is *not* arguing.

16:40.494 --> 16:45.678
Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony
whose talent is arguing even look like?

16:45.679 --> 16:47.692
Girls! Girls!

16:47.693 --> 16:49.077
Fluttershy?

16:49.721 --> 16:52.192
Girls! Thank goodness I've found you.

16:52.266 --> 16:53.527
Fluttershy? What...

16:53.528 --> 16:55.977
Girls! We have to leave
the forest at once!

16:55.978 --> 16:58.083
But... we haven't found the chicken yet.

16:58.084 --> 17:01.048
There's no time for that.
There's a cockatrice on the loose.

17:01.218 --> 17:02.978
A cock-a-what now?

17:02.979 --> 17:06.562
A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with
a head of a chicken and the body of a snake.

17:06.563 --> 17:07.795
Now come on!

17:08.083 --> 17:10.451
The head of a chicken
and the body of a snake?

17:10.452 --> 17:13.057
That doesn't sound scary.
That sounds silly.

17:13.058 --> 17:16.491
Why, if I ever saw one of them
cock-a-thingies face to face...

17:16.492 --> 17:18.685
...I'd laugh at how silly it was.

17:18.686 --> 17:20.874
No! Never look one in the eye.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.687
-If you look the cockatrice in the eye...
-The chicken!

17:24.091 --> 17:25.109
Girls! Wait!

17:25.110 --> 17:26.852
HERE, CHICK-CHICK-CHICK!

17:33.022 --> 17:34.121
There it is!

17:35.611 --> 17:36.950
Two chickens?

17:37.174 --> 17:39.236
I thought only one escaped.

17:39.237 --> 17:40.574
Grab them both!

18:11.570 --> 18:13.133
See? Now we have to...

18:15.960 --> 18:17.729
Girls. Please... Girls.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.513
Listen to me, girls, I... Please!

18:25.328 --> 18:26.387
Girls!

18:27.042 --> 18:29.188
Behind me, now!

18:36.819 --> 18:37.691
YOU!

18:37.978 --> 18:41.717
Just who do you think you are,
going around turning others into stone?

18:44.358 --> 18:46.480
You should be ashamed of yourself!

18:46.481 --> 18:50.636
I am half a mind to find your mother and
tell her what you've been up to, young man.

18:53.923 --> 18:57.932
Now you go over there and turn Elizabeak
and my friend Twilight back to normal.

18:58.633 --> 19:01.946
And don't ever let me
catch you doing this again!

19:05.058 --> 19:07.089
Do you understand me?

19:10.036 --> 19:12.991
Are you girls all right?
I was so worried.

19:12.992 --> 19:14.482
Yeah! Fine!

19:14.483 --> 19:16.700
Thanks to that stare of yours.

19:16.701 --> 19:19.052
You're, like, the queen of stares!

19:19.053 --> 19:21.324
You're the Stare Master!

19:21.673 --> 19:24.924
We're sorry we snuck out of
the house and into the forest.

19:24.925 --> 19:27.475
Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on.

19:27.476 --> 19:28.891
We promise.

19:28.892 --> 19:32.898
Oh, you do, do you?
Well, you better or I'll give you...

19:32.899 --> 19:34.431
...the Stare!

19:42.605 --> 19:46.254
What... What happened?

19:51.679 --> 19:54.293
And that's when it brought
you back from stone.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.758
This is gonna make quite
a letter to the Princess.

19:57.759 --> 19:59.319
I was wrong about you.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.028
You certainly do know
how to handle those girls.

20:02.305 --> 20:03.761
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

20:03.762 --> 20:05.628
Hmm? How so?

20:05.678 --> 20:08.957
I assumed that I'd be just as good
with kids as I am with animals.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.825
Boy, was I wrong.

20:10.986 --> 20:14.521
I really learned the hard way not to
bite off more than I could chew.

20:14.522 --> 20:16.078
You and Rarity both.

20:16.379 --> 20:17.759
Good morning, Rarity!

20:17.760 --> 20:20.044
Did you finish all those capes?

20:20.520 --> 20:21.803
Just delivered them.

20:21.804 --> 20:26.006
I have to admit. If you hadn't
come along, I might not have.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.344
Thanks again.

20:28.003 --> 20:29.650
Won't you stay for some tea?

20:29.651 --> 20:32.329
I really must get back
to the shop and clean up.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.615
Girls, get your things. Time to go.

20:35.821 --> 20:36.553
Girls!

20:37.173 --> 20:39.022
Girls! Time...

20:40.071 --> 20:42.114
Girls! Your things!

20:42.688 --> 20:43.834
Girls...!

20:44.077 --> 20:45.391
It's time to...

20:46.398 --> 20:47.537
GIRLS!

20:47.538 --> 20:48.629
Allow me.

20:49.723 --> 20:50.480
Girls.

20:53.159 --> 20:55.102
-Yes, Fluttershy?
-You called?

20:55.103 --> 20:58.216
Go and get your things.
Rarity is here to see you home.

20:58.217 --> 21:00.473
Of course, Fluttershy. Right away.

21:01.232 --> 21:04.237
Ho... How did you...
How did you do that?

21:06.205 --> 21:09.502
I guess I'm just as good
with kids as I am with animals.

21:13.887 --> 21:17.445
Uh... Speaking of which,
I could use your help with Opal.

21:17.446 --> 21:19.952
Of course. How about later today?

21:21.033 --> 21:22.913
How about... now?

21:29.666 --> 21:33.166
