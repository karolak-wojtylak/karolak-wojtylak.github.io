WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:02.517
No... nope...

00:02.632 --> 00:04.977
Thank you kindly, Twilight, for helping me out.

00:05.155 --> 00:08.845
I bet Big Macintosh I could get all these
Golden Delicious in the barn by lunchtime.

00:08.952 --> 00:14.023
If I win, he's gonna walk down Stirrup
Street in one of Granny's girdles, heh heh.

00:14.033 --> 00:15.783
No problem at all, Applejack.

00:16.013 --> 00:20.387
But I'm glad, the goal is lunchtime.
All this hard work is making me hungry.

00:20.438 --> 00:21.832
I know, right?

00:23.436 --> 00:27.561
Oh really, Spike? You've been lounging
on my back all morning while we worked.

00:27.620 --> 00:31.845
Exactly! You two were taking
so long, I missed snacktime.

00:35.647 --> 00:37.727
I guess be better get some food.

00:37.754 --> 00:39.373
Nope... worm...

00:40.408 --> 00:41.391
Aha!

00:41.740 --> 00:44.307
Oh, Spike! That looks delicious...!

00:46.061 --> 00:47.313
Spike!

00:48.081 --> 00:48.999
What?

00:55.736 --> 00:57.739
It's a letter from Princess Celestia!

00:59.454 --> 01:00.998
Hear ye, hear ye.

01:01.138 --> 01:04.592
Her Grand Royal Highness
Princess Celestia of Equestria...

01:04.673 --> 01:07.029
...is pleased to announce
the Grand Galloping Gala...

01:07.181 --> 01:11.777
...to be held in the magnificent capital
city of Canterlot on the 21st day of...

01:12.279 --> 01:13.261
...yadda yadda yadda...

01:13.525 --> 01:17.809
...cordially extends an invitation
to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest.

01:19.132 --> 01:21.160
The Grand Galloping Gala!

01:57.713 --> 01:59.688
The Grand Galloping Gala!

02:07.272 --> 02:08.941
Look! Two tickets!

02:09.055 --> 02:12.456
Wow, great! I've never been to the Gala.
Have you, Spike?

02:12.713 --> 02:17.949
No and I plan to keep it that way. I don't
want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense.

02:18.163 --> 02:21.047
Oh, come on Spike! A dance would be nice.

02:21.157 --> 02:24.413
Nice?! It's a hiccup more than just nice!

02:24.449 --> 02:26.060
I'd love to go.

02:26.308 --> 02:29.964
Land sakes! If I had an apple stand set up...

02:29.965 --> 02:33.494
...ponies would be chewin' our tasty
vittles till the cows came home.

02:33.830 --> 02:37.763
Do you have any idea how much business
I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres?

02:37.988 --> 02:42.015
Why, with all that money we could
do a heap of fixin' up round here.

02:42.139 --> 02:44.239
We could replace that saggy old roof.

02:45.230 --> 02:48.194
And Big Macintosh could
replace that saggy old plow.

02:49.506 --> 02:53.006
And Granny Smith could
replace that saggy old hip!

02:56.303 --> 03:00.137
Wow. I'd give my left hind
leg to go to that Gala.

03:00.140 --> 03:02.894
Oh. Well, in that case, would you like to...

03:05.562 --> 03:08.966
Are we talking about the Grand Galloping Gala?

03:09.036 --> 03:13.729
Rainbow Dash. You told me you were
too busy to help me harvest apples.

03:13.930 --> 03:16.522
What were you busy doin'? Spyin'?

03:16.641 --> 03:18.250
No. I was busy...

03:18.925 --> 03:19.756
...napping.

03:20.155 --> 03:24.131
And I just happened to hear
that you have an extra ticket?

03:24.196 --> 03:27.252
-Yeah, but...
-Yes! This is so awesome!

03:27.634 --> 03:33.239
The Wonderbolts perform at the Grand Galloping
Gala every year. I can see it now...

03:34.226 --> 03:38.815
Everyone will be watching the sky.
Their eyes riveted on the Wonderbolts.

03:39.267 --> 03:41.395
But then, in would fly...

03:42.164 --> 03:43.564
Rainbow Dash!

03:45.643 --> 03:48.825
I would draw their attention
with my Super Speed Strut.

03:52.647 --> 03:57.065
Then I would mesmerize them
with my Fantastic Filly Flash.

04:00.215 --> 04:04.863
And for my grand finale the Buccaneer Blaze!

04:08.800 --> 04:11.140
The ponies would go wild!

04:12.054 --> 04:16.650
The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature
moves be incorporated into their routine.

04:16.706 --> 04:20.930
And then welcome me as their newest member.

04:26.724 --> 04:31.724
Don't you see, Twilight? This could be
my one chance to show 'em my stuff.

04:31.959 --> 04:33.533
You gotta take me!

04:33.882 --> 04:36.455
Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here.

04:37.566 --> 04:39.516
I asked for that ticket first.

04:39.599 --> 04:41.996
So? That doesn't mean you own it.

04:42.094 --> 04:47.304
Oh yeah? Well, I challenge you to
a hoof wrestle. Winner gets the ticket.

04:50.345 --> 04:54.707
Girls! These are MY tickets!
I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much.

04:54.727 --> 04:58.251
Whoever has the best reason to go,
should get the ticket, don't you think?

04:58.782 --> 05:03.413
-Drummin' up business for the farm?
-A chance to audition for the Wonderbolts?

05:03.428 --> 05:06.843
-Money to fix Granny's hip!
-Living the dream!

05:07.592 --> 05:10.438
Oh my! Those are all pretty
good reasons, aren't they?

05:13.945 --> 05:16.476
Listen to that. I am starving.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.688
I don't know about you, but I can't make
important decisions on an empty stomach.

05:19.952 --> 05:24.748
So I'll think about it over lunch
and get back to you two. Okay?

05:25.546 --> 05:26.705
Okay.

05:34.742 --> 05:36.877
So who you're gonna give the ticket to, Twilight?

05:37.018 --> 05:40.633
I don't know, Spike. But I really
can't think straight when I'm hungry.

05:40.669 --> 05:41.956
So where should we eat?

05:49.722 --> 05:52.528
Bats! Bats on my face! HELP!

05:52.562 --> 05:53.933
Wait! These aren't...!

05:54.816 --> 05:57.223
Tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala?!

05:58.573 --> 06:03.080
It's the most amazing incredible tremendous
super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous
party in all of Equestria!

06:03.147 --> 06:05.449
I've always always ALWAYS wanted to go!

06:05.567 --> 06:08.630
<i>Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!</i>

06:08.665 --> 06:11.919
<i>Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!</i>

06:12.067 --> 06:15.176
<i>Hip hip hurray,
it's the best place for me!</i>

06:15.360 --> 06:17.809
<i>For Pinkie!</i>

06:17.855 --> 06:22.135
With decorations and streamers and fairy lights
and pinwheels and piÃ±atas and pincushions...

06:22.210 --> 06:26.416
With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes
and sundaes and sunbeams and sasparilla!

06:26.481 --> 06:31.242
And I get to play my favoritest of favorite
fantabulous games like pin the tail on the pony!

06:31.768 --> 06:34.801
<i>Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!</i>

06:35.029 --> 06:38.063
<i>Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!</i>

06:38.141 --> 06:43.740
<i>Cause it's the most gallerific
superly-teriffic gala ever in the whole Galaxy!</i>

06:44.099 --> 06:45.287
Whee!

06:46.290 --> 06:49.846
Oh thank you, Twilight!
It's the most wonderfulest gift ever!

06:51.333 --> 06:52.837
Um... Actually...

06:55.778 --> 06:57.889
Are these what I think they are?

06:58.524 --> 07:02.922
Yes, yes, YES! Twilight's taking my to
the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!

07:03.432 --> 07:04.330
The Gala!

07:04.597 --> 07:10.165
I design ensembles for the Gala every year,
but I've never had the opportunity to attend.

07:10.444 --> 07:15.461
Oh, the society, the culture, the glamor!
It's where I truly belong.

07:15.779 --> 07:18.433
And where I'm destined to meet... HIM!

07:18.753 --> 07:19.742
Him...!

07:20.975 --> 07:21.589
Who?

07:21.663 --> 07:22.651
Him.

07:24.285 --> 07:27.859
I would stroll through the Gala
and everyone would wonder...

07:28.625 --> 07:30.711
"Who is that mysterious mare?"

07:32.141 --> 07:36.545
They would never guess that I was just
a simple pony from little old Ponyville.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.335
Why, I would cause such a sensation...

07:40.489 --> 07:44.229
...that I would be invited for an
audience with Princess Celestia herself!

07:44.497 --> 07:47.962
And the Princess would be so taken
with the style and elegance...

07:48.223 --> 07:52.567
...that she would introduce me to HIM!
Her nephew!

07:53.230 --> 07:56.671
The most handsome, eligible
unicorn stallion in Canterlot!

07:57.485 --> 08:00.285
Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt...

08:00.706 --> 08:03.602
Our courtship would be magnificent.

08:04.056 --> 08:06.926
He would ask for my hoof in marriage
and of course I would say...

08:07.154 --> 08:08.032
YES!!!

08:08.818 --> 08:11.503
We would have a royal wedding,
befitting a princess...

08:11.594 --> 08:15.176
...which is what I would
become upon marrying him.

08:15.421 --> 08:17.521
The stallion of my dreams.

08:20.917 --> 08:25.956
Twilight! I simply cannot believe you would
invite Pinkie Pie, so she could party...

08:26.115 --> 08:30.694
...and prevent me from meeting my true love!
How could you?!

08:33.389 --> 08:34.330
Hey!

08:37.716 --> 08:40.342
Angel! These are perfect!

08:41.444 --> 08:45.453
Listen guys, I haven't decided
who to give the extra ticket to.

08:45.562 --> 08:46.422
You haven't?!

08:46.868 --> 08:48.908
Um... Excuse me...

08:48.999 --> 08:53.153
Twilight, I would just like to ask...
I mean, if it would be all right...

08:53.453 --> 08:55.332
...if you haven't given it to someone else...

08:55.457 --> 08:58.747
You?! You want to go to the Gala?

08:58.992 --> 09:00.402
Oh... no.

09:02.239 --> 09:06.749
I mean... yes. Or actually, kind of. You see...

09:07.568 --> 09:09.997
It's not so much the Grand Galloping Gala...

09:10.197 --> 09:14.400
...as it is the wondrous private gated
garden that surrounds the dance.

09:14.460 --> 09:19.411
The flowers are said the be the most
beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria!

09:19.559 --> 09:24.007
For the night of the Gala and that night
alone will they all be in bloom.

09:24.389 --> 09:28.042
And that's just the flora!
Don't get me started on the fauna.

09:28.821 --> 09:31.318
There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my!

09:31.487 --> 09:33.266
Hummingbirds that can really hum!

09:33.396 --> 09:35.496
And buzzards that can really buzz!

09:35.803 --> 09:41.143
And blue jays and red jays and green
jays, pink jays and pink flamingos.

09:43.710 --> 09:47.127
Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful.

09:47.139 --> 09:49.852
-Wait just a minute!
-Rainbow Dash!

09:49.993 --> 09:51.326
Were you following me?

09:51.513 --> 09:55.199
No... I mean, yes... I mean, maybe.
Look, it doesn't matter!

09:55.221 --> 09:59.165
I couldn't risk a goody four-shoes like you
giving that ticket away to just anybody.

09:59.244 --> 10:03.653
-Wait just another minute!
-Applejack! Were you following me too?

10:03.966 --> 10:09.391
No. I was following this one to make
sure she didn't try any funny business.

10:09.717 --> 10:12.658
-Still tryin' to take my ticket.
-YOUR ticket?!

10:12.758 --> 10:14.336
But Twilight's taking me!

10:25.983 --> 10:28.265
QUIET!

10:28.266 --> 10:32.618
...and then I said "Oatmeal? Are you craz..." Oh.

10:33.013 --> 10:35.206
Girls! There's no use in arguing!

10:35.360 --> 10:36.713
But Twilight...!

10:36.948 --> 10:40.141
This is my decision and I'm
gonna make it on my own...

10:40.201 --> 10:42.599
...and I certainly can't think
straight with all this noise!

10:43.618 --> 10:45.180
Not to mention hunger.

10:45.323 --> 10:46.887
Now go on! Shoo!

10:51.025 --> 10:53.478
And don't worry, I'll figure this out!

10:55.267 --> 10:56.305
Somehow.

10:59.813 --> 11:01.923
Oh Spike. What am I gonna do?

11:02.386 --> 11:06.030
All five of my best friends have
really good reasons to go to the Gala.

11:06.322 --> 11:11.413
Applejack, Rainbow Dash,
Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy, Rarity...

11:11.587 --> 11:13.570
Oh, who should go with me?

11:16.582 --> 11:18.229
Have you made your decision?

11:18.617 --> 11:19.838
I CAN'T DECIDE!

11:20.142 --> 11:22.448
Twilight, he just wants to take your order.

11:23.077 --> 11:26.389
Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.

11:26.557 --> 11:27.814
Do you have any rubies?

11:28.692 --> 11:32.926
No? Okay, I'll have the hay fries. Extra crispy.

11:33.222 --> 11:34.463
What do you think, Spike?

11:34.773 --> 11:36.608
I think we have to try another restaurant.

11:36.836 --> 11:40.869
I mean, I like grass just fine, but would
it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?

11:40.991 --> 11:43.974
I mean about the Gala
and the ticket and who I should take!

11:44.074 --> 11:47.457
-Oh, you're still on THAT?
-Spike, listen!

11:47.566 --> 11:51.326
How do I choose? And when I do choose,
will the other four be mad at me?

11:51.426 --> 11:53.962
I mean, I could give up
my ticket and give away two...

11:54.056 --> 11:56.951
...but that would still leave three
disappointed ponies. What if I...

11:57.047 --> 11:58.240
Ah, your food.

11:58.405 --> 12:03.660
Oh, thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure
everything will be much clearer once I eat.

12:06.550 --> 12:10.875
Um, Madame? Are you going to
eat your food in ze rain?

12:11.051 --> 12:12.284
It's not raining.

12:15.226 --> 12:16.507
What's going on?

12:16.800 --> 12:20.698
Hi there, best friend forever I've ever ever had?
Enjoying the sunny weather?

12:20.939 --> 12:23.335
Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?

12:23.522 --> 12:27.882
Whadya mean? I just saw the smartest,
most generous pony about to get rained on...

12:27.883 --> 12:30.432
...so I though I'd kick a hole
in the clouds to keep her dry...

12:30.433 --> 12:32.657
...so she can dine at peace. That's all.

12:32.818 --> 12:36.682
Rainbow. You're not trying to get extra
consideration for the extra ticket...

12:36.683 --> 12:39.794
...by doing the extra special favors, are you?

12:39.940 --> 12:43.300
Me? No no no, of course not!

12:44.407 --> 12:47.283
Seriously, I'd do it for anypony.

12:52.579 --> 12:55.731
Rainbow, I am not comfortable
accepting unwanted favors.

12:55.803 --> 12:58.590
So I'd appreciate if you closed up
that rain cloud right now.

12:59.666 --> 13:00.725
Fine.

13:02.143 --> 13:03.504
That's better.

13:10.476 --> 13:14.722
-Twilight! It's raining.
-No. Really?

13:14.946 --> 13:16.971
Come with me before you catch a cold!

13:23.238 --> 13:25.003
Oops. Sorry.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.707
Oh no! It's quite all right.

13:28.794 --> 13:33.129
After all, we are THE BEST OF FRIENDS,
are we not?

13:33.491 --> 13:36.320
And you know what the best of friends do?

13:37.367 --> 13:38.885
Makeover!

13:39.957 --> 13:41.180
Ugh... Rarity...

13:49.185 --> 13:52.034
There! Oh, you're simply darling!

13:53.178 --> 13:55.426
Yeah... It is kinda pretty, isn't it?

13:56.319 --> 14:01.633
And you! Oh, Spike. I have a dandy
little outfit for the dashing gent.

14:08.904 --> 14:11.537
-Oh, Spike.
-Now you just need a hat!

14:12.308 --> 14:16.358
I told you! I don't want any part of this girly
gala gunk. See you back at the library!

14:17.639 --> 14:21.470
Oh, who needs him anyway?
This is all about you!

14:21.539 --> 14:24.902
And how fabulous you'll look
at the Grand Galloping Gala.

14:25.058 --> 14:27.177
Wait. The Grand...

14:27.416 --> 14:30.655
And, oh my goodness, what a coincidence!

14:30.742 --> 14:34.978
I happen to have an ensemble
of my own that matches yours to a tee.

14:35.324 --> 14:40.051
We would be the belles of the ball, you and I.
Everyone would be clamoring for our attention.

14:40.123 --> 14:44.182
All eyes would be on us. And then everyone
would finally know, the most beautiful...

14:44.183 --> 14:47.200
...most talented, most sophisticated
pony in all of Equestria...

14:47.201 --> 14:49.780
...is Rarity the Unicorn!

14:53.406 --> 14:55.093
And Twilight Sparkle, of course.

14:56.407 --> 15:00.117
I see what's going on. You're just
buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket.

15:00.177 --> 15:01.645
Well, it's not gonna work!

15:01.648 --> 15:04.585
You're going to have to wait for my
decision just like everyone else.

15:04.588 --> 15:08.533
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been
trying all day just to get some lunch!

15:08.572 --> 15:10.756
Did somepony say lunch?

15:12.840 --> 15:14.966
You've got to be kidding me!

15:15.153 --> 15:20.037
I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts,
apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumbles...

15:20.040 --> 15:22.782
...aaand apple Brown Betty!

15:23.118 --> 15:25.296
The dessert. Not my auntie.

15:25.617 --> 15:27.701
What'd ya say there, best friend?

15:29.289 --> 15:30.581
Is that a yes?

15:32.133 --> 15:33.503
No! NO!

15:33.678 --> 15:35.582
I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to!

15:35.777 --> 15:38.417
And all these favors aren't
making it any easier to decide.

15:38.651 --> 15:42.929
In fact, I'm less sure now
than I was this morning! Aaargh!

15:43.330 --> 15:44.828
So... that's a maybe?

15:48.538 --> 15:51.751
I never thought being showered with
favors would be so aggravating.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.457
Fluttershy! Not you too...

16:01.629 --> 16:03.679
Oh! Well, hello, Twilight.

16:03.831 --> 16:07.816
I hope you don't mind but we're all
doing a little spring cleaning for you.

16:07.826 --> 16:08.865
It's summer.

16:09.155 --> 16:12.247
Oh. Well... better late than never, right?

16:12.559 --> 16:14.499
It was Angel's idea.

16:16.947 --> 16:19.318
You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?

16:19.401 --> 16:25.459
Oh, no! I'm doing this because you're
my very best friend! Right, Angel?

16:27.624 --> 16:30.307
Yes. We are just doing this for the ticket.

16:32.608 --> 16:34.116
No no NO!

16:34.270 --> 16:36.405
Well, this is all very nice of you and Angel...

16:36.406 --> 16:39.588
...but I'm not accepting any extra favors
until I've made my final decision.

16:39.669 --> 16:41.409
So I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.334
SURPRISE!

16:44.683 --> 16:47.410
<i>Twilight is my bestest friend, whoopee! Whoopee!</i>
-Pinkie...

16:47.501 --> 16:50.584
<i>She's the cutest, smartest, all-around best pony! Pony!</i>
-Pinkie...!

16:50.907 --> 16:53.756
<i>I bet if I throw a super-duper fun party! Party!</i>
-Pinkie!

16:53.961 --> 16:59.078
<i>She'll give her extra ticket to the Gala to meee!</i>
-PINKIEEE!!!

17:01.156 --> 17:02.611
Yes, Twilight?

17:03.914 --> 17:07.243
At least the other ponies *try*
to be subtle about the ticket!

17:07.488 --> 17:10.766
-Wait... What ticket? What gala?
-Oh, you didn't know?

17:10.842 --> 17:13.454
Twilight has an extra ticket
to the Grand Galloping Gala!

17:13.627 --> 17:16.278
THE GRAND GALLOPING GALA?!

17:16.304 --> 17:18.454
Have I ever told you how much
I love your mane?

17:18.552 --> 17:19.612
I'll wash your dishes!

17:19.801 --> 17:23.930
-Would you like any help with your gardening?
-I have a cartload of extra carrots.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.160
What are we gonna do?

17:27.768 --> 17:32.093
We're... gonna... RUUUUN!!!

18:19.813 --> 18:22.614
Warn me next time you're gonna do that.

18:22.691 --> 18:25.953
I didn't even know it was gonna happen!
Not quick, lock the doors!

18:36.278 --> 18:38.199
I can't decide, I just can't decide!

18:38.582 --> 18:41.532
It's important to all of you and I just
can't stand to disappoint any of you...

18:41.632 --> 18:44.019
...and giving me gifts and doing me
favors won't make any difference.

18:44.151 --> 18:49.333
Because you're all my friends and I wanna
make you all happy and I can't! I JUST CAN'T!

18:49.352 --> 18:53.053
Twilight, sugar... I didn't mean to
put so much pressure on you.

18:53.558 --> 18:58.310
And if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore.
You can give it to somepony else.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.415
I won't feel bad, I promise.

19:00.471 --> 19:05.087
Me too. I feel just awful
that I made you feel so awful.

19:05.165 --> 19:08.284
And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends!

19:08.541 --> 19:11.863
Twilight, it was unfair of me
to try to force you as I did.

19:11.960 --> 19:15.417
YES! That means, the ticket is mine!

19:16.094 --> 19:19.019
I've got the ticket, I've got the ticket...

19:21.708 --> 19:26.512
You know... I haven't perfected my signature
moves for the Wonderbolts anyway.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.732
I don't need that ticket either.

19:28.819 --> 19:31.499
We all got so gung-ho about
going to the Gala...

19:31.690 --> 19:34.735
...that we couldn't see how
ungung-ho we were makin' you.

19:35.271 --> 19:37.100
We're sorry, Twilight!

19:37.279 --> 19:39.264
Spike, take down a note.

19:39.764 --> 19:44.694
Dear Princess Celestia. I've learned that one of
the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings.

19:45.020 --> 19:47.171
But when it's not enough
blessings to go around...

19:47.232 --> 19:50.195
...having more than your friends
can make you feel pretty awful.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.906
So, though I appreciate the invitation...

19:52.996 --> 19:56.054
...I will be returning both tickets
to the Grand Galloping Gala.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.005
WHAT?!

19:57.104 --> 20:00.540
If my friends can't all go,
I don't wanna go either.

20:01.774 --> 20:04.228
Twilight, you don't have to do that!

20:04.337 --> 20:07.950
Nope, I've made up my mind.
Spike, you can send the letter now.

20:11.025 --> 20:13.733
Now you won't get to go to the Gala either.

20:13.740 --> 20:18.384
It's okay, girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy
myself without my best friends there with me.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.943
So I'd rather not go at all.

20:24.860 --> 20:30.734
Well, wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like
a boy. Can't handle the least bit of sentiment.

20:31.381 --> 20:32.363
Whoah, Nelly!

20:33.787 --> 20:36.502
A letter from the Princess? That was fast!

20:36.903 --> 20:41.703
My faithful student Twilight.
Why didn't you just say so in the first place?

20:42.713 --> 20:45.343
Six tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala!

20:46.392 --> 20:48.021
Now we can all go!

20:54.009 --> 20:56.030
Allow us to treat you to dinner.

20:56.521 --> 20:58.474
What a great way to apologise!

20:58.484 --> 21:03.252
And to celebrate! Come on, everyone!
The cupcakes are on me.

21:05.969 --> 21:08.559
How come I don't get a ticket to the Gala?

21:11.896 --> 21:13.470
And one for you, Spike.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.783
I mean... gross! I have to go too?

21:30.496 --> 21:33.996
