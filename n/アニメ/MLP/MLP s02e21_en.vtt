00:04.839 --> 00:07.489
C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!

00:07.640 --> 00:09.679
There's nothing fun about dragons!

00:09.830 --> 00:12.639
Scary, yes.
Fun, no!

00:12.790 --> 00:16.989
Fluttershy, the great dragon migration
happens only once in a generation.

00:17.140 --> 00:19.485
Do you really wanna pass up
a chance like that?

00:19.789 --> 00:21.489
Now that you put it that way,

00:21.719 --> 00:22.689
yes!

00:23.439 --> 00:26.099
Aw Fluttershy,
we just don't want you to miss out.

00:26.250 --> 00:28.139
Miss out on what? Dragons?

00:28.290 --> 00:31.589
Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?

00:31.740 --> 00:33.139
Well... yeah!

00:33.290 --> 00:35.259
Thanks, but... no thanks!

00:36.010 --> 00:40.689
Look, Fluttershy, I watched that
boring butterfly migration with you,

00:40.840 --> 00:43.839
so now it's your turn to watch
the dragon migration with me!

00:43.990 --> 00:44.899
You owe me!

00:45.050 --> 00:47.301
I said... no!

00:57.219 --> 00:59.989
Okay, I guess
I'll let you off the hook this time.

01:40.854 --> 01:42.456
I don't see any dragons.

01:42.607 --> 01:43.607
Me neither.

01:43.758 --> 01:45.158
Me neither neither.

01:45.556 --> 01:46.609
Shoot!

01:46.760 --> 01:48.206
You don't think we missed them, do you?

01:48.357 --> 01:50.056
No, I don't think so.

01:50.207 --> 01:52.437
We're just a little early,
and I'm glad we are.

01:52.588 --> 01:54.776
This way, we can watch
every moment of the migration

01:54.927 --> 01:57.416
without bringing any unwanted
attention to ourselves!

01:57.567 --> 01:58.967
Yoo-hoo!

01:59.518 --> 02:00.518
Well?

02:01.269 --> 02:04.876
What do you think?
Am I the toast of the trench or what?

02:05.327 --> 02:06.556
You'll be toast alright!

02:06.707 --> 02:08.836
When the dragons see you
parading around in that getup...

02:09.306 --> 02:10.806
You look very nice, Rarity.

02:10.957 --> 02:13.680
But could you maybe look nice
down here in the trench with us?

02:13.931 --> 02:17.956
Nice is an understatement.
I look fabulous!

02:18.107 --> 02:20.198
Who says camouflage has to be drab?

02:20.349 --> 02:21.349
Ahoy, maties!

02:21.500 --> 02:23.238
Dragons ho!

02:32.016 --> 02:33.401
Amazing!

02:35.756 --> 02:38.216
Pretty lame move.
Is that all they've got?

02:42.456 --> 02:44.998
What do ya think of that move,
Rainbow Dash?

02:45.149 --> 02:46.149
Still think they're lame?

02:46.300 --> 02:48.047
Uh, not so much.

02:48.198 --> 02:50.356
The word 'fierce' comes to mind.

02:50.507 --> 02:52.086
And 'formidable'.

02:52.237 --> 02:54.321
And 'super-duper scary'!

02:54.472 --> 02:55.372
Yeah.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.154
Us dragons are definitely
a force to be reckoned with.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.927
Yeah, right, Spike.

03:03.078 --> 03:07.075
That's one of the scariest aprons
I've ever seen!

03:08.443 --> 03:10.431
What's wrong with wearing an apron?

03:10.582 --> 03:13.682
You won't be laughing when you spill
blueberries all over your scales.

03:13.833 --> 03:15.878
Feathers. That's one tough stain!

03:16.029 --> 03:19.596
One tough stain against one lame dragon!

03:21.627 --> 03:24.207
You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash!

03:24.358 --> 03:25.406
Spike's style is unique.

03:25.557 --> 03:27.485
He doesn't have
to look like other dragons.

03:27.636 --> 03:28.636
Or act like them.

03:28.787 --> 03:32.029
My little Spikey-wikey
is perfect the way he is.

03:32.180 --> 03:34.476
I don't act like other dragons?

03:34.627 --> 03:36.450
Oh, not even close!

03:36.601 --> 03:38.081
But why would you want to, Spike?

03:38.232 --> 03:42.616
Yes, you've got something those dreadfully
fierce dragons can only dream of.

03:42.767 --> 03:43.767
What's that?

03:43.918 --> 03:46.432
The cutest widdle chubby cheeks!

03:47.283 --> 03:50.436
Cute?! Dragons aren't
supposed to be cute!

03:50.587 --> 03:51.587
Right?

03:51.738 --> 03:54.520
Oh, sweetie, you are turning
the most delightful shade of red...

03:54.671 --> 03:56.106
It it is most becoming.

04:01.720 --> 04:05.126
Oh, isn't he adorable
when he waddles off in anger?

04:05.277 --> 04:07.810
Waddle?! Arrrgggh!

04:10.356 --> 04:12.222
What am I?

04:12.373 --> 04:14.373
Where am I from?

04:14.556 --> 04:16.895
Who am I supposed to be?

04:17.546 --> 04:19.309
I don't know!

04:19.460 --> 04:22.808
For the last time, Spike,
you were given to me as an egg.

04:22.959 --> 04:26.342
I don't know who found you,
or where they found you.

04:26.493 --> 04:29.236
Seriously? That's all you know?

04:29.387 --> 04:30.687
I'm sorry, Spike.

04:30.838 --> 04:34.020
That doesn't tell me anything
about who I am!

04:34.171 --> 04:36.572
I need answers!
I feel like I'm...

04:36.723 --> 04:39.707
I'm looking at a complete stranger.

04:41.917 --> 04:43.306
Oh, Spike.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.604
Why don't we do
some late-night research?

04:45.755 --> 04:47.045
See what we can find out.

04:47.196 --> 04:48.896
Really? You'd do that?

04:49.047 --> 04:52.337
Of course!
I'm sure we can find something.

04:55.556 --> 04:56.614
Nothing.

04:57.501 --> 04:59.195
Nothing in this one either!

04:59.346 --> 05:00.845
Nothing at all about dragons?

05:00.996 --> 05:02.596
This is getting ridiculous!

05:02.747 --> 05:07.100
I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies
know next to nothing about dragons.

05:07.251 --> 05:10.856
Apparently they're too rare and too scary
to try to talk to us or study!

05:11.806 --> 05:14.810
I wonder if dragons cry...

05:14.961 --> 05:16.161
Aw, Spike.

05:17.712 --> 05:18.846
It's okay, Twilight.

05:18.997 --> 05:22.467
I'm gonna discover who I am
if it's the last thing I do!

05:22.618 --> 05:23.618
Hey guys!

05:24.069 --> 05:25.469
Good morning!

05:25.620 --> 05:27.020
Ya wanna join us for breakfast?

05:27.171 --> 05:30.037
That sounds great.
I'm famished.

05:30.188 --> 05:32.574
Count me out.
I've gotta get an early start!

05:33.025 --> 05:34.384
An early start?

05:34.735 --> 05:37.984
Yes! I'm going on
a quest of self-discovery!

05:38.135 --> 05:40.171
I need to learn what it means
to be a dragon!

05:40.322 --> 05:44.611
And the only way I'm gonna do that
is to join the dragon migration!

05:44.762 --> 05:46.062
What?!?

05:46.813 --> 05:49.138
Spike, that's nonsense talk!

05:49.289 --> 05:50.474
I know that you're a dragon,

05:50.625 --> 05:52.701
but those dragons mean business!

05:52.852 --> 05:54.856
They're big, and tough, and scary...

05:55.007 --> 05:59.295
And I'm small, and meek...
and I like to wear aprons. See?

05:59.446 --> 06:01.360
This is exactly why I need
to spend time with them.

06:01.511 --> 06:03.478
All I'm saying is that
you could get hurt.

06:03.629 --> 06:07.156
Darling, this time I really do have
to agree with Rainbow Dash.

06:07.307 --> 06:10.827
I don't want those big, ugly,
nasty dragons to hurt one little scale

06:10.978 --> 06:12.886
on your cutsey-wutsey head!

06:13.037 --> 06:15.358
I'm sorry,
but I've made up my mind.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.923
Quick, do something!
Stop him before it's too late!

06:21.436 --> 06:23.188
Hey!
Give it back!

06:24.106 --> 06:25.139
Hold it!

06:31.006 --> 06:31.963
Really?

06:32.114 --> 06:33.816
Don't tell me you think he should go!

06:33.967 --> 06:37.180
Yes, Spike. I couldn't
answer your questions.

06:37.331 --> 06:38.831
My books couldn't either.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.410
I understand why you want
to look elsewhere.

06:41.561 --> 06:44.311
I truly believe you need
to go on this quest.

06:44.462 --> 06:46.706
And we have no right to stop you.

06:46.857 --> 06:48.659
I suppose not.

06:48.810 --> 06:53.309
I still say you're nutty, but hey,
I've done lots of nutty things.

06:53.460 --> 06:54.506
We know.

06:55.956 --> 06:59.093
Well then,
I guess this is goodbye, Spike.

06:59.394 --> 07:02.356
We can't wait to hear about it,
when you return.

07:02.507 --> 07:04.099
Yeah, we hope your trip-

07:04.250 --> 07:04.950
Quest.

07:05.101 --> 07:08.799
-your quest answers some of
your pesky "who am I" questions.

07:08.950 --> 07:11.006
Thanks, everypony. I know it will.

07:11.707 --> 07:14.034
Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!

07:14.185 --> 07:15.878
Go get 'em, big guy!

07:16.029 --> 07:17.229
We have faith in you!

07:18.280 --> 07:21.428
- We're following him, right?
- Of course.

08:20.981 --> 08:23.079
Alright,
teenage dragons!

08:23.230 --> 08:25.969
Now that's more my speed. And size.

08:28.956 --> 08:31.799
I'm telling you,
we'll never pass for a real dragon!

08:31.950 --> 08:35.022
Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous.

08:35.173 --> 08:36.873
One of my finer creations.

08:37.324 --> 08:40.722
We'll never pass if they hear
three voices coming out of one dragon!

08:40.873 --> 08:42.858
Now come on,
let's go!

08:46.479 --> 08:48.037
Um, excuse me?

08:48.638 --> 08:50.838
Um, hi.
I'm Spike.

08:52.649 --> 08:56.458
You sure your name
is Spike and not Shrimp?!

08:58.196 --> 09:02.549
No, it's Spike! I'm not,
I mean, I'm sure about that...

09:02.700 --> 09:05.019
You look more like Peewee to me.

09:06.070 --> 09:08.318
Hey guys, come on, seriously.

09:08.469 --> 09:10.555
Leave him alone, or he might fly away.

09:10.706 --> 09:13.445
That is, uh, if he had any wings!

09:18.055 --> 09:21.581
You fly in on your mommy's back
during the migration?

09:21.732 --> 09:22.832
Not exactly...

09:22.983 --> 09:26.152
No, no, can't you see
baby Spike just hatched?

09:26.303 --> 09:28.398
I bet he still sucks his claw at night!

09:28.549 --> 09:30.579
No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!

09:32.693 --> 09:34.190
Well if you weren't just hatched,

09:34.341 --> 09:36.352
how come we haven't seen
you around before?

09:36.503 --> 09:38.759
Well, y'see, I live in Ponyville and-

09:39.620 --> 09:41.739
Ponyville? That explains it!

09:41.890 --> 09:44.113
I knew there was something
vaguely pony-ish about you!

09:44.264 --> 09:47.716
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were part pony!

09:47.867 --> 09:49.878
Who, me? I'm not part pony!

09:50.029 --> 09:51.567
I'm all dragon, see?

09:53.692 --> 09:57.210
Or maybe you're a pony
in a dragon costume.

09:59.889 --> 10:02.464
A pony in a dragon costume!

10:03.215 --> 10:06.443
Ahah... yeah... hilarious...

10:07.032 --> 10:08.786
I am a real dragon!

10:08.937 --> 10:10.573
Oh yeah? Prove it.

10:10.724 --> 10:13.399
- Well... how?
- By acting like one!

10:13.550 --> 10:15.968
Who's up for a little belching contest?!

10:37.849 --> 10:39.898
You think you can beat that, Peewee?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.415
From the desk of Princess Celestia...

10:50.566 --> 10:52.576
Dear Spike, please... Ha!

10:52.727 --> 10:57.677
Get this, guys! Spike's penpals with
a namby-pamby pony princess!

11:03.727 --> 11:05.479
How can he just throw that away?!

11:05.630 --> 11:07.693
That letter could be something important!

11:07.844 --> 11:11.351
We can't worry about that now,
Twilight, we're here to help Spike!

11:11.502 --> 11:13.002
I know, I know!

11:13.418 --> 11:16.075
There's no reason to disrespect
Princess Celestia that way!

11:16.226 --> 11:18.564
Maybe tail wrestling is more your speed.

11:21.482 --> 11:23.994
Ready... go!

11:31.542 --> 11:33.821
The winner!

11:37.050 --> 11:38.857
Good old tail wrestling...

11:39.008 --> 11:42.109
We can't let little Spikey-wikey
wrestle one of them!

11:42.260 --> 11:43.360
He'll get clobbered!

11:43.611 --> 11:44.511
Let's go!

11:44.962 --> 11:47.949
I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!

11:48.100 --> 11:49.400
Who's this weirdo?

11:49.551 --> 11:51.379
I think he's Crackle's cousin.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.039
That would explain it.

11:59.549 --> 12:01.239
Ready?
Go!

12:10.077 --> 12:12.200
Spike's the winner!

12:14.459 --> 12:18.152
Nice going, little Spike!
Maybe you are a dragon after all!

12:18.303 --> 12:21.021
Yeah! Maybe I am!

12:21.772 --> 12:25.254
Rainbow Dash, I can't believe
your silly plan actually worked.

12:26.799 --> 12:29.064
Alright, who's next?

12:29.215 --> 12:32.255
Getting a little cocky, huh?
I like that.

12:32.406 --> 12:35.210
So how about you wrestle... him!

12:39.975 --> 12:40.927
Go!

12:45.254 --> 12:50.150
So Spike, you haven't exactly proven
yourself as a dragon yet, have you?

12:50.301 --> 12:52.272
But... I get an A for effort?

12:52.423 --> 12:53.551
Huh, maybe.

12:53.702 --> 12:56.362
Let's see how you do
in this next contest.

13:01.794 --> 13:05.022
King of the hoard!

13:13.329 --> 13:14.751
This is my chance.

13:16.079 --> 13:17.456
Not so fast!

13:25.078 --> 13:27.368
King of the ho-whoa!

13:30.722 --> 13:34.092
Looks like this is another
fail for you, little Spike.

13:34.243 --> 13:37.349
Can't wait to watch you fail
at lava cannonball too.

13:43.649 --> 13:47.211
Whoever makes the biggest lava splash
is the ultimate dragon!

13:47.362 --> 13:49.099
Geronimo!

13:53.529 --> 13:55.349
Spike's on his own this time.

13:58.973 --> 14:01.265
Cannonball!

14:09.044 --> 14:10.399
What's wrong, Spike?

14:10.550 --> 14:14.266
You afraid the lava would hurt
your soft pony hide?

14:33.307 --> 14:35.899
Was I... that bad?

14:36.050 --> 14:38.384
No, dude, that was awesome!

14:38.535 --> 14:41.039
Nopony could live through
a belly flop like that!

14:41.659 --> 14:43.609
You're one tough little dragon.

14:55.051 --> 14:59.441
Spike, by belly flopping so hard,
you have proven yourself worthy.

14:59.592 --> 15:03.578
I hereby dub you 'rookie dragon'.

15:03.729 --> 15:06.195
And will now perform
the initiation ritual.

15:09.066 --> 15:12.399
Now let's party dragon style!

15:19.792 --> 15:22.120
Man, was that a great party.

15:22.271 --> 15:24.909
Great, huh?
Maybe by Ponyville standards.

15:25.060 --> 15:26.060
Stick with us, Spike.

15:26.211 --> 15:28.777
We still got plenty to teach you
about being a dragon.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.675
I'm not going anywhere.
The way I feel right now,

15:31.826 --> 15:34.696
I could hang out with you guys forever.

15:35.147 --> 15:36.547
Forever?!

15:41.386 --> 15:46.208
Spikey-wikey is going to stay
with these awful dragons? Forever?

15:46.359 --> 15:48.486
Oh no, this is terrible!

15:48.637 --> 15:51.445
I should've stopped him back
at the library when I had the chance!

15:51.596 --> 15:54.102
No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault!

15:54.263 --> 15:56.132
I encouraged him to go!

15:56.283 --> 16:00.137
Y'know, Spike, I think you just might
be ready for a real dragon raid.

16:02.737 --> 16:04.932
There's a nest full of phoenix eggs nearby,

16:05.083 --> 16:06.832
and we're gonna swipe 'em!

16:07.883 --> 16:10.656
Aren't you totally psyched
to go on this raid?

16:10.807 --> 16:12.847
Oh yeah, I'm excited.

16:12.998 --> 16:14.512
I mean, I'm psyched.

16:14.663 --> 16:17.181
Alright then. Let's fly!

16:20.959 --> 16:23.932
Sorry guys! Guess I'll meet you
back here at the crater!

16:24.083 --> 16:27.057
After the whole raid thing's over?
We'll totally hang then!

16:29.158 --> 16:32.660
Oh no, they took Spike!
We've gotta go after them!

16:37.732 --> 16:40.688
Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!

16:40.839 --> 16:43.113
And you're ruining my fabulous costume!

16:45.482 --> 16:47.735
I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!

16:47.886 --> 16:50.415
Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!

16:57.690 --> 17:00.241
Alright, Spike,
since you're a rookie dragon,

17:00.392 --> 17:03.182
you get to lure the parents
away from the nest.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.493
Huh... lucky me...

17:05.644 --> 17:07.300
Well go on, then!

17:08.762 --> 17:10.432
Hey Mr and Mrs Phoenix!

17:10.583 --> 17:12.723
I was hoping I could have a word with you?

17:14.979 --> 17:18.421
I'd like to ask you
some questions actually...

17:18.572 --> 17:20.338
We haven't got all day, Spike!

17:21.239 --> 17:25.012
Hey, you bird brains! Come and get me!

17:32.818 --> 17:33.750
What the...

17:34.832 --> 17:36.132
The eggs have hatched.

17:36.283 --> 17:37.583
What do we do now?

17:38.134 --> 17:41.232
We take the hatchlings, of course!

17:53.256 --> 17:54.032
Get 'em!

18:18.689 --> 18:20.122
Get them!

18:34.612 --> 18:36.945
They got away! I hate that!

18:42.532 --> 18:43.875
What have we got here?

18:46.882 --> 18:47.743
What happened?

18:47.894 --> 18:48.894
They got away!

18:50.213 --> 18:51.804
You stole an egg?

18:53.195 --> 18:56.182
I guess the raid wasn't
a total waste after all.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.330
Nice going, Spike.

19:00.581 --> 19:02.821
Well, what are you
waiting for, Spike?

19:02.972 --> 19:03.972
Smash it!

19:04.123 --> 19:06.469
- Smash the egg?
- Yeah!

19:06.620 --> 19:10.312
Yeah, throw it on the ground
as hard as you can!

19:11.505 --> 19:16.889
Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!
Smash it! Smash it!

19:24.818 --> 19:28.206
No! It's just a defenseless egg,
like I was!

19:28.357 --> 19:29.782
And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!

19:29.933 --> 19:32.360
- What did you say?
- I said, no!

19:32.511 --> 19:34.292
No one says no to me.

19:43.210 --> 19:45.397
Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!

19:45.548 --> 19:46.548
That's right!

19:46.699 --> 19:49.383
Fighting's not really my thing,
I'm more into fashion,

19:49.534 --> 19:53.582
but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch
one scale on his cute little head!

19:57.114 --> 19:58.859
Ooh, scary!

19:59.010 --> 20:02.510
Spike, are these namby-pamby ponies
your friends?

20:02.661 --> 20:06.632
Yes, they are. And they're better friends
than you could ever be.

20:06.783 --> 20:10.802
Now, if you don't back off,
you'll see what us ponies do

20:10.953 --> 20:14.532
when confronted by
a huge group of jerky dragons.

20:14.683 --> 20:18.021
Oh yeah?
What's that?

20:19.100 --> 20:21.570
Run away!

20:41.272 --> 20:43.662
That was a close one. Thanks you guys.

20:43.813 --> 20:46.532
Of course. What are friends for?

20:47.482 --> 20:51.482
You're more than friends.
You're my family.

20:54.262 --> 20:56.049
Dear Princess Celestia,

20:56.200 --> 21:00.526
seeing the great dragon migration made me
wonder what it meant to be a dragon.

21:00.677 --> 21:05.168
But now I realize that who I am
is not the same as what I am.

21:05.319 --> 21:09.092
I may have been born a dragon,
but Equestria and my pony friends

21:09.243 --> 21:12.850
have taught me how to be kind,
loyal, and true!

21:13.001 --> 21:17.955
I'm proud to call Ponyville my home,
and to have my pony friends as my family.

21:18.782 --> 21:21.449
Yours truly, Spike.

21:25.571 --> 21:27.350
Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee!

21:27.501 --> 21:32.140
Stick with me, I've got plenty
to teach you about being a pony.
