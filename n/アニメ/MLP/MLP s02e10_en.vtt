WEBVTT

00:04.139 --> 00:05.923
No distractions.

00:07.679 --> 00:10.409
Today is too important.

00:11.698 --> 00:13.883
Reshelving day!

00:22.010 --> 00:26.026
"Understanding Medieval Equestria"
goes in... Pony History.

00:26.027 --> 00:29.063
"Modern Spellcasting" â€“
that's Classics.

00:29.901 --> 00:34.199
"The Art of the To-Do List". Actually,
I kinda wanna read that again.

00:37.910 --> 00:40.134
Spike! What are you laughing at?

00:40.373 --> 00:43.370
This little beauty. It's my
birthday present to myself.

00:43.371 --> 00:45.842
It's a fire ruby.

00:46.612 --> 00:50.089
I've been aging it for months.
And it's almost ripe!

01:01.416 --> 01:03.280
Hey! You took my advice!

01:03.281 --> 01:06.120
Just use the whole
floor as one big shelf.

01:45.706 --> 01:49.996
Hello! Anypony home? Twilight!

01:51.235 --> 01:53.866
Is that a fire ruby?

01:54.816 --> 01:57.094
That must be at least twenty carats!

01:57.095 --> 01:59.433
No inclusions, pristine facets...

01:59.434 --> 02:01.129
And totally delicious.

02:01.130 --> 02:03.092
Uh, you guys don't mind?

02:03.620 --> 02:05.404
Oh! Uh, of course.

02:05.405 --> 02:09.120
I just came by to see if you hadn't
any books on historical fashion.

02:09.121 --> 02:11.432
Did you say "delicious"?

02:11.433 --> 02:16.125
Sure did! Next week's my birthday.
And this is my birthday dinner.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.170
Start with this one.

02:19.837 --> 02:21.130
Thanks, Twilight.

02:21.131 --> 02:22.637
I've got the feeling
ruffled taffeta capes...

02:22.638 --> 02:24.833
...are going to make a huge
comeback this season.

02:24.834 --> 02:27.151
And I want to be ahead of the game.

02:29.386 --> 02:32.056
I hope it's as tasty
as it is beautiful, Spike.

02:32.057 --> 02:36.030
I've never seen anything
quite so stunning before.

02:39.590 --> 02:42.431
Gosh. You really like it, huh?

02:42.812 --> 02:43.794
Like it?

02:43.795 --> 02:47.124
It's magnificent!

02:52.786 --> 02:54.293
Then you should have it.

02:54.833 --> 02:57.630
This beautiful gem was
meant to to be with you.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.041
I don't know what to say.

03:02.366 --> 03:04.381
This is so thoughtful.

03:04.382 --> 03:06.965
Mm, my little Spikey-wikey!

03:10.940 --> 03:13.586
Thank you so much!

03:13.829 --> 03:15.073
Wow, Spike.

03:15.074 --> 03:18.238
That's one of the kindest, most
generous things you've ever done.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.944
I've never seen Rarity so happy.

03:20.945 --> 03:24.364
I will never wash this cheek again.

03:36.407 --> 03:37.895
Just about finished, Spike?

03:37.896 --> 03:39.463
Everypony will be here soon.

03:39.464 --> 03:40.882
There. Perfect.

03:40.883 --> 03:43.709
Everything looks perfect.

03:43.710 --> 03:45.807
Not quite everything.

03:46.682 --> 03:48.931
A wash cloth? I don't get it.

03:51.644 --> 03:53.403
Oh, no way, Twilight!

03:53.404 --> 03:56.991
I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek
that Rarity kissed and I meant it!

04:02.305 --> 04:04.895
It's over, Spike!
I'm cleaning that cheek!

04:08.655 --> 04:09.975
It's mine!

04:10.380 --> 04:12.574
-Stop it!
-Never!

04:17.875 --> 04:20.306
Happy birthday!

04:23.428 --> 04:26.332
Party time, woohoo!

04:26.686 --> 04:28.677
Are those... for me?

04:28.997 --> 04:31.105
You bet they are, birthday boy.

04:31.106 --> 04:33.226
Happy birthday, Spike.

04:42.557 --> 04:45.027
Don't you know you get
presents on your birthday?

04:46.021 --> 04:49.133
Well, actually this is my first
birthday in Ponyville.

04:49.134 --> 04:51.616
I usually just get one present.

04:51.617 --> 04:54.420
From Twilight. A book.

04:58.647 --> 05:02.580
Speaking of presents, this is
from my new line of taffeta capes.

05:02.581 --> 05:05.037
I'm going to make one for each of you.

05:07.313 --> 05:11.185
I've been inspired by the generosity
of my little Spikey-wikey...

05:11.186 --> 05:13.683
...who gave me this
beautiful fire ruby...

05:13.684 --> 05:16.332
...one of the kindest acts
I've ever experienced.

05:24.583 --> 05:27.912
Applejack, I can't thank you
enough for this great blanket.

05:28.206 --> 05:29.900
I really needed a new one.

05:29.901 --> 05:33.210
Come on, Spike. You already
thanked me fifteen times.

05:33.211 --> 05:35.313
I'm starting to get a little embarrassed.

05:35.314 --> 05:38.160
I know I keep thanking you guys,
but I'm just so grateful.

05:38.161 --> 05:41.055
I wish this party could last forever.

05:41.718 --> 05:42.540
Duh!

05:42.541 --> 05:45.529
Party can't last forever, cause
you have to go to Sugarcube Corner...

05:45.530 --> 05:48.013
...cause the Cakes said they have
a special surprise for you...

05:48.014 --> 05:49.617
...CAUSE IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!

05:49.618 --> 05:51.352
NO WAY!

05:51.973 --> 05:53.972
I said the party can't last forever...

05:53.973 --> 05:56.458
...but it doesn't need to end right now!

05:59.513 --> 06:01.108
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Cake!

06:01.109 --> 06:04.860
There's the dragon of the hour!
Happy birthday, Spike!

06:04.861 --> 06:05.855
Thanks.

06:05.856 --> 06:07.823
When we found out
it was your birthday...

06:07.824 --> 06:10.654
...we couldn't resist
trying out a new recipe.

06:10.655 --> 06:12.316
Sapphire!

06:13.661 --> 06:15.435
Wow!

06:17.143 --> 06:18.783
Thank you so much!

06:20.165 --> 06:23.109
Man! First I get a bunch of great
presents from my best friends...

06:23.110 --> 06:25.669
...and now an amazing sapphire cupcake!

06:25.670 --> 06:27.273
Ho ho, what a day!

06:36.198 --> 06:39.342
Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, Cheerilee.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.847
That's okay. What's got you so excited?

06:47.108 --> 06:49.723
Pinkie Pie told me I should
come to the Cakes...

06:49.724 --> 06:52.139
...so they could give me a treat,
cause it's my birthday today.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.978
Why, happy birthday, Spike!

06:53.979 --> 06:55.942
I wish I had something to give you.

06:57.002 --> 06:57.808
Oh!

07:00.309 --> 07:01.403
Here you go.

07:01.493 --> 07:02.922
Wow. Really?

07:02.923 --> 07:06.171
Sure. Everypony should get
fun gifts on their birthday.

07:08.865 --> 07:11.049
Have a great birthday, Spike.

07:11.050 --> 07:13.825
I wish every day was my birthday.

07:15.262 --> 07:18.974
Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday
to the Cakes and I get a cupcake.

07:18.975 --> 07:22.852
I mention it to Cheerilee
and I get this great hat.

07:34.190 --> 07:35.913
I wonder...

07:35.914 --> 07:39.405
Hey there, Lickety Split! That's
a pretty cool ball you got there!

07:39.406 --> 07:41.823
Did you know it's my birthday?

07:44.085 --> 07:46.287
This in unbelievable!

07:52.026 --> 07:55.003
Hey, Junebug! It's my birthday!

07:56.297 --> 07:58.855
Uh... Happy birthday, Spike.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.054
Aren't you gonna give me something?

08:01.055 --> 08:02.939
You know, like a birthday present?

08:02.940 --> 08:05.900
Um... I... I don't have anything.

08:05.901 --> 08:07.993
Well, how about those
flowers? I'll take those.

08:07.994 --> 08:09.301
Spike!

08:11.412 --> 08:12.715
Sorry, Junebug.

08:12.716 --> 08:15.653
I think Spike might have
gotten a little carried away.

08:15.654 --> 08:17.680
Uh... No problem.

08:17.681 --> 08:19.557
Happy birthday, Spike!

08:20.173 --> 08:23.624
What are you doing? You're
out here demanding gifts now?

08:25.042 --> 08:27.616
Wow. You're right, Twilight.

08:27.617 --> 08:29.220
I don't know what got into me.

08:29.221 --> 08:30.987
Thanks for snapping me out of it.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.089
I'd better go give
Cheerilee her hat back.

08:34.906 --> 08:37.718
No problem. See you at home later?

08:38.087 --> 08:40.068
Sounds good. Bye!

08:44.752 --> 08:48.611
Who else has a present for Spikey-wikey?

08:57.118 --> 08:59.960
Wow. Little rough night sleep, Spike.

08:59.961 --> 09:02.118
I had the weirdest drea...

09:06.357 --> 09:09.446
I can't believe you!
Where'd you get all this...?

09:15.796 --> 09:17.373
What happened?

09:22.906 --> 09:24.825
What's happening to me, Twilight?!

09:24.826 --> 09:27.386
I don't know! Think back to last night.

09:27.387 --> 09:29.063
Did something happen?

09:36.754 --> 09:37.619
Spike.

09:38.503 --> 09:40.681
What did you do after I saw you?

09:41.256 --> 09:43.774
I went to talk to...

09:45.315 --> 09:46.213
Spike!

09:49.097 --> 09:51.021
You went to talk to who?

09:51.550 --> 09:53.595
Oh, um... I don't remember.

09:53.596 --> 09:56.132
Hey, can I have that globe?
You're not using it, right?

09:56.133 --> 09:57.170
Huh?

10:00.854 --> 10:02.171
What about this book?

10:04.720 --> 10:06.688
Spike, I'm worried about you.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.548
You're usually not so... grabby.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.689
My arms aren't usually
THIS LONG EITHER.

10:18.696 --> 10:20.229
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

10:27.413 --> 10:30.785
Well now, what theems to be the problem?

10:30.786 --> 10:32.391
This is Spike...

10:33.347 --> 10:34.920
...and something's wrong with him.

10:34.921 --> 10:36.698
He used to be half this size.

10:36.699 --> 10:39.850
And he keeps trying to take
things that aren't... his.

10:40.103 --> 10:44.219
All right then. Let'th just
have a look-thee, shall we?

10:44.749 --> 10:47.783
Wittle guy not feewing too good?

10:47.784 --> 10:52.729
Who's the brave wittle boy, huh?
Who's the brave one?

10:56.329 --> 10:58.756
So? What do you think, doctor?

10:58.757 --> 11:02.456
Well, I think I know
what the problem is.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.032
He is... a dragon!

11:05.033 --> 11:08.437
That's not the problem.
He's always been a dragon.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.425
Oh. Well, that would explain it.

11:10.426 --> 11:12.841
Listen, I don't know
anything about dragons.

11:12.842 --> 11:16.216
I know about baby ponies.
Maybe you should try a vet.

11:17.874 --> 11:20.209
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

11:21.319 --> 11:23.049
Well, I'm flummoxed.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.242
You bring me a dog â€“ I've
got it diagnosed in seconds.

11:25.243 --> 11:27.455
Snake even faster. But to be honest...

11:27.456 --> 11:30.146
...I've never seen
a real-life dragon before.

11:31.728 --> 11:35.428
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

11:35.429 --> 11:37.030
Set.

11:42.332 --> 11:43.691
Thanks anyway.

11:43.692 --> 11:45.590
Come on, Spike.

11:59.347 --> 11:59.925
Ooh.

11:59.926 --> 12:01.616
He is starting to mature.

12:01.617 --> 12:03.861
Of this fact I am quite sure.

12:03.862 --> 12:07.061
Mature? So he's just... growing up?

12:07.062 --> 12:10.164
But that doesn't explain
why he keeps grabbing things.

12:10.834 --> 12:13.459
A dragon's heart is prone to greed.

12:13.460 --> 12:16.315
A steady diet to make growth speed.

12:16.316 --> 12:20.680
Then the resulting bigger size
only makes their hunger rise.

12:20.681 --> 12:24.413
If this trait should go unchecked,
if Spike continues to collect...

12:24.414 --> 12:27.032
...more growth will certainly occur.

12:27.033 --> 12:29.607
He is going to turn into a monster.

12:30.649 --> 12:31.359
You mean...

12:31.360 --> 12:34.959
...the more things the dragon collects,
the bigger and greedier he gets?

12:34.960 --> 12:38.051
But how do we stop him before
he's completely out of control?

12:38.052 --> 12:40.896
If his monstrous ways
you wish to impede...

12:40.897 --> 12:44.290
...you must prevent him
from practicing greed.

12:53.045 --> 12:55.114
Get away from her, you brute!

12:55.115 --> 12:57.127
SPIKE WANT!

12:57.528 --> 12:59.815
You're not getting my scooter!

13:00.484 --> 13:02.349
SPIKE WANT!

13:04.933 --> 13:06.413
Hey, Spike!

13:06.414 --> 13:09.200
Check out this amazing broom.

13:11.882 --> 13:15.090
SPIKE WAAANT!!!

13:21.389 --> 13:25.427
Come on, big boy.
Look at this incredible broom.

13:30.233 --> 13:33.689
SPIKE WANT!

13:36.198 --> 13:39.474
Fight all you want.
I'm not letting you out.

13:45.900 --> 13:49.922
Ugh, Spike.
I just reshelved this room.

13:57.296 --> 13:58.772
What now?

14:06.420 --> 14:09.503
Now who in Ponyville
would steal my apples?

14:09.504 --> 14:11.991
For that matter, who
would steal my leaves?

14:11.992 --> 14:13.083
Applejack, help!

14:13.084 --> 14:15.560
Spike's running wild and
I need you to lasso him!

14:18.956 --> 14:20.523
Oh, that's a good one, Twilight.

14:20.524 --> 14:22.819
Sweet little Spike running wild.

14:22.836 --> 14:24.184
What a laugh.

14:27.828 --> 14:29.977
Twilight, get my rope.

14:43.452 --> 14:45.458
HEEELP!

14:46.481 --> 14:47.359
Huh?

14:52.561 --> 14:55.825
Don't tell me you...
you tied yourselves up?

14:56.245 --> 14:57.576
Get us out of here right now!

14:59.864 --> 15:00.927
What was that?

15:00.928 --> 15:03.360
Sounded like Fluttershy to me.

15:03.825 --> 15:05.900
Fluttershy? Fluttershy!

15:06.181 --> 15:08.108
I'm up here!

15:09.359 --> 15:10.578
What happened?

15:10.579 --> 15:13.954
I was helping my squirrel friends
with their dance step...

15:13.955 --> 15:19.721
...and all of a sudden a giant
rampaging d-d-dragon stormed through.

15:19.722 --> 15:21.347
That was Spike!

15:21.348 --> 15:25.541
Spike?! But why would Spike
steal my chicken coop?

15:25.542 --> 15:26.949
He just pulled it out of the ground...

15:26.950 --> 15:29.375
...and filled it with a bunch
of apples and stuff...

15:30.951 --> 15:32.782
That sounded like Pinkie Pie!

15:32.783 --> 15:34.261
Come on, girls!

15:34.829 --> 15:36.487
Back! Get back!

15:43.162 --> 15:45.790
Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake!

15:45.791 --> 15:48.842
I'm not giving him cake!
I'm assaulting him with cake!

15:53.200 --> 15:55.379
How dare you take the cake?!

16:04.998 --> 16:09.034
He's completely out of control.
Who knows where he'll go next?

16:13.918 --> 16:15.478
Perhaps some more ruffle.

16:48.444 --> 16:50.480
Put me down, you brute!

16:54.755 --> 16:56.704
How rude.

16:56.705 --> 16:59.231
Don't worry, Rarity. We'll save you.

16:59.232 --> 17:01.799
Put her down right now!

17:01.800 --> 17:04.253
I-If you wouldn't mind, that is.

17:04.254 --> 17:06.843
I mean it, dragon boy!

17:06.844 --> 17:10.247
We'd be ever so grateful if you'd be
so kind as to possibly consider...

17:10.248 --> 17:12.502
Drop her, scaly!

17:13.265 --> 17:14.029
Hey!

17:14.159 --> 17:18.772
I'm... not some...
sort of common... flyswattaaah!

17:25.468 --> 17:27.316
Girls!

17:27.316 --> 17:29.025
My cape!

17:33.417 --> 17:36.067
Look! The Wonderbolts!

18:21.541 --> 18:23.046
Oh, be quiet.

18:23.047 --> 18:25.375
You've got nothing to be proud of.

18:25.376 --> 18:27.836
You steal everypony's things,
terrorize the town...

18:27.837 --> 18:30.426
...and use me as a weapon
against my own friends.

18:30.427 --> 18:32.996
Which as horrible as it is,
I can almost understand...

18:32.997 --> 18:34.816
...because you're a dragon and all.

18:34.817 --> 18:36.262
BUT THIS...

18:37.806 --> 18:41.411
THIS IS A CRIME AGAINST FASHION!

18:48.924 --> 18:52.625
Oh no! You are not
getting this gemstone!

18:53.701 --> 18:57.588
This was given to me
by my dear friend Spikey-wikey.

18:57.589 --> 19:01.222
The kindest, sweetest,
most generous dragon ever.

19:01.223 --> 19:05.544
And it is too precious to me to give
to a greedy old beast like you!

19:11.832 --> 19:14.737
"Here, Rarity. You take it."

19:14.738 --> 19:19.324
"It would mean even more to see
you happy, than to eat it myself."

19:19.325 --> 19:22.399
"I... I don't know what to say..."

19:22.400 --> 19:24.965
"This is just so generous..."

19:33.266 --> 19:37.161
Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be
eating me or something.

19:39.497 --> 19:43.238
Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?!

19:45.567 --> 19:47.883
Somepony do something!

19:48.269 --> 19:49.257
On it!

19:56.229 --> 20:00.561
Rarity, I need to tell you something.
Just in case we don't make it.

20:02.287 --> 20:04.570
I've always sort of had a crush...

20:19.430 --> 20:23.196
We did it! I can't believe we did it!

20:29.790 --> 20:32.466
All in a day's work.

20:40.014 --> 20:43.784
Spike, I just have to tell you how
absolutely proud I am of you.

20:44.423 --> 20:46.203
Proud of me?

20:46.204 --> 20:51.986
Yes. It was you, who stopped...
you from destroying Ponyville.

20:51.987 --> 20:54.942
You are my hero, Spikey-wikey.

21:01.705 --> 21:03.956
"Dear Princess Celestia."

21:03.957 --> 21:06.703
"Today I learned a great
lesson about friendship."

21:06.704 --> 21:11.135
"Well, you might think that it would feel
good to get lots and lots of stuff..."

21:11.136 --> 21:14.021
"...but it doesn't feel nearly as great
as giving something special..."

21:14.022 --> 21:16.356
"...to somepony you really care about."

21:16.398 --> 21:20.105
"Why, I learned that it truly
is better to give than to receive..."

21:20.106 --> 21:23.441
"...and that kindness and generosity
are what lead to true friendship."

21:23.623 --> 21:27.823
"And that's more valuable
than anything in the world."

21:27.824 --> 21:31.520
Well, almost anything.

21:32.939 --> 21:36.439
