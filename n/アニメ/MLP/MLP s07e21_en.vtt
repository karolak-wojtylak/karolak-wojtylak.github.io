WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:07.773
OK! Let's see how
your still-life's

00:07.875 --> 00:09.508
comin' along, Kettle Corn.

00:11.477 --> 00:14.947
Well, that certainly
is... round.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.482
I can make it rounder.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.685
I'm afraid that's all
the time we have today.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.253
We'll try something
else tomorrow.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.155
But I like circle-painting.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.591
And on the way to figuring
out what you're meant to do,

00:25.793 --> 00:27.727
you'll find a ton
more stuff you like.

00:27.929 --> 00:31.029
That's what makes looking for
your cutie mark so great.

00:31.131 --> 00:31.930
Mmmhmmm!

00:38.205 --> 00:40.405
Sorry everypony,
we're closin' up shop.

00:40.507 --> 00:41.840
Glad to help you out tomorrow.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.775
Awwww!

00:46.147 --> 00:48.213
I don't know if we can
help them tomorrow.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.717
Working with blank flanks
one at a time takes forever.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.752
If only there was a
way we could help

00:53.854 --> 00:55.454
a whole herd of
'em at once.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.822
That would be perfect!

00:56.924 --> 00:59.224
We'd save time and they
could help each other.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.260
Just like we used to!

01:01.362 --> 01:02.928
Aw, but it'd have to be
somewhere big enough

01:03.030 --> 01:04.964
to handle all those
blank flanks.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.899
Somewhere outside...

01:07.001 --> 01:08.901
with tons of
activities to try!

01:09.203 --> 01:11.237
Are you two thinking
what I'm thinking?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.605
CUTIE MARK DAY CAMP!

01:13.907 --> 01:15.474
And I know just the place.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.743
Applejack used to go there
when she was little!

01:17.845 --> 01:19.711
CAMP FRIENDSHIP!

01:19.913 --> 01:20.446
Oh.

01:20.548 --> 01:21.346
Sorry.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.482
I thought we were all
gonna yell that one too.

02:12.033 --> 02:13.999
Attention all blank flanks!

02:14.101 --> 02:16.168
And blank flank affiliates!

02:16.370 --> 02:18.103
Come to our Cutie
Mark Day Camp

02:18.205 --> 02:20.572
to find out what
you're truly good at.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.842
Bond with other blank flanks

02:22.944 --> 02:25.344
and find out what you're
meant to do together!

02:29.250 --> 02:30.315
Hey Rumble!

02:30.417 --> 02:31.717
Oh, hey, Crusaders.

02:31.819 --> 02:32.918
Look, I can't stop.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.519
Gotta meet my brother for...

02:34.721 --> 02:35.621
...something.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.956
No problem! Just wanted
to make sure you heard

02:38.058 --> 02:39.625
about our Cutie
Mark Day Camp!

02:39.727 --> 02:41.026
The first session's
tomorrow!

02:45.799 --> 02:47.733
Uh whatchya got
there, little brother?

02:47.935 --> 02:49.301
What? Oh. Nothing.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.670
Come on. I wanna show you a
new dive roll I'm trying.

02:54.874 --> 02:56.708
Scootaloo: Come one, come all!

02:56.810 --> 03:00.679
Cutie Mark Day Camp is for
blank flanks of all kinds!

03:00.981 --> 03:02.147
Hmm...

03:03.417 --> 03:05.717
Welcome Cutie Mark Campers!

03:05.919 --> 03:08.353
Who's excited to be here?

03:08.455 --> 03:09.554
We are!

03:09.656 --> 03:10.723
Whoo hoo!

03:11.625 --> 03:13.525
Well, we're excited too!

03:13.627 --> 03:14.960
At Cutie Mark Day Camp,

03:15.062 --> 03:17.429
you'll be able to try
all kinds of things.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.597
Kayaking!

03:19.666 --> 03:21.066
Scootaloo: Horseshoe tossing!

03:22.101 --> 03:23.569
Circle painting!

03:23.971 --> 03:26.672
You can try 'em all, but
the most important thing

03:26.774 --> 03:29.008
is that you'll be
trying them together.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.508
That's what worked for us!

03:30.610 --> 03:33.212
Thunderlane: Then I bet it'll
work for these little guys too!

03:36.283 --> 03:38.383
I thought you said we
were gonna go practice

03:38.485 --> 03:41.353
for the Wonderbolt's
Ponyville extravaganza show.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.589
I'm going to
Wonderbolt practice.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.991
You're going to
cutie mark practice.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.559
And we're glad to have you!

03:50.364 --> 03:53.265
I can't believe your own
brother is a Wonderbolt.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.636
Uh, Rainbow Dash is
practically my sister

03:57.738 --> 03:59.537
and she's a Wonder Bolt too.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.009
Do you know Spitfire?

04:04.211 --> 04:06.478
I know she'll be
mad if I'm late!

04:06.580 --> 04:09.214
Now you have a good
time and try some stuff.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.882
Who knows what
you'll be good at?

04:13.954 --> 04:15.653
Wow!
My goodness!

04:15.755 --> 04:19.391
All right! Looks like we found
the first activity of the day...

04:19.493 --> 04:21.293
the horseshoe toss!

04:21.395 --> 04:22.427
Whoo hoo!

04:24.065 --> 04:27.132
Well, wish I could stay and
play, but it's time to fly!

04:27.234 --> 04:28.233
Have fun!

04:31.572 --> 04:32.671
Whoa!

04:36.309 --> 04:37.376
C'mon, Rumble!

04:37.478 --> 04:39.444
Step on up and show
us how it's done.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.549
No way he's as good
as his brother.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.586
Eh. Whoops.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.688
Aw, guess I won't be
getting my cutie mark

04:49.790 --> 04:51.457
in the horseshoe toss...

04:51.959 --> 04:53.258
Don't worry about
it, Rumble.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.328
Hardly anypony finds their
calling on the first try.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.029
Eh. I wasn't worried.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.466
Good! 'Cause there's a ton
of other stuff to try!

05:00.668 --> 05:02.367
We'll find you something
you're good at!

05:17.650 --> 05:18.583
Whoops!

05:28.327 --> 05:29.228
Whoopsie.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.340
Whoops.

05:46.145 --> 05:49.748
The first and last lines
have five syllables,

05:49.850 --> 05:52.317
but the middle has seven.

05:52.419 --> 05:53.718
It's called a haiku.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.494
Whoops. I've tried it all.

06:02.596 --> 06:06.564
Time to tell my brother
this.. camp isn't for me.

06:07.633 --> 06:08.734
Come on, Rumble.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.936
Isn't it fun just trying stuff?

06:11.438 --> 06:12.270
Not really.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.077
Yeah!

06:19.179 --> 06:20.245
All right!

06:20.347 --> 06:22.481
Haiku cutie mark!

06:22.583 --> 06:27.252
And I never would have
tried without Skeedaddle.

06:27.654 --> 06:30.122
That's what Cutie Mark
Day Camp is all about.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.758
Working together and
helping each other!

06:35.162 --> 06:37.496
But I can still
come back, right?

06:37.698 --> 06:39.298
And maybe paint some circles?

06:39.800 --> 06:40.532
Of course!

06:40.634 --> 06:42.434
Let's all meet right
back here tomorrow.

06:42.636 --> 06:43.768
Hooray!

06:44.771 --> 06:48.740
Wow. I can't believe we got a
cutie mark on the first day!

06:49.042 --> 06:52.077
Yep. This camp was a
pretty swell idea.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.945
Everypony's really enjoyed it.

06:55.316 --> 06:57.082
Everypony except Rumble.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.950
He didn't have much
luck with anything.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.620
Trying to find out what you're
meant to do can be frustrating.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.423
You remember how long it took
us to get our cutie marks?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.392
I remember the nightmares.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.761
Well, we can't let Rumble
quit camp just because

07:09.863 --> 07:11.930
he didn't find something
he's good at yet.

07:12.032 --> 07:15.033
We'll just have to convince him
to come back and try harder.

07:15.335 --> 07:16.167
Mm hmm!

07:25.212 --> 07:26.078
Hey. Rumble!

07:26.280 --> 07:27.779
What are you all
doing here?

07:27.881 --> 07:30.181
We just wanted to apologize
for not finding anything

07:30.283 --> 07:31.316
you liked today.

07:31.418 --> 07:34.019
Oh. Whatever. It's fine.

07:34.521 --> 07:38.156
It's not fine! It's frustrating
and we know what it's like.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.892
I'm not frustrated!

07:40.494 --> 07:42.794
It's OK. We've
all been there.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.629
But we won't give
up on helping you.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.598
We know you'll get
your cutie mark.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.999
Everypony does!

07:48.201 --> 07:50.068
Actually, I don't
need your help

07:50.170 --> 07:52.003
because I don't want
to get my cutie mark!

07:52.205 --> 07:53.138
What!?

07:56.042 --> 07:58.543
I-I must have
hay in my ears

07:58.845 --> 08:01.179
because I thought I
just heard Rumble say--

08:01.281 --> 08:04.249
You heard right! I don't
want my cutie mark!

08:04.351 --> 08:06.149
[gasp] He said it again!

08:07.887 --> 08:11.823
Not wanting a cutie mark is
like not wanting to breathe.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.859
Everypony wants to know
what they're meant to do.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.327
Hmph! Not this pony.

08:16.629 --> 08:17.596
WHY?

08:17.898 --> 08:20.399
Because Cutie Marks
are silly and...

08:20.801 --> 08:23.402
and they just force you into
one thing your whole life!

08:24.004 --> 08:24.904
That's silly.

08:25.006 --> 08:28.073
Having a cutie mark doesn't
mean you can't do other things.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.975
Yeah! Our cutie marks
are in helping ponies

08:31.077 --> 08:31.977
with their cutie marks,

08:32.079 --> 08:34.846
but I still like making
potions with Zecora.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.616
And when was the last
time you did that?

08:38.218 --> 08:41.620
Um...I-I-I think it was... uh...

08:42.022 --> 08:45.123
Well, we've been pretty busy
helping other ponies lately--

08:45.325 --> 08:48.427
Oh. You mean doing the thing
you got your cutie mark for?

08:48.529 --> 08:51.597
The thing you're stuck doing
for the rest of your life?

08:52.199 --> 08:55.500
OK, maybe we will be doing
that more than anything else,

08:55.602 --> 08:58.003
but we love being
Cutie Mark Crusaders!

08:58.305 --> 09:01.540
Well, that's fine for you, but
I'm not gonna be put in a box!

09:02.775 --> 09:05.277
A blank flank who doesn't
want a cutie mark?

09:05.379 --> 09:08.080
That's gotta be the strangest
thing I've ever heard.

09:08.282 --> 09:12.317
Granny always says, some ponies
have to find their own hay.

09:12.619 --> 09:15.687
Are you sure she didn't
mean "find their own way?"

09:15.889 --> 09:17.689
Huh. That would
make more sense.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.158
I can't believe Rumble isn't
interested in getting

09:20.260 --> 09:23.495
his cutie mark either, but
we can't force him.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.664
And we've got a whole
camp full of ponies

09:25.766 --> 09:27.399
who are interested
in cutie marks.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.733
Mmm hmmm!

09:35.308 --> 09:35.941
Yeah!

09:36.043 --> 09:40.812
Here he comes, the fastest, most
elite flyer in Equestria...

09:41.414 --> 09:42.447
THUNDERLANE!

09:42.549 --> 09:43.782
Uh! Whoa!

09:45.586 --> 09:47.686
Eh.. I was gonna say me.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.055
You're not the only pegasus
in the family, you know.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.624
Aw sorry, little
brother. You're right.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.160
You might be the most elite
flyer in Equestria someday,

09:55.462 --> 09:57.696
but for now, you should
try other things too.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.265
Speaking of which, aren't
you supposed to be at camp?

10:00.567 --> 10:01.100
Pfft.

10:01.202 --> 10:03.568
That camp is for losers
who can't do anything.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.570
Great. So there's no pressure.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.874
You can try everything and not
be worried about looking bad.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.341
I'm not worried about that!

10:10.543 --> 10:11.777
I just don't want
to get a cutie mark

10:11.879 --> 10:13.645
in any of their
ridiculous activities.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.715
Well, you're still
going back tomorrow.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.917
You can't be a
blank flank forever.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.152
Ahhh!

10:25.025 --> 10:28.560
All righty, Cutie Mark Campers,
that's it for jam making.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.564
But this is fun and I didn't
get my cutie mark yet.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.733
What if I'm not good
at anything else?

10:34.935 --> 10:36.134
You don't get a cutie mark

10:36.236 --> 10:37.802
just because you're
good at something,

10:37.904 --> 10:39.337
or even because
you like it.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.905
There's more to
it than that.

10:41.609 --> 10:43.609
I'm real good at
painting circles,

10:44.011 --> 10:46.478
but I got my cutie
mark in haikus.

10:46.580 --> 10:50.582
Which is what I like, but uh I'm
still a blank flank like you.

10:50.884 --> 10:54.119
So, you can't get a cutie
mark in something you like?

10:54.221 --> 10:55.820
Now, we didn't say that.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.088
Rumble: You don't have to.

10:59.191 --> 11:01.093
Rumble, you came back!

11:01.595 --> 11:03.828
Say buh-bye to
painting circles.

11:03.930 --> 11:07.499
You'll be too busy
haikuing from now on!

11:07.901 --> 11:10.068
But... I like circles.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.738
Come on, Rumble, that's
not how cutie marks work.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.007
So that's how cutie marks work?

11:16.309 --> 11:18.343
Am I speaking Olde Ponish?

11:18.445 --> 11:20.178
Apple Bloom: I just said it wasn't!

13:33.246 --> 13:35.013

13:42.455 --> 13:43.487
BLANK FLANKS!

13:44.256 --> 13:45.124
Whoopee!

13:45.926 --> 13:48.560
Now wait just an
apple-pickin' minute, Rumble.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.396
Where do you think you're
leading our campers?

13:51.898 --> 13:53.932
They're not your
campers anymore.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.633
I'm starting a new camp.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.970
Everypony on this
side of the line

13:59.072 --> 14:01.372
is in Camp Blank
Flanks Forever!

14:03.777 --> 14:06.577
But you can't be a
blank flank forever!

14:07.714 --> 14:09.881
That's just the kind of
talk I'd expect to hear

14:09.983 --> 14:11.549
from "Camp Cutie Mark."

14:11.651 --> 14:14.485
Which is why blank flanks
need a camp where we can enjoy

14:14.587 --> 14:17.989
being blank flanks and
appreciate our blank-flankiness

14:18.091 --> 14:20.359
without feeling pressured
to get a cutie mark.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.763
Now, hold on, everypony.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.431
Blank flanks forever!

14:26.533 --> 14:29.067
Blank flanks forever!
Blank flanks forever!

14:29.369 --> 14:34.702
Blank flanks forever!
Blank flanks forever! [cheering]

14:35.875 --> 14:37.609
What just happened?

14:37.711 --> 14:40.145
Has everypony gone mad?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.613
In a word, "yes."

14:48.889 --> 14:50.989
I just can't see
what we did wrong.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.957
I thought everypony
was having fun.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.395
They were until that Rumble
came and made a mess of things.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.263
What are they doing now?

14:58.665 --> 15:01.032
It looks like
whatever they want.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.506
Honestly, it's not
all that different

15:08.608 --> 15:09.941
from what they
were doing here.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.910
Then, what was the point?

15:12.312 --> 15:16.815
The point is that Rumble is a
mad pony who must be stopped!

15:17.017 --> 15:19.284
Sweetie Belle: Now calm
down, Crusaders.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.186
We just need to
talk to him again.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.454
The key is to
remain calm.

15:24.523 --> 15:27.792
[shrill] Cutie Marks
make you SPECIAL!

15:28.094 --> 15:30.261
By putting you in a
special little box!

15:30.663 --> 15:31.629
Special!

15:31.831 --> 15:32.831
Box!

15:33.133 --> 15:34.599
Come on, Sweetie Belle.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.302
I think you've remained
calm long enough.

15:40.339 --> 15:43.041
Kettle Corn, you
covered your cutie mark?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.976
I'm blank flank again.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.211
Keeping
my options open.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.647
I'm more than haikus.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.383
You just
haikued right then!

15:52.185 --> 15:53.418
Don't let them
get in your head.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.286
You're an open-ended
question.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.221
Blank Flanks forever!

15:57.423 --> 15:59.657
Blank Flanks
Forever!

16:02.194 --> 16:05.495
Blank Flanks Forever!
Blank Flanks Forever!

16:08.534 --> 16:10.835
Wow, you're
cracking great!

16:11.237 --> 16:12.170
Thanks!

16:12.472 --> 16:13.638
[gasp] Oh, no!

16:13.940 --> 16:15.840
What if I get a
cutie mark in it?

16:16.142 --> 16:18.409
Then you'll be stuck
doing it forever!

16:18.711 --> 16:21.879
Blank Flanks, no more potential
cutie mark activities!

16:30.022 --> 16:33.024
Well, Cutie Mark
Day Camp is a bust.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.360
No it isn't. It's
a swell idea.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.695
We just can't seem to talk
any sense into that...

16:37.997 --> 16:39.263
that Rumble.

16:43.236 --> 16:48.206
Maybe we can't, but I bet
I know somepony who can.

16:53.545 --> 16:54.979
Let me get this straight.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.882
My little brother
upended your entire camp?

16:57.984 --> 17:00.018
How in Equestria
did he do that?

17:00.320 --> 17:03.386
Well, it started when he
couldn't toss a horseshoe,

17:03.488 --> 17:04.922
or paddle a kayak,
or shoot an arrow,

17:05.024 --> 17:07.292
or use a pencil and we felt bad
that he wasn't good at anything,

17:07.394 --> 17:09.295
but now he doesn't want a cutie
mark at all because he's afraid

17:09.397 --> 17:11.563
he'll get stuck doing something
he doesn't like forever. Y'know?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.032
No. I don't.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.900
Rumble's good at
all that stuff.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.836
Well, that doesn't make
a lick of sense...

17:18.638 --> 17:22.273
unless he was being bad
at stuff on purpose!

17:22.575 --> 17:24.609
Oh. I was afraid of this.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.944
Afraid of what?

17:26.846 --> 17:28.746
Ever since I became
a Wonderbolt,

17:28.848 --> 17:31.549
Rumble's either watching me
or trying to fly like me.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.318
He won't do anything else.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.653
That's why I thought your
camp was such a good idea.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.055
Scootaloo: I don't understand.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.223
If Rumble wants to be
a Wonderbolt someday,

17:39.425 --> 17:40.758
what's wrong with that?

17:40.860 --> 17:43.427
Not a thing, but right
now he isn't even giving

17:43.529 --> 17:45.163
anything else a chance.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.498
Sounds to me like
Rumble isn't afraid

17:47.600 --> 17:49.767
of being "put in
a box" at all.

17:49.869 --> 17:50.569
It doesn't?

17:50.771 --> 17:54.039
Nope. I think Rumble's
already picked out a box.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.275
He's afraid he'll get a cutie
mark that'll keep him from it.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.950
I don't know how to
say this Rumble

18:06.252 --> 18:09.620
but, Blank Flank Forever
Camp is kinda...

18:09.922 --> 18:10.822
Boring?

18:11.224 --> 18:14.359
If we want to stay blank flanks,
we can't risk doing stuff.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.895
What if I get a cutie
mark in being bored?

18:16.997 --> 18:20.131
Scootaloo: Attention blank
flanks of Cutie Mark Day Camp!

18:31.477 --> 18:34.112
The Cutie Mark Crusaders
are pleased to announce

18:34.214 --> 18:37.215
today's special guest--
Thunderlane!

18:39.586 --> 18:41.552
Hey, everypony! It's me!

18:46.024 --> 18:47.892
Ahh!

18:52.131 --> 18:55.266
Anypony who's interested,
gather round for a day

18:55.368 --> 18:58.903
of camp activities with
a genuine Wonderbolt!

19:01.440 --> 19:04.775
Er.. s-s-sorry, Rumble, but
cutie mark or not,

19:04.977 --> 19:06.577
I'm not missing
out on this!

19:10.917 --> 19:12.450
Whoa!

19:43.715 --> 19:47.718
Apple Bloom: All right campers, it's time for
our last activity of the day.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.455
A Wonderbolt obstacle course!

19:51.057 --> 19:53.758
Just like the one they'll fly
through in their upcoming show!

19:53.860 --> 19:56.627
But on the ground, since
not everypony has wings.

20:15.247 --> 20:17.682
Thunderlane? Aren't you
going to run the course?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.950
Nope! I know I'm a Wonderbolt

20:20.052 --> 20:22.219
and my cutie mark is
all about moving fast,

20:22.321 --> 20:24.288
but I really like to cook!

20:24.490 --> 20:25.390
Since when?

20:25.492 --> 20:28.259
We take turns making the
meals at Wonderbolt HQ.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.495
I didn't want to at
first, but now I love it.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.297
I just wish I tried it sooner.

20:34.633 --> 20:35.466
You do?

20:35.768 --> 20:36.667
Of course!

20:36.769 --> 20:38.402
There's more to me
than just flying.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.938
And I bet there's
more to you too.

20:49.848 --> 20:51.782
Obstacles are fun

20:51.884 --> 20:54.585
Running free
through mud and dirt

20:54.987 --> 20:56.754
Beats circle painting!

20:56.856 --> 20:58.923
That haiku pretty
well sums it up.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.463
Looks like Thunderlane was
right about the obstacle course

21:05.565 --> 21:07.098
getting Rumble to
come back over.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.232
Hey, Rumble.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.134
Aren't you gonna do
our Wonderbolt course?

21:10.236 --> 21:11.369
I'm cooking today.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.903
Maybe I'll do the
course tomorrow.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.339
So, you're coming back tomorrow?

21:15.441 --> 21:18.009
You're not worried about
getting your cutie mark?

21:18.311 --> 21:20.745
Nah. I already know
I'm a good flyer.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.313
It kinda runs in the family.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.382
I guess it's time to see
what other stuff I can do.

21:26.385 --> 21:27.451
Hm hm.
