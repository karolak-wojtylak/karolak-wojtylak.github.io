WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:05.504
So in closing, earning a
rockterate in rock studies

00:05.506 --> 00:08.307
from the Equestrian
Institute of Rockology

00:08.309 --> 00:12.844
is no easy feat. I am proud
of each and every one of you.

00:13.781 --> 00:17.449
Uh, each of... No.
Just you actually.

00:20.653 --> 00:25.391
Go Maud! Woo-hoo!
NUMBER ONE! NUMBER ONE!

00:25.393 --> 00:28.594
Fillies and Gentlecolts...

00:28.596 --> 00:31.363
And is that
Magnesium-rich Basalt?

00:34.067 --> 00:39.104
It is my honor to present our
vale-rock-torian, Maud Pie.

00:39.106 --> 00:41.774
Excuse me. "Doctor Pie."

00:43.910 --> 00:46.645
Doctor Pie! DOCTOR PIE!

00:47.047 --> 00:49.181
Rock-ter Pie?!

00:58.559 --> 00:59.657
I'm Maud.

00:59.659 --> 01:04.663
YEAH YOU ARE! BRILLIANT
SPEECH! ENCORE! ENCORE!

01:04.665 --> 01:06.765
There's more, Pinkie.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.267
I'm Maud...

01:09.669 --> 01:12.638
... Pie, thank you.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.444
YOU ARE SO WELCOME!

01:18.446 --> 01:22.548
BRILLIANT SPEECH!
ENCORE! ENCORE! ENCORE!

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee....

02:09.363 --> 02:10.661
You're moving
to Ponyville!

02:10.763 --> 02:12.261
We'll live together
and get bunk beds

02:12.263 --> 02:13.532
and I'll make us fuzzy
slippers that say

02:13.533 --> 02:14.731
"Best Sister
Friends Forever,"

02:14.734 --> 02:16.514
although I probably can't fit
all those words on a slipper

02:16.515 --> 02:18.013
so maybe just "B.S.F.F."

02:18.105 --> 02:19.172
but we don't have
to decide right now

02:19.174 --> 02:20.708
because we'll be together
all the time since

02:20.710 --> 02:24.510
when it comes to Ponyville,
THE DOCTOR IS IN!

02:25.412 --> 02:27.479
Slow down, Pinkie Pie.

02:27.781 --> 02:35.886
You're moving to Ponyville!

02:36.422 --> 02:39.158
I'm not definitely
moving to Ponyville.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.493
Of course you are,
silly. You said--

02:41.495 --> 02:44.830
"There's nothing left to study
back home on the rock farm,

02:44.932 --> 02:47.166
so I might move
to Ponyville."

02:49.336 --> 02:51.703
I'm also considering
Ghastly Gorge.

02:52.105 --> 02:56.375
Hahahahaha classic Maud sense of
humor. You should do stand-up!

02:56.677 --> 02:59.244
I do, but that
wasn't a joke.

02:59.746 --> 03:03.181
GHASTLY GORGE?! That terrible
awful no-fun all-alone canyon

03:03.383 --> 03:05.150
in the middle of nowhere?!

03:05.152 --> 03:07.452
There, or Ponyville.

03:07.454 --> 03:10.155
But Ponyville is
so "eeeee!"

03:10.157 --> 03:12.757
And Ghastly Gorge
is so... "Urghhh."

03:14.294 --> 03:16.361
It's a rock-based
decision.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.464
But what about
B.S.F.F.'s?

03:19.466 --> 03:22.334
That's why I'm giving
Ponyville a chance.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.836
So all I have to do is prove
Ponyville has better rocks

03:24.938 --> 03:28.407
than Ghastly Gorge?
Challenge accepted.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.442
We'll drop your stuff
off at my place and then

03:30.444 --> 03:36.549
hold onto your world cause
it's about. To. Get. ROCKED!

03:37.651 --> 03:39.050
OK.

03:39.852 --> 03:41.953
Ghastly Gorge may have "rocks,"

03:41.955 --> 03:44.556
but our Gem Cave ROCKS!

03:51.999 --> 03:54.166
Ahhhhh? Ahhhhhhhhh? OH!

03:54.168 --> 03:57.736
And look, you never
know who you'll see!

03:57.738 --> 04:01.406
Maud, darling, it's
lovely to see you again.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.708
Congratulations on
your rockterate.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.344
What are you doing now?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.446
Talking to you.

04:07.448 --> 04:10.515
Ah, right. Hahahaha...

04:11.517 --> 04:13.518
Well, if your trained eye

04:13.520 --> 04:16.187
happens to see a
chartreuse gem,

04:16.189 --> 04:18.390
I'm desperate
to find one.

04:19.292 --> 04:20.825
I found one.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.094
Oh, you're an
absolute darling!

04:23.196 --> 04:25.163
This will surely make
my gown stand out

04:25.265 --> 04:28.132
at Countess Coloratura's
album release party.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.468
Do you know how
rare this is?

04:30.470 --> 04:32.103
Just another day
in Ponyville!

04:33.873 --> 04:35.974
That's actually a
really common gem.

04:36.376 --> 04:37.075
Huh?

04:40.747 --> 04:42.815
These are all
really common gems.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.949
They are?!

04:44.951 --> 04:48.253
I mean, come on!
Of course they are.

04:48.255 --> 04:51.956
That's why I didn't bring
you here to impress you.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.958
I wanted to make sure
you had a chance to...

04:53.960 --> 04:57.162
say hello to your
ol' pal... Spike.

04:58.497 --> 04:59.696
Hello, Spike.

04:59.698 --> 05:01.867
Way to go, Maud; cross
that off the to-do list,

05:01.869 --> 05:03.667
you know what I'm
sayin'? Check.

05:03.669 --> 05:05.804
Now let's get moving cause I'm
about to show you something

05:05.806 --> 05:08.307
that'll make you
yell: "ALL RIGHT!"

05:09.409 --> 05:10.442
All right.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.943
See?! Ha ha!

05:15.781 --> 05:19.284
Ta-da! It's a castle...
MADE OF ROCKS!

05:19.986 --> 05:22.253
Whaaaat? Did I just
blow your mind?

05:22.255 --> 05:23.789
I think I just
blew your mind.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.892
A lot of structures are
made from rocks, Pinkie.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.628
They're a very stable
building material.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.530
But this place
grew out of nowhere

05:31.532 --> 05:33.632
after a magical key-filled
gem followed a rainbow

05:33.634 --> 05:35.032
and buried itself
in the ground!

05:35.034 --> 05:38.103
I mean HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN ROCKS LIKE THIS?

05:38.805 --> 05:39.304
Yes.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.507
NO YOU HAVEN'T!

05:42.009 --> 05:44.776
We literally just saw hundreds
of them in the gem cave.

05:45.278 --> 05:49.548
But-- but-- OH LOOK
AT THOSE ROCKS!

05:52.352 --> 05:54.886
Those are sting-bush
seed pods.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.723
So they are. But...

05:57.725 --> 05:59.925
LOOK AT THAT ROCK!

05:59.927 --> 06:03.028
It's even got four smaller
rocks around it like legs!

06:03.430 --> 06:04.863
That's a tortoise.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.235
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON, TANK!?

06:11.337 --> 06:13.405
WAIT A MINUTE! WHAT'S THAT?

06:13.407 --> 06:15.741
It's a rock shaped
like Lyra Heartstrings!

06:18.477 --> 06:20.079
TOTAL ROCK!

06:30.423 --> 06:33.558
I guess you won't be moving
to Ponyville after all.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.527
Those rocks at Ghastly Gorge

06:35.529 --> 06:38.564
don't know how lucky
they are to have you.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.499
Actually, rocks
aren't the only reason

06:41.501 --> 06:43.202
I'm considering Ponyville.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.238
You said it's a
rock-based decision.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.141
I'm obviously passionate
about exotic rocks.

06:49.243 --> 06:52.611
But I've always
studied them... alone.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.246
I could handle some
less exciting rocks

06:55.248 --> 06:58.618
if it meant I'd have somepony
to talk to besides Boulder.

06:59.420 --> 07:03.355
Are you saying you
want... A FRIEND?!

07:03.957 --> 07:05.524
I wouldn't mind one.

07:05.526 --> 07:09.661
[gasp]! Maudileena Daisy
Pie, this'll be easy!

07:09.663 --> 07:11.130
What are you looking
for in a friend?

07:11.132 --> 07:12.830
Gimme six qualities
assigning each one

07:12.832 --> 07:14.800
a numerical importance rating
between one and seven,

07:14.802 --> 07:16.635
seven being essential
and one being "mehhhhhh?"

07:18.438 --> 07:20.772
It isn't hard to
meet somepony I like.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.808
It's finding
somepony who gets me.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.509
I get you.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.812
You're my sister.
It's different.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.681
Maud. You are THE BEST.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.550
You never know when the
lightning of friendship

07:31.552 --> 07:34.019
will strike! Somepony could
come barrelling through

07:34.021 --> 07:36.988
that door at this very moment
and become your best friend!

07:43.664 --> 07:45.630
You know I really thought
somepony was going

07:45.632 --> 07:46.799
to come barrelling
through that--

07:50.470 --> 07:53.905
My fault--totally my
fault. Are you OK?

07:53.907 --> 07:55.841
I should have been watching
where I was going.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.878
You look really familiar...
have we met before?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.079
Yes.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.147
I knew it--!

08:02.649 --> 08:04.316
WHAT?!

08:04.618 --> 08:07.018
Don't tell me,
ummmmmmmmm...

08:11.524 --> 08:13.191
Yeah, see I was really
hoping you'd tell me

08:13.193 --> 08:14.759
while I pretended
to remember.

08:14.761 --> 08:19.231
How is this POSSIBLE?! AHH!

08:19.233 --> 08:21.967
I travelled Equestria for my
rockterate dissertation...

08:28.174 --> 08:30.775
Psst! Do you know a
lot about rocks?

08:30.777 --> 08:32.878
Yes.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.947
Have you ever come across some
kind of super-powerful stone

08:35.949 --> 08:39.050
that can store the cutie-mark
magic of, I don't know,

08:39.052 --> 08:40.552
an entire village?

08:40.754 --> 08:43.255
Yup. In the big cave.

08:49.196 --> 08:54.132
Hahahaha..hahah.. Hey, I
got an idea!

08:54.134 --> 08:56.935
Let's not tell anypony that
part where you maybe for sure

08:56.937 --> 09:00.605
accidentally helped Starlight
enslave a town. Hahahaha!

09:00.607 --> 09:03.175
Tell. No. Pony.

09:03.277 --> 09:06.211
It's not like she's
enslaved anypony lately.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.080
Heheheh...

09:09.082 --> 09:14.019
Well, great seeing you again.
I gotta run a few errands...

09:14.021 --> 09:16.054
Sigh.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.657
Offer to help.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.324
What?

09:19.326 --> 09:22.161
OFFER TO HELP!

09:22.963 --> 09:25.131
You want to help?

09:25.833 --> 09:26.631
Do I?

09:26.833 --> 09:28.667
Of course you do! Go!

09:28.969 --> 09:29.701
OK.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.975
They're totally
gonna be best friends

09:36.977 --> 09:38.777
and then Maud will
choose Ponyville

09:38.779 --> 09:40.912
and we'll get to wear
B.S.F.F. Slippers!

09:49.222 --> 09:50.755
Rocks take on
different properties

09:50.757 --> 09:52.757
when interacting with magic.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.026
With the right stone, you
could rule all of Equestria

09:55.028 --> 09:56.461
if you wanted to.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.199
You're messing with me.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.334
Am I?

10:05.871 --> 10:13.979
Hahahaha... so, other than
rocks, what else are you into?

10:13.981 --> 10:18.850
Minerals, plate tectonics, oh
and stand-up comedy of course.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.854
I like kites.

10:27.093 --> 10:28.827
Kites are cool.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.261
Ah!

10:40.740 --> 10:43.708
The trick with an SLK is not
to make the spars too heavy,

10:43.710 --> 10:45.844
but if they're too
light you got no ballast

10:45.846 --> 10:48.981
and then good luck
tacking against the ALI.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.950
I really like kites.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.885
They're starting
to grow on me.

10:55.888 --> 11:01.760
Pizza delivery! Maud and
Starlight, you're here too?

11:01.762 --> 11:06.331
WHOA what a coincidence,
cause I was just, you know,

11:06.333 --> 11:11.836
delivering this
pizza to, um... you!

11:14.940 --> 11:18.143
So how's it going?

11:18.145 --> 11:19.944
Just hangin' out--

11:19.946 --> 11:21.813
Hey, you could use
this time to bond

11:21.815 --> 11:23.413
and talk about feelings!

11:23.415 --> 11:27.086
For example: do you "feel"
like you're becoming friends?

11:27.188 --> 11:31.523
Um. I "feel"... like I don't
want to talk about feelings?

11:31.625 --> 11:32.923
Great, I'll go next.

11:32.925 --> 11:36.927
I feel like I love that you
two are becoming best friends!

11:37.463 --> 11:39.264
I mean your friendship
could be the friendship

11:39.266 --> 11:41.266
that makes Maud
move to Ponyville!

11:41.268 --> 11:42.803
No pressure, Starlight!

11:45.405 --> 11:48.539
Hello? Where'd
you two go?

11:48.541 --> 11:52.243
Sorry about my sister. There's
no half-excited with her.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.413
Oh, I know. But she always
calms down eventually.

11:58.017 --> 12:00.385
Why do you find
rocks so fascinating?

12:00.387 --> 12:05.056
Each one has a different story
to tell. Like Boulder here...

12:05.058 --> 12:08.326
This tells me he's over
two thousand years old.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.729
You don't look a day
over six hundred.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.465
Wow. You can tell
that from a line?

12:13.467 --> 12:15.065
I didn't get
a rocktorate

12:15.067 --> 12:17.602
because I can shred on
guitar like nopony else.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.237
Hahahaha.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.774
Another reason I like rocks...

12:22.776 --> 12:24.843
they don't exclude
you if you're...

12:24.845 --> 12:27.846
different than
other ponies.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.514
They're beautiful and strong,

12:29.516 --> 12:32.050
but they don't judge you or
make you feel "less than"

12:32.052 --> 12:35.120
in any way. I think I'm
starting to like rocks too.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.393
It's hollow?

12:42.395 --> 12:45.463
It's granite. Hollow
granite is highly unusual.

12:52.506 --> 12:56.875
Wow. Have you ever seen
anything like this?

12:56.877 --> 13:00.545
No. And that's
unusual... for me.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.081
There you are! I thought
you went your separate ways

13:03.083 --> 13:05.083
but you can't imagine
how happy I am to find

13:05.085 --> 13:06.785
you both together
and to witness

13:06.787 --> 13:08.520
one of your firsts
as friends!

13:13.559 --> 13:16.261
Your first time discovering
an underground cavern!

13:16.263 --> 13:19.130
I can't wait till you're old
and eating pistachios together

13:19.132 --> 13:21.166
telling your
grandfoals about this.

13:24.170 --> 13:29.206
Oh, no! They're not
bonding! I GOT AN IDEA!

13:33.045 --> 13:37.816
Whoaaaa! I'm tripping on a
rock at this very moment!

13:37.818 --> 13:39.984
And now I'm falling down!

13:42.956 --> 13:45.256
Oh, no!

13:45.258 --> 13:48.860
My accidental clumsiness
has trapped us here,

13:48.862 --> 13:51.863
where you'll be forced to
bond until we're rescued.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.832
Oh, we don't have
to wait for that!

13:53.834 --> 13:55.200
There's got to be
a spell that--

13:55.202 --> 13:56.534
Get us out of
here, boy!

14:01.541 --> 14:04.509
Boulder! That...
was... AWESOME.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.879
No, that was sandstone.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.448
More sand than
stone, apparently.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.517
I'm thinking you wear
these around your necks

14:12.519 --> 14:14.986
at all times so I don't
lose you again, you sillies!

14:14.988 --> 14:17.956
That way I can track your
progress as friends!

14:18.458 --> 14:22.060
Ooh and tomorrow we could
have a FRIENDSHIP BRUNCH!

14:22.062 --> 14:24.095
What's your favorite
kind of omelette-cupcake?

14:24.097 --> 14:26.898
Mine's jalapeño-red velvet!

14:26.900 --> 14:28.566
Uhhhh....

14:28.568 --> 14:32.036
Yeah, um... I don't
know if I can make it.

14:32.038 --> 14:35.473
You'll change your minds when
you smell the yummy food.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.075
Come on!

14:40.112 --> 14:41.446
"Oops."

14:44.617 --> 14:47.018
Tomorrow's brunch is
gonna be the scrunchiest,

14:47.020 --> 14:49.487
brunchiest munchiest
brunch ever!

14:49.489 --> 14:51.623
Yeah. About that...

14:51.625 --> 14:53.623
The problem is, while
you two were alone,

14:53.625 --> 14:56.427
I couldn't get data points on
your friendship probabilities:

14:56.429 --> 14:57.929
were you making Starlight smile?

14:57.931 --> 15:00.298
How was Starlight's
smile to frown ratio?

15:00.300 --> 15:02.500
Anything over five
to one is GREAT!

15:02.502 --> 15:05.970
Oh, and how many times
did YOU smile like this?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.906
Zero times.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.009
Oh, Maud, don't be
so hard on yourself.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.378
You've got the best
friendship maker in Ponyville

15:13.380 --> 15:17.348
on the case. I'll be by
your side the whole time.

15:17.350 --> 15:21.119
Speaking of which, your
bell fell off, silly!

15:21.121 --> 15:24.222
Pinkie Pie, I appreciate what
you're trying to do, but...

15:24.224 --> 15:28.126
But... ?

15:28.128 --> 15:30.662
Never mind.

15:30.664 --> 15:33.164
Don't worry, Maud. When
you see this brunch,

15:33.166 --> 15:36.534
you'll realize everything's
going to be OK.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.671
And then I have amazing
bonding activities planned

15:39.673 --> 15:41.706
for the next seventeen days!

15:41.708 --> 15:45.410
You and Starlight will
be besties in no time!

15:45.412 --> 15:46.511
Goodnight!

15:55.221 --> 15:56.855
Friendship brunch!

15:58.757 --> 15:59.656
<i> Maud's voice: Pinkie Pie.</i>

15:59.658 --> 16:02.727
<i> Thank you for trying so hard</i>
<i> to help me make friends.</i>

16:02.729 --> 16:05.163
<i> But my decision has</i>
<i> to be rock-based.</i>

16:05.165 --> 16:07.732
<i> And Ghastly Gorge</i>
<i> has such great rocks,</i>

16:07.734 --> 16:11.135
<i> I won't even have time for</i>
<i> friends. It's better this way.</i>

16:11.137 --> 16:13.838
<i> Sorry it didn't</i>
<i> work out. Maud.</i>

16:13.840 --> 16:15.773
Maud, wait!

16:17.744 --> 16:19.077
Maud!

16:21.213 --> 16:22.280
Maud.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.388
STARLIGHT, WAKE UP!

16:30.390 --> 16:31.222
Kites!

16:32.125 --> 16:33.691
Huh?

16:33.693 --> 16:37.462
If this is about brunch,
I uhh... you know what?

16:37.464 --> 16:40.431
Jalapeno red velvet omelettes
sound gross; I just can't.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.034
Maud left in the
middle of the night!

16:43.036 --> 16:46.504
Oh, I guess Ghastly
Gorge really does have

16:46.506 --> 16:48.339
the best rocks.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.410
Why couldn't you
two just be friends?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.779
Pinkie Pie... I
like Maud.

16:54.781 --> 16:55.780
You do?

16:55.782 --> 16:57.882
Yeah, she's weird.

16:57.884 --> 16:58.983
Hey!

16:59.185 --> 17:01.386
No, in a good way.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.654
She sees the world in
a totally different way

17:03.656 --> 17:05.790
than anypony I've ever met.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.159
She accepts me for who I am.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.294
She taught me that a
rock is never just a rock

17:10.296 --> 17:13.264
and she can make anything funny!

17:13.266 --> 17:16.601
And we never had to say it
but... we got each other.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.137
You really were
becoming friends?

17:19.139 --> 17:24.542
I think so, but you kinda,
sorta...got in the way.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.114
You're right. Too
harsh. Let's go with:

17:30.116 --> 17:32.650
"You ruined everything
all the time?"

17:32.652 --> 17:37.255
Ngh... that's worse. What
I'm trying to say is...

17:37.257 --> 17:39.390
I-have-to-go!

17:39.392 --> 17:43.428
Ta-da. Friendship
lesson... learned?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.829
Sigh.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.276
Sorry.

18:10.156 --> 18:13.424
Emerald-Jasper. This
must be my lucky day.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.707
Maud tracks!

18:37.317 --> 18:40.184
Hello, Pinkie Pie. I
found Emerald-Jasper.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.686
AHHHH!

18:46.860 --> 18:50.128
Are you OK, Maud? That
eel almost ate you!

18:50.130 --> 18:50.862
What eel?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.437
You didn't need to come.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.706
I'm having a great
time on my own.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.176
I even made a new friend.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.477
Is it a rock?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.612
Yes.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.717
Maud!

19:12.719 --> 19:15.353
I don't belong
in Ponyville.

19:15.355 --> 19:18.256
It only proved I'm
better off all by myself,

19:18.258 --> 19:20.324
like I always have been.

19:20.326 --> 19:25.530
DON'T SAY THAT! It was
all my fault! I-- LOG!

19:25.532 --> 19:27.832
I thought I knew everything
about making friends.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.268
But I didn't even
know my own sister.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.203
I forced you to
do things my way,

19:32.205 --> 19:35.439
but my way isn't your way.

19:35.441 --> 19:36.841
This way.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.743
Exactly.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.345
No, this way.

19:45.785 --> 19:49.387
Maud. I thought you couldn't
make a friend without my help.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.623
But it turns out, you couldn't
make a friend with my help.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.960
I underestimated
you and I'm sorry.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.929
I know you did
it out of love.

19:57.931 --> 20:01.232
You're my Best Sister
Friend Forever.

20:03.403 --> 20:10.308
OH MAUD, I LOVE YOU
BIGGER THAN ALL EQUESTRIA!

20:10.310 --> 20:11.943
And you melt my
heart more easily

20:11.945 --> 20:15.580
than sodium-rich
plagioclase feldspar.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.615
I don't know
what that means,

20:17.617 --> 20:20.318
but please-please-
please -please- PLEASE

20:20.320 --> 20:22.453
give Ponyville
another chance.

20:22.455 --> 20:26.290
But more importantly,
give me another chance...

20:26.292 --> 20:28.859
to leave you alone.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.628
What do you
think, Boulder?

20:37.403 --> 20:38.836
You're back!

20:38.838 --> 20:39.938
Mm hm.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.906
For good... ?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.406
Mm hm.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.810
This doesn't mean we need to
start talking about feelings,

20:45.812 --> 20:46.911
does it?

20:47.613 --> 20:49.113
No way.

20:51.316 --> 20:53.818
Maybe after this, we could
decorate my new place.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.287
Totally. Where
is it?!

20:56.289 --> 20:59.023
Well, it's not
in Ponyville...

20:59.025 --> 21:00.992
... more like
Ponyville adjacent.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.435
It's perfect.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.438
YES! MY SISTER'S TOTALLY
STAYING IN PONYVILLE!

21:14.440 --> 21:15.973
I MEAN PONYVILLE
ADJACENT!

21:15.975 --> 21:17.975
Ahh ha ha!

21:21.280 --> 21:23.748
Sorry, sorry, I'm leaving. I
promise. I'm not even here.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.383
EEE, you're wearing
the slippers!

21:25.385 --> 21:27.485
OK, now I'm really
leaving. Bye!

21:29.521 --> 21:31.355
Heh heh. Wrong way.
