WEBVTT

00:34.822 --> 00:36.039
Perfect.

00:42.145 --> 00:44.569
Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity.

00:44.570 --> 00:46.839
Don't you all care about nothin'
other than prettifyin'?

00:47.122 --> 00:48.566
Somepony has to.

00:48.747 --> 00:52.153
You are making an absolute mess
of the town square, Applejack.

00:53.078 --> 00:55.113
Yeah, well, the storm's gonna
make an even bigger mess...

00:55.114 --> 00:58.843
...if we don't prune all these loose branches
so they don't tumble down on anypony.

00:59.130 --> 01:03.754
I simply cannot imagine why the pegasus ponies
would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening...

01:03.755 --> 01:06.527
...and ruin what could have been
a glorious sunny day.

01:08.584 --> 01:10.624
Think more practical-like, will ya?

01:10.724 --> 01:13.837
They accidentally skipped
a scheduled sprinkle last week, so...

01:13.838 --> 01:16.415
...we need a doozy of a downpour
to make up for it, is all.

01:18.210 --> 01:22.158
Oh no! My wonderfully styled
mane shall be ruined!

01:22.159 --> 01:24.847
You shoulda hurried up and
finished the job, already.

01:26.284 --> 01:27.828
It's coming down too fast!

01:28.995 --> 01:30.093
Help me!

01:34.003 --> 01:37.807
There. Hunker down to your heart's content
whilst I finish this.

01:41.473 --> 01:43.320
Ooh, no no nooo!

01:44.609 --> 01:45.893
What now?

01:46.093 --> 01:48.240
I'd prefer not to get my hooves muddy.

01:48.634 --> 01:51.532
Gah. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there?

01:51.533 --> 01:53.471
Everything's gotta be just so.

01:53.871 --> 01:57.354
Well, and how does muddying my hooves
serve any useful purpose?

01:57.357 --> 01:59.787
You wouldn't know useful
if it came up and bit you.

02:00.171 --> 02:02.132
That doesn't even make any sense.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.561
-Does so.
-Does not.

02:03.562 --> 02:04.989
-Does so.
-Does not.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.401
-Does so.
-Does not.

02:06.402 --> 02:08.522
Does so infinity. Hah!

02:08.523 --> 02:10.632
Does not infinity plus one. Heh.

02:14.892 --> 02:20.253
What's say we go our separate ways before
one of us says something she will regret?

02:20.254 --> 02:24.201
I reckon y'all are gonna say
something you'll regret first.

02:24.202 --> 02:28.985
On the contrary. I believe it shall almost certainly
be you who says something you will regret first.

02:29.363 --> 02:31.734
-I'm not sayin' anythin'.
-Nor am I.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.698
-You'll just be on your way then?
-After you.

02:41.127 --> 02:44.117
Perhaps we should stick together
for now and find some shelter.

02:44.399 --> 02:46.321
Uh-huh. Perhaps we should.

02:47.202 --> 02:48.374
And fast.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.859
Nice and dry under here.

03:36.959 --> 03:37.786
Sorta.

03:38.311 --> 03:40.214
Ooh! Unacceptable.

03:40.431 --> 03:42.736
Applejack! Rarity!

03:44.100 --> 03:47.273
Applejack! Rarity!

03:48.122 --> 03:49.241
Twilight?

03:49.828 --> 03:51.503
Come inside, girls, quick.

03:56.638 --> 03:57.653
Whoa, Nelly.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.870
Is inside a tree really the best place
to be in a lightnin' storm?

04:00.871 --> 04:04.098
It is if you have a magical lightning rod
protecting your home like I do.

04:04.124 --> 04:05.314
Come on in.

04:06.767 --> 04:09.685
We are most grateful for your invitation.

04:09.686 --> 04:11.613
Thank ya kindly for your hospitality.

04:15.049 --> 04:15.882
Uh...

04:15.883 --> 04:19.127
Do be a polite houseguest and
go wash up, please, von't you?

04:20.762 --> 04:24.191
If I gotta spend one more second
with that fussbudget Rarity today...

04:24.192 --> 04:26.643
...I can't be held responsible
for what I'm gonna do.

04:26.821 --> 04:28.139
Some storm, huh?

04:28.140 --> 04:31.168
The pegasus ponies sure have
outdone themselves this time.

04:31.169 --> 04:33.941
I hope you and Applejack
don't have any trouble getting home.

04:34.351 --> 04:36.649
It may indeed be a problem.

04:37.339 --> 04:39.118
Well, you're welcome to stay if need be.

04:39.119 --> 04:41.301
Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business.

04:41.302 --> 04:42.964
I'm home all alone tonight.

04:43.952 --> 04:46.340
You and Applejack should totally sleep over!

04:46.341 --> 04:49.251
We'll have a slumber party.
I've always wanted one of those.

04:50.495 --> 04:51.884
Oh! Oh, goodness.

04:51.885 --> 04:56.073
Uh... I do believe I have another
engagement scheduled for this evening...

04:56.074 --> 04:59.223
...that completely slipped my
mind until just now, hahahah.

04:59.224 --> 05:02.456
Oh, silly me. I can't possibly stay here all night...

05:02.708 --> 05:04.028
...with Applejack.

05:13.480 --> 05:19.268
"Slumber 101: All You've Ever Wanted to Know
About Slumber Parties (But Were Afraid to Ask)"

05:19.269 --> 05:22.963
My own personal copy.
It's a fantastic reference guide.

05:22.964 --> 05:24.664
You should see the table of contents.

05:24.665 --> 05:28.210
I've been waiting for a chance to use it
and today is the day.

05:28.211 --> 05:30.306
This is gonna be so great!

05:30.974 --> 05:32.987
Yes, uh... Great.

05:49.895 --> 05:51.493
What in tarnation?!

05:58.169 --> 06:00.186
Now wait just a goll-darn minute.

06:00.187 --> 06:02.340
You made me wash the mud off my hooves...

06:02.382 --> 06:04.755
...but it's okay for y'all
to have mud all over your faces?

06:05.052 --> 06:08.059
Silly. This is called a mud mask.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.795
It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.

06:10.878 --> 06:13.318
We're giving each other makeovers!

06:14.605 --> 06:16.912
We have to do it. It says so in the book.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.042
"Slumber 101: Everything You..."

06:22.233 --> 06:24.685
Oh, hay. Would you look at the time.

06:24.686 --> 06:27.421
I gotta skedaddle on home quick,
I'm powerful late for, uh...

06:27.609 --> 06:28.253
...somethin'.

06:28.254 --> 06:29.208
Uh, g'night!

06:33.470 --> 06:35.956
Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell.

06:36.056 --> 06:38.382
Hurray! Slumber party!

06:45.914 --> 06:47.824
What in the world is this for?

06:48.850 --> 06:52.157
To reduce the puffiness
around one's eyes, of course.

06:52.158 --> 06:53.936
Puffiness-shmuffiness.

06:55.653 --> 06:56.895
That's good eatin'.

07:00.334 --> 07:02.742
Isn't this exciting?
We'll do everything by the book.

07:02.743 --> 07:05.714
And that will make my
slumber party officially fun.

07:06.109 --> 07:08.007
Did you hear that, Applejack?

07:08.008 --> 07:13.271
You certainly would not want to do anything that
would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party...

07:13.272 --> 07:14.629
...would you?

07:15.463 --> 07:16.940
Of course not.

07:16.941 --> 07:18.799
'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?

07:18.924 --> 07:20.761
So do we have an agreement?

07:20.762 --> 07:22.309
You betcha.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.517
Oh! Gross!

07:26.123 --> 07:29.725
You know, there's messy
and there's just plain rude.

07:30.079 --> 07:34.251
You know, there's fussy and there's
just plain gettin' on my nerves.

07:34.576 --> 07:39.442
Fortunately, I can get along with anypony,
no matter how difficult she may be.

07:39.443 --> 07:40.568
Oh yeah?

07:40.569 --> 07:43.750
Well, I'm the get-alonginest pony you're ever gonna meet.

07:43.851 --> 07:45.598
That's not even a word.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.660
This is gonna be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!

07:48.895 --> 07:50.115
Yay.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.380
Sooo...

08:00.381 --> 08:03.710
How are you "getting along" over there, Applejack?

08:03.901 --> 08:05.983
Just fine, Rarity

08:06.571 --> 08:08.608
This is so awesome.

08:09.116 --> 08:10.561
Makeovers: check.

08:14.589 --> 08:18.071
Ooh! It says here we have to
tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first?

08:18.072 --> 08:19.195
Me!

08:19.820 --> 08:24.119
I'd like to tell y'all a terrifying tale
of the prissy ghost...

08:24.219 --> 08:27.867
...who drove everypony crazy
with unnecessary neatness.

08:30.514 --> 08:33.083
I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one.

08:33.084 --> 08:36.056
Never heard of it. But I have a much better one.

08:36.548 --> 08:41.896
It's the horrifying story
of the messy, inconsiderate ghost...

08:41.897 --> 08:46.292
...who irritated everypony
within the hundred miles.

08:48.893 --> 08:51.082
That's not a real story. You made it up.

08:51.083 --> 08:54.079
It is a ghost story. They're all made up.

08:57.211 --> 08:58.313
I've got one!

08:58.314 --> 09:03.374
This story is called
"The legend of the Headless Horse".

09:05.001 --> 09:07.449
It was a dark and stormy night...

09:07.450 --> 09:12.366
...just like this one. And three ponies
were having a slumber party.

09:12.367 --> 09:15.439
Just. Like. This one.

09:18.985 --> 09:22.279
...and just when the last pony
thought she was safe...

09:22.723 --> 09:26.111
...there, standing right behind her.

09:26.919 --> 09:29.566
Just inches away was...

09:30.192 --> 09:31.842
The Headless Horse!

09:39.142 --> 09:40.641
Ghost story: check.

09:43.405 --> 09:45.761
Now, who wants s'mores?

09:48.243 --> 09:50.745
...then you place one marshmallow
on the top of the chocolate...

09:50.746 --> 09:52.339
...and be sure it's centered - that's critical...

09:52.340 --> 09:56.838
...and then carefully put another
perfectly square graham cracker on the top.

09:56.839 --> 09:59.369
Aaand... done! Ta-da!

10:01.073 --> 10:02.616
Nah, you just eat 'em.

10:10.865 --> 10:13.391
You could at least say "excuse me".

10:13.553 --> 10:16.390
Oh, I was just about to
but you interrupted me.

10:17.511 --> 10:18.337
Pardon.

10:19.237 --> 10:20.853
S'mores: check.

10:21.113 --> 10:23.315
Now, the next item of fun we have to do is...

10:23.316 --> 10:24.623
...Truth of Dare.

10:24.944 --> 10:29.675
I dare Applejack to do something
carefully and neatly for a change.

10:29.676 --> 10:33.013
Oh yeah? Well, I dare Rarity to lighten up...

10:33.014 --> 10:37.413
...and stop obsessin' over every
last little detail for a change.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.651
I think the truth of the matter...

10:39.652 --> 10:43.424
...is that somepony could stand
to pay a little more attention to detail.

10:43.511 --> 10:47.652
And I think the truth is somepony
ought to quit with their fussin'...

10:47.653 --> 10:49.701
...so the rest of us can get things done.

10:49.987 --> 10:52.599
Um... I don't think this is
how the game's supposed to work.

10:52.818 --> 10:57.758
"You have to give an honest answer to any question
or do whatever anypony dares you to do."

10:58.054 --> 11:00.552
I dares you to step outside...

11:00.553 --> 11:03.968
...and let your precious
tidy mane get ruined again.

11:05.405 --> 11:07.527
You have to. It's the rule.

11:07.614 --> 11:08.314
HA!

11:08.500 --> 11:09.322
Fine!

11:21.555 --> 11:24.379
Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress up...

11:24.380 --> 11:26.958
..in a frou-frou glittery lacey outfit.

11:33.508 --> 11:34.423
Happy?

11:34.748 --> 11:35.529
Very.

11:36.213 --> 11:38.124
Um... do I ever get a turn?

11:38.524 --> 11:41.411
I dare you to enter the next rodeo
when it comes to town.

11:41.607 --> 11:44.611
I dare you *not* to enter the next rodeo
that comes to town.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.473
I dare ya to not comb your mane
a hundred times for a bit!

11:47.519 --> 11:49.598
And I dare you to comb yours just once!

11:49.728 --> 11:53.383
I, uh... I think we should check off
Truth of Dare and move on.

11:53.384 --> 11:56.161
Let's see what our next
fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we?

11:56.753 --> 11:58.348
Hm... What does this mean?

11:58.349 --> 11:59.749
Pillow fight?

11:59.954 --> 12:05.460
Oh, please. I am not at all interested
in participating in something so crude.

12:09.207 --> 12:11.547
IT... IS... ON!

12:35.609 --> 12:37.285
Oh, I get it!

12:37.782 --> 12:39.392
Pillow-fight.

12:39.552 --> 12:40.443
Fun!

12:43.437 --> 12:47.503
Uh... girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch.

12:48.483 --> 12:49.827
I will if she will!

12:50.713 --> 12:51.848
She started it!

12:57.374 --> 13:00.310
Maybe we should just call it
a night and get some sleep.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.500
Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.

13:09.501 --> 13:10.944
My hooves ain't muddy.

13:11.210 --> 13:13.814
They were. There might still be a little on them.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.591
There ain't. See?

13:19.923 --> 13:21.521
Now who's bein' inconciderate?

13:25.221 --> 13:28.133
I have to make the bed again
so the blanket will be right.

13:28.134 --> 13:28.814
Get up!

13:29.123 --> 13:29.878
Hey!

13:38.102 --> 13:39.066
Uh-uh-uh.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.630
You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this.

13:48.547 --> 13:50.424
Yeah... that's not gonna happen.

13:50.642 --> 13:52.033
GERONIMO!

13:52.459 --> 13:53.235
Hey!

13:55.851 --> 13:57.609
You did that on purpose.

13:57.821 --> 13:59.358
Um.. yeah.

13:59.582 --> 14:01.286
Get up so I can fix it again!

14:01.481 --> 14:03.632
Can't hear ya, I'm asleep.

14:08.838 --> 14:10.603
I ain't budgin'.

14:10.789 --> 14:13.044
[You will if you want any blanket.]

14:16.118 --> 14:17.158
[Give it back!]

14:17.398 --> 14:18.344
[I will not!]

14:18.432 --> 14:19.458
[Yes, you will!]

14:19.760 --> 14:21.325
-[Won't!]
-[Will!]

14:21.866 --> 14:22.920
-[Won't!]
-[Will!]

14:22.921 --> 14:24.152
-[Won't!]
-[Will!]

14:24.261 --> 14:25.833
ENOUGH!

14:26.766 --> 14:28.777
It says right here that the number one thing...

14:28.778 --> 14:31.583
...you're supposed to do at a
slumber party is have fun!

14:31.584 --> 14:34.394
And thanks to you two I can't check that off.

14:34.896 --> 14:37.343
I've been tryin' my darnest to get along!

14:37.443 --> 14:40.477
No, it is I who have been trying *my* best.

14:40.563 --> 14:42.527
-No, it was me!
-No, it was I!

14:42.528 --> 14:43.622
-Me!
-I!

14:43.860 --> 14:46.361
*I* hope you're happy. Both of you.

14:46.362 --> 14:48.214
You've ruined my very first slumber party.

14:48.314 --> 14:51.014
The makeover, the s'mores,
Truth of Dare, the pillow fight...

14:51.015 --> 14:53.858
I mean, is there anything else
that could possible go wrong?

14:57.455 --> 14:58.986
Sorry I asked.

15:12.122 --> 15:16.554
You see? That's why we needed
to take down all those loose branches in town.

15:16.555 --> 15:18.093
Not spiffy 'em up.

15:18.094 --> 15:18.504
But I...

15:18.505 --> 15:20.997
Out of my way, missy. Time's a-wastin'.

15:23.630 --> 15:25.179
Wait! Stop! Don't!

15:25.426 --> 15:28.771
No waitin'! No stopin'! Doin'!

15:30.637 --> 15:33.817
And that, my friends, is what
we call gettin' 'er done.

15:47.963 --> 15:50.995
I tried to tell you it would
come crashing down in here.

15:52.395 --> 15:54.310
Well, you shoulda tried harder.

15:59.984 --> 16:01.888
I'm mighty sorry, Twilight.

16:01.889 --> 16:05.688
It's... well, it no okay!

16:05.689 --> 16:08.297
It's a giant tree branch
in the middle of my bedroom!

16:08.298 --> 16:12.180
And the book doesn't say anything about having
a giant tree branch in your slumber party.

16:12.254 --> 16:14.084
Or at least I haven't found that entry yet.

16:17.467 --> 16:19.677
What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?

16:19.892 --> 16:22.176
Cleaning up this mess somepony made.

16:22.177 --> 16:25.146
Who was that again? Oh, right. That's you.

16:29.957 --> 16:31.584
We gotta do somethin'!

16:31.746 --> 16:35.719
Baking... BFFs... Brothers...
There's nothing in here about branches!

16:42.734 --> 16:44.492
Rarity, for pony's sake!

16:44.493 --> 16:47.500
Stop sweatin' small stuff
and help me get rid of this thing!

16:49.468 --> 16:52.121
I said hussle over here and help me!

16:54.671 --> 16:55.400
Look...

16:56.354 --> 16:57.938
I'm sorry, alright?

16:58.265 --> 16:59.232
What was that?

16:59.432 --> 17:01.271
I said I'm sorry!

17:01.644 --> 17:05.121
I shoulda listen to you when you noticed
where this here branch would end up.

17:05.515 --> 17:09.258
You annoin' attention to detail
woulda save us from this whole mess.

17:09.259 --> 17:14.089
But right now, you need to stop being so dang
fussy, pickin' up all those little things...

17:14.090 --> 17:17.385
...and help me move the one big thing in here
that actually matters.

17:18.897 --> 17:19.871
Please!

17:24.121 --> 17:25.876
But I'll get all icky!

17:26.328 --> 17:27.471
Consarnit...!

17:27.571 --> 17:29.982
What a... You... I mean... Yes.

17:29.983 --> 17:32.546
Ickiness is often a side effect of hard work.

17:32.746 --> 17:37.274
But y'all need to get over it on account of
I just can't fix this mess I made myself.

17:38.004 --> 17:39.591
I need your help.

17:45.591 --> 17:46.835
Let's do this!

17:49.512 --> 17:52.275
Well, they do have a section
about backyard slumber parties.

17:52.276 --> 17:55.254
Is that what we're doing right now?
Does this count as camping?

18:28.950 --> 18:30.653
I look awful.

18:37.471 --> 18:38.176
Better?

18:41.428 --> 18:42.302
Thanks.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.647
Oh, pretty. Where did these come from?

18:53.145 --> 18:54.469
They're not in the book either.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.411
Is it bigger than a barn?

19:03.576 --> 19:04.506
Nope.

19:04.507 --> 19:06.307
Is it smaller than a saddle?

19:06.852 --> 19:09.848
No. Only three of your twenty questions left.

19:10.372 --> 19:13.511
Oh, we're never gonna guess
what you're thinkin' of. It could be anythin'.

19:13.665 --> 19:15.346
Are we getting warmer?

19:15.676 --> 19:18.766
Why? Is it too cold in here for you?
I can turn up the heat.

19:19.013 --> 19:22.095
She means are we gettin'
any closer with our guesses.

19:22.551 --> 19:24.365
Oh...! No.

19:24.439 --> 19:27.743
And that technically counted as a question,
so only two more left.

19:29.054 --> 19:30.790
Is it...

19:31.484 --> 19:34.967
...a sixed-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted
mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?

19:34.968 --> 19:38.214
Who flies through the air all over
the world to hide magic sparkly eggs?

19:39.871 --> 19:41.240
That's it!

19:41.510 --> 19:42.922
It is?

19:43.047 --> 19:43.845
No.

19:45.228 --> 19:46.479
It's that.

19:48.498 --> 19:51.255
But it was just so nice to see
you two finally getting along...

19:51.256 --> 19:53.688
...I wanted you to be able to win together.

19:57.853 --> 20:01.417
See? We could have been
having fun like this all along.

20:02.009 --> 20:05.272
If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.

20:05.372 --> 20:09.168
Well, maybe she wouldn't have been
if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.

20:12.997 --> 20:15.215
Sorry for bein' just a pain in the patootie.

20:15.463 --> 20:17.660
Oh no, I'm sure I was much worse.

20:17.953 --> 20:20.341
That's kind of you to say,
but I'm the one who's sorry.

20:20.541 --> 20:22.373
Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are.

20:22.573 --> 20:24.126
-Are not.
-Are too.

20:24.204 --> 20:25.602
-Are not.
-Are too.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.250
-Are not.
-Are too.

20:30.876 --> 20:34.614
I declare my first slumber party a success!

20:37.263 --> 20:39.231
Have fun: check.

20:40.617 --> 20:42.616
Now take two steps your left.

20:42.816 --> 20:44.605
Uh, no. My left.

20:44.774 --> 20:46.355
Whi... Which is it?

20:48.500 --> 20:51.186
That mess is your fault, not mine.

20:53.621 --> 20:54.281
Sorry.

20:54.282 --> 20:55.994
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:55.995 --> 21:01.132
"It's hard to believe that two ponies who seem
to have so little in common could ever get along."

21:01.133 --> 21:04.275
"But I found out that if you embrace
each others differences..."

21:04.276 --> 21:07.894
"...you just might be surpriced to
discover a way to be friends after all."

21:08.225 --> 21:09.094
So...

21:10.636 --> 21:13.421
Who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night?

21:18.201 --> 21:20.159
How about a week from Thursday?

21:20.351 --> 21:23.683
Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday?
A month from now?

21:30.376 --> 21:33.876
