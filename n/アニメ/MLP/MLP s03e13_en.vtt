<i>Morning in Ponyville shines</i>

00:16.130 --> 00:18.870
<i>And I know
For absolute certain</i>

00:19.360 --> 00:23.210
<i>That everything
Is certainly fine</i>

00:24.200 --> 00:27.660
<i>There's the mayor en route
To her office</i>

00:27.810 --> 00:30.460
<i>There's the sofa clerk
Selling some quills</i>

00:30.460 --> 00:31.380
Morning, kid!

00:31.500 --> 00:34.500
<i>My Ponyville
Is so gentle and still</i>

00:34.840 --> 00:38.660
<i>Can things ever go wrong?
I don't think that they will</i>

00:41.930 --> 00:45.130

00:45.280 --> 00:48.560

For absolute certain</i>

00:52.140 --> 00:54.390
<i>That everything is certainly...</i>

00:55.960 --> 00:58.260
Rainbow Dash! That's not funny!

00:58.410 --> 00:59.940
Terribly sorry, darling.

01:00.090 --> 01:03.110
I'm afraid I'm not good
with the thundery ones.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.080
Something tells me
everything is not going to be fine!

01:47.200 --> 01:50.170
What are you doing?
What happened to your cutie mark?

01:50.300 --> 01:52.120
Whatever do you mean, Twilight?

01:52.270 --> 01:55.420
I'm simply doing what I've done
since the day it first appeared.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.720
Does my sky look fabulous
or what?

02:00.980 --> 02:02.470
Too last season?

02:02.730 --> 02:06.270
Where is Rainbow Dash?
Why isn't she handling this?

02:08.560 --> 02:11.780
I still don't know
what you had to wake me up for.

02:11.940 --> 02:14.060
I love sleeping in the rain.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.040
It's not about the weather, Spike.

02:16.200 --> 02:20.270
Rarity had Rainbow Dash's cutie mark
and said this was Rainbow Dash's cottage.

02:21.140 --> 02:23.310
Something strange is going on.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.390
Hey, guys.

02:27.540 --> 02:30.310
Rainbow Dash!
Why is Rarity doing your job?

02:32.370 --> 02:35.100
And what in Equestria is going on in...

02:35.260 --> 02:36.730
here?!

02:38.050 --> 02:42.300
<i>These animals don't listen
No, not one little bit</i>

02:42.420 --> 02:46.380
<i>They run around out of control
And throw their hissy fits</i>

02:46.520 --> 02:50.170
<i>It's up to me to stop them
'Cause plainly you can see</i>

02:50.320 --> 02:53.120
<i>It's got to be my destiny</i>

02:53.270 --> 02:56.050
<i>And it's what
My cutie mark is telling me</i>

02:59.370 --> 03:03.430
<i>I try to keep them laughing
Put a smile upon their face</i>

03:03.580 --> 03:07.610
<i>But no matter what I try
It seems a bit of a disgrace</i>

03:07.760 --> 03:11.550
<i>I have to entertain them
It's there for all to see</i>

03:11.700 --> 03:14.950
<i>It's got to be my destiny</i>

03:15.100 --> 03:18.270
<i>And it's what
My cutie mark is telling me</i>

03:20.700 --> 03:25.010
<i>I don't care much for pickin' fruit
And plowin' fields ain't such a hoot</i>

03:25.160 --> 03:29.800
<i>No matter what I try
I cannot fix this busted water chute!</i>

03:30.080 --> 03:33.850
<i>I've got so many chores to do
It's no fun being me</i>

03:34.000 --> 03:36.750
<i>But it has to be my destiny</i>

03:36.900 --> 03:40.090
<i>'Cause it's what
My cutie mark is telling me</i>

03:43.320 --> 03:46.800
<i>Lookie here at what I made
I think that it's a dress</i>

03:47.250 --> 03:51.410
<i>I know it doesn't look like much
I'm under some distress</i>

03:51.540 --> 03:55.240
<i>Could y'all give me a hand here
And help me fix this mess?</i>

03:55.390 --> 03:57.820
<i>My destiny is not pretty</i>

03:58.230 --> 04:01.680
<i>But it's what
My cutie mark is tellin' me</i>

04:04.300 --> 04:08.650
<i>I'm in love with weather patterns
But the others have concerns</i>

04:08.800 --> 04:13.100
<i>For I just gave them frostbite
Over-top of their sunburns</i>

04:13.870 --> 04:17.660
<i>I have to keep on trying
For everyone can see</i>

04:17.800 --> 04:19.950
<i>It's got to be</i>

04:19.950 --> 04:22.050
<i>My destiny</i>

04:22.050 --> 04:24.300
<i>And it's what my cutie mark</i>

04:24.300 --> 04:26.070
<i>It's what my cutie mark</i>

04:26.070 --> 04:30.800
<i>Yes, it's what
My cutie mark is telling me!</i>

04:34.100 --> 04:36.700
This is bad.
This is very, very bad!

04:36.850 --> 04:39.360
What's going on?
Why is this happening?!

04:39.510 --> 04:42.270
Last night when you were taking
one of your seven-hour bubble baths,

04:42.420 --> 04:45.120
<i>I got a special delivery
from the princess.</i>

04:48.840 --> 04:50.370
Dear Twilight Sparkle,

04:50.520 --> 04:52.720
The spell contained
on the last page of this book

04:52.840 --> 04:56.470
is Star Swirl the Bearded's
secret unfinished masterpiece.

04:58.060 --> 05:01.550
He was never able to get it right,
and thus abandoned it.

05:01.700 --> 05:05.420
I believe you are the only pony
who can understand and rewrite it.

05:05.540 --> 05:07.340
Princess Celestia.

05:07.770 --> 05:10.410
From one to another,
another to one.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.850
A mark of one's destiny
singled out alone, fulfilled.

05:16.500 --> 05:20.100
That doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't even rhyme!

05:20.680 --> 05:23.440
<i>I cast the spell
so I could find out what it was.</i>

05:23.560 --> 05:25.570
<i>But nothing seemed to happen.</i>

05:26.280 --> 05:28.440
But now I know something did happen.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.020
The spell has changed
the Elements of Harmony!

05:31.140 --> 05:34.040
That must be why
their cutie marks are all wrong!

05:34.160 --> 05:36.430
So just cast a counter-spell
to switch them back!

05:36.980 --> 05:39.110
There is no counter-spell!

05:39.230 --> 05:42.340
What about that memory spell you used
to fix everypony when Discord was here?

05:42.460 --> 05:44.110
It's not their memories, Spike.

05:44.230 --> 05:46.400
It's their true selves
that have been altered!

05:46.590 --> 05:50.080
- Zecora's cure for the Cutie Pox?
- That won't work either...

05:51.260 --> 05:53.650
Well, maybe it won't be so bad.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.010
Maybe our friends will grow
to like their new lives?

05:56.130 --> 05:59.300
No Spike. They're not
who they are meant to be anymore.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.710
Their destinies are now changed.

06:01.830 --> 06:03.710
And it's all my fault...

06:12.170 --> 06:15.870
<i>I have to find a way</i>

06:16.100 --> 06:19.460
<i>To make this all okay</i>

06:20.120 --> 06:24.170
<i>I can't believe this small mistake</i>

06:24.320 --> 06:27.380
<i>Could've caused so much heartache</i>

06:27.530 --> 06:31.500
<i>Oh why</i>

06:31.650 --> 06:35.510
<i>Oh why</i>

06:35.660 --> 06:39.870
<i>Losing promise</i>

06:39.990 --> 06:43.270
<i>I don't know what to do</i>

06:43.850 --> 06:47.660
<i>Seeking answers</i>

06:47.790 --> 06:54.400
<i>I fear I won't get through to you</i>

06:55.490 --> 06:59.410
<i>Oh why</i>

06:59.660 --> 07:02.790
<i>Oh why</i>

07:05.640 --> 07:10.360
Oh, Spike, what have I done?

07:13.420 --> 07:17.320
Aw, come on, Twilight,
you'll figure out a way to fix this.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.610
These are your friends.

07:22.310 --> 07:23.620
You're right, Spike.

07:26.050 --> 07:28.790
And they mean more to me
than anything.

07:29.430 --> 07:31.710
My friends...

07:32.980 --> 07:35.420
Twilight?
Are you alright?

07:37.280 --> 07:39.430
I've got it! I know what to do!

07:39.550 --> 07:40.340
You do?

07:40.530 --> 07:43.410
I may not be able
to remind them of who they are,

07:43.530 --> 07:45.750
but I can show them
what they mean to each other.

07:45.870 --> 07:48.280
They'll find the part of themselves
that's been lost so they can

07:48.280 --> 07:50.750
help the friend
they care about so much!

07:50.870 --> 07:52.620
Come on, Spike!

07:55.930 --> 07:57.260
Fluttershy, wait!

07:59.360 --> 08:02.740
- Oh... Hey, Twilight...
- Where are you going?

08:02.860 --> 08:04.700
I'm moving back to Cloudsdale.

08:04.820 --> 08:08.450
I don't know what's wrong,
but I can't seem to make anypony laugh.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.110
Before you go,

08:13.230 --> 08:16.190
I was wondering if you might
be willing to help Rainbow Dash.

08:16.310 --> 08:18.670
She's really struggling
with her animals.

08:18.790 --> 08:23.130
But I don't really know
anything about animals...

08:23.250 --> 08:25.630
But you do know something
about Rainbow Dash.

08:26.940 --> 08:30.230
I know
that she's a true friend,

08:30.350 --> 08:33.630
and I'll do
anything I can to help her!

08:37.730 --> 08:38.990
Rainbow Dash!

08:39.110 --> 08:42.580
I'm in here! Help!
I'm trapped!

08:42.700 --> 08:46.200
Hurry, Twilight! Can't you do
some sort of spell to get her out?

08:46.320 --> 08:47.230
No.

08:47.350 --> 08:49.880
Fluttershy,
you're the only one who can help!

08:50.000 --> 08:52.490
Rainbow Dash needs you!

08:55.520 --> 08:57.610
Um... Hello?

08:57.730 --> 09:00.530
Little... woodland creatures?

09:03.020 --> 09:05.630
I know that
you're all very upset,

09:05.750 --> 09:07.970
and feel like giving
Rainbow Dash a hard time,

09:08.090 --> 09:11.310
but we'd all really appreciate it
if you'd calm down and, um,

09:11.430 --> 09:13.490
maybe rest for a bit?

09:15.880 --> 09:17.370
Oh! Uh... look!

09:17.490 --> 09:21.240
Here's some nice, juicy leaves
for you to munch on.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.470
And some crunchy,
munchy acorns too.

09:24.800 --> 09:28.830
Uh, wouldn't you like to take a break
and have a little snack?

09:31.330 --> 09:36.040
Aw, look at that. I guess you were
all just cranky because you were hungry.

09:37.570 --> 09:41.250
Oh, you are very welcome,
little friends.

09:43.230 --> 09:46.210
Goodness, it's like
I can understand them!

09:46.330 --> 09:48.810
I... I feel strange, like...

09:48.930 --> 09:52.830
like this is what I'm meant to do,
like this is who I am!

09:52.950 --> 09:54.670
My destiny!

10:02.270 --> 10:03.980
Wha... what happened?

10:04.100 --> 10:06.500
Fluttershy, look!
Your cutie mark!

10:09.160 --> 10:11.210
It worked!
It worked!

10:11.330 --> 10:13.670
Oh, I'm so happy
you're back to normal!

10:14.030 --> 10:15.400
Now, we need your help!

10:16.180 --> 10:20.420
<i>A true, true friend

10:38.730 --> 10:42.690

11:11.760 --> 11:14.290
There's no time to explain,
but we need your help.

11:14.410 --> 11:16.310
Applejack's trying to make dresses!

11:16.500 --> 11:18.710
Say no more!

Oh my, what a terrible dream I had.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.640
Or, maybe I'm still having it.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.580
Rarity, Pinkie Pie is about
to lose the apple farm.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.100
We need Applejack's help!

12:01.220 --> 12:03.080
Lose the apple farm?

12:03.180 --> 12:05.110
Well we can't let that happen,
now can we?

12:05.420 --> 12:08.750
<i>Pinkie Pie is in trouble</i>

12:08.870 --> 12:12.530
<i>We need to get there

12:12.940 --> 12:16.900
<i>We can try to do

Now that's more like it,
what's next?

12:42.800 --> 12:46.260
The townspeople are furious,
we need the old Pinkie Pie back.

12:46.380 --> 12:48.420
I'm on it, I know just the thing.

12:48.540 --> 12:52.040
<i>The townspeople need you
They've been sad for a while</i>

12:52.160 --> 12:56.280
<i>They march around, faces frown
And never seem to smile</i>

12:56.400 --> 13:01.340
<i>And if you feel like helping
We'd appreciate a lot</i>

13:01.460 --> 13:06.310
<i>If you get up there and spread

13:06.430 --> 13:09.780

13:40.810 --> 13:42.320
Wait a second, that's it!

13:42.440 --> 13:45.260
I understand now,
I know how to fix the spell!

13:50.190 --> 13:53.430
From all of us together,
together we are friends,

14:21.320 --> 14:22.910
What happened?

14:36.490 --> 14:41.220
Hello? Where am I?
What is this place?

14:44.880 --> 14:48.860
Congratulations, Twilight.
I knew you could do it.

14:48.980 --> 14:52.890
Princess! I don't understand.
What did I do?

14:53.010 --> 14:56.250
You did something today
that's never been done before.

14:56.370 --> 15:01.570
Something even a great unicorn like
Star Swirl the Bearded was not able to do.

15:01.690 --> 15:05.460
Because he did not understand
friendship like you do.

15:05.580 --> 15:09.750
The lessons you've learned here in Ponyville
have taught you well.

15:09.860 --> 15:12.820
You have proven that you're ready,
Twilight.

15:12.940 --> 15:15.920
Ready? Ready for what?

15:22.600 --> 15:28.570
<i>You've come such a long, long way</i>

15:28.570 --> 15:33.980
<i>And I've watched you
From that very first day</i>

15:34.100 --> 15:37.180
<i>To see how you might grow</i>

15:37.400 --> 15:39.740
<i>To see what you might do</i>

15:40.660 --> 15:42.490
<i>To see what you've been through</i>

15:42.570 --> 15:48.250
<i>And all the ways
You've made me proud of you</i>

15:52.420 --> 15:57.970
<i>It's time now
For a new change to come</i>

15:58.090 --> 16:04.560
<i>You've grown up
And your new life has begun</i>

16:04.680 --> 16:07.180
<i>To go where you will go</i>

16:07.300 --> 16:10.440
<i>To see what you will see</i>

16:10.560 --> 16:12.480
<i>To find what you will be</i>

16:12.600 --> 16:15.520
<i>For it's time for you</i>

16:15.640 --> 16:21.910
<i>To fulfill your destiny</i>

16:49.550 --> 16:52.480
Twilight...? Is that you?

16:59.710 --> 17:02.320
I... I've never seen
anything like it!

17:02.760 --> 17:05.590
Twilight's got wings! Awesome!

17:05.710 --> 17:07.950
A new flying buddy!

17:08.100 --> 17:12.240
Why, you've become an alicorn.
I didn't even know that was possible.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.820
Alicorn party!

17:17.670 --> 17:21.290
Wow... you look just like a princess!

17:21.410 --> 17:24.470
That's because she is a princess.

17:26.490 --> 17:28.460
Hold on a second!

17:33.740 --> 17:35.990
A princess?

17:36.440 --> 17:38.250
Since you've come to Ponyville,

17:38.370 --> 17:44.410
you've displayed the charity, compassion,
devotion, integrity, optimism,

17:44.530 --> 17:48.290
and of course,
the leadership of a true princess.

17:48.410 --> 17:51.370
But... does this mean
I won't be your student anymore?

17:51.490 --> 17:53.550
Not in the same way as before.

17:53.670 --> 17:58.700
I'll still be here to help and guide you,
but we're all your students now, too.

17:59.350 --> 18:03.140
You are an inspiration to us all,
Twilight.

18:06.510 --> 18:08.810
But... what do I do now?

18:08.940 --> 18:11.700
Is there a book about
being a princess I should read?

18:12.420 --> 18:15.520
There will be time
for all of that later.

18:23.840 --> 18:28.070
We are gathered here today
in celebration of a momentous occasion.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.480
My most faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle,

18:31.600 --> 18:35.470
has done many extraordinary things
since she's lived in Ponyville.

18:35.590 --> 18:40.420
She even helped reunite me
with my sister, Princess Luna.

18:40.540 --> 18:44.430
But today, Twilight Sparkle
did something extraordinary.

18:44.820 --> 18:47.500
She created new magic,

18:47.620 --> 18:50.060
proving without a doubt
that she is ready

18:50.060 --> 18:53.620
to be crowned
Equestria's newest princess.

18:54.040 --> 18:59.910
Fillies and gentlecolts,
may I present for the very first time,

18:59.910 --> 19:02.240
Princess Twilight Sparkle!

19:02.640 --> 19:05.910
<i>Thou Princess Twilight cometh</i>

19:06.060 --> 19:09.430
<i>Behold, behold</i>

19:09.550 --> 19:12.420
<i>A Princess here before us</i>

19:12.540 --> 19:19.340
<i>Behold, behold, behold</i>

19:19.460 --> 19:23.250
<i>Behold, behold
(behold, behold)</i>

19:23.370 --> 19:25.630
<i>The Princess Twilight cometh</i>

19:26.090 --> 19:30.300
<i>Behold, behold
(behold, behold)</i>

19:30.420 --> 19:33.210
<i>The Princess is
(the Princess is)</i>

19:33.210 --> 19:36.330
<i>Here!</i>

19:40.040 --> 19:42.120
Say something, Princess.

19:44.370 --> 19:45.890
A little while ago,

19:46.010 --> 19:50.300
my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia
sent me to live in Ponyville.

19:50.420 --> 19:52.760
She sent me to study friendship,

19:52.880 --> 19:56.220
which is something
I didn't really care much about.

19:56.340 --> 20:00.810
But now, on a day like today,
I can honestly say

20:00.930 --> 20:03.090
I wouldn't be standing here
if it weren't for the friendships

20:03.210 --> 20:05.220
I've made with all of you.

20:05.340 --> 20:09.190
Each one of you taught me something
about friendship, and for that,

20:09.310 --> 20:11.520
I will always be grateful.

20:11.640 --> 20:16.130
Today, I consider myself
the luckiest pony in Equestria.

20:16.270 --> 20:19.430
Thank you, friends.
Thank you, everypony!

20:25.250 --> 20:28.570
Twilight! I'm so proud of you!

20:29.360 --> 20:31.590
Are you crying?

20:31.710 --> 20:34.550
Of course not,
it's... it's liquid pride.

20:34.670 --> 20:36.510
Totally different thing!

20:38.880 --> 20:41.030
Way to go, Princess!

20:41.150 --> 20:43.350
Best coronation day ever!

20:43.470 --> 20:47.390
- We love you, Twilight.
- I love you too, girls!

20:55.900 --> 20:58.990
<i>The light in Equestria shimmers</i>

20:59.370 --> 21:02.910
<i>Life in Equestria shines</i>

21:03.030 --> 21:06.230
<i>And I know for absolute certain</i>

21:06.360 --> 21:09.550
<i>That everything</i>

21:09.670 --> 21:13.250
<i>Yes, everything</i>

21:13.370 --> 21:18.130
<i>Yes, everything is going to</i>

21:18.130 --> 21:21.120
<i>Be fine</i>

21:21.240 --> 21:25.430
<i>Yes, fine</i>

21:26.570 --> 21:29.990
Yes!
Everything's gonna be just fine!

21:31.917 --> 21:35.890
<i>A true, true friend
Helps a friend in need</i>

21:36.010 --> 21:40.000
<i>A friend will be there
To help them see</i>

21:40.120 --> 21:43.680
<i>A true, true friend
Helps a friend in need</i>

21:43.800 --> 21:47.890
<i>To see the light (to see the light)
That shines (that shines)</i>

21:48.010 --> 21:54.980
<i>From a true, true friend</i>
