00:04.066 --> 00:05.466
OK, Crusaders!

00:05.480 --> 00:07.857
Back to the business of
earnin' our Cutie Marks.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Any suggestions?

00:09.228 --> 00:11.170
No! We've tried everything!

00:11.400 --> 00:12.857
We've run out of ideas.

00:13.428 --> 00:16.914
Are you kiddin' me, Crusaders?
We can do better than that!

00:58.060 --> 00:59.320
What's wrong, Pip Squeak?

00:59.660 --> 01:02.080
I'm running for
Student Pony President!

01:02.080 --> 01:04.820
I was hoping you three would
be my campaign managers.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.730
We've never tried getting our
Cutie Marks in campaign managing

01:09.080 --> 01:10.720
What do you say, Crusaders?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.600
YEAH! HA!

01:58.080 --> 02:01.420
So, Pip? How would
you help the school

02:01.420 --> 02:04.580
if you were elected
Student Pony President?

02:04.890 --> 02:07.400
Our playground equipment
took quite a beating

02:07.400 --> 02:09.400
during Twilight's
battle with Tirek!

02:11.120 --> 02:13.500
If I'm voted in as
Student Pony President,

02:13.800 --> 02:16.400
I'll go to the School
Board and right this wrong!

02:16.637 --> 02:19.838
(cheers)

02:19.980 --> 02:22.920
Well, I think that's a
ridiculous waste of money.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.140
It's just like when Twist
proposed to repair the window

02:26.360 --> 02:27.620
that Discord destroyed.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.480
She just wanted
to repair it

02:29.480 --> 02:32.260
like a plain old
schoolhouse window!

02:33.000 --> 02:36.320
But you all know voting
for me was the best choice

02:36.500 --> 02:38.380
because I convinced
the School Board

02:38.380 --> 02:41.260
to give that window
visual appeal!

02:42.080 --> 02:44.960
'Course it doesn't hurt that
her mother, Spoiled Rich,

02:45.160 --> 02:47.220
is President of
the School Board!

02:47.730 --> 02:51.660
Exactly! Which is why when
Diamond Tiara is voted

02:51.660 --> 02:53.200
Student Pony President,

02:53.560 --> 02:55.660
the school will be
putting a statue of her

02:55.660 --> 02:58.140
in the center of our schoolyard!

02:59.040 --> 03:03.320
Silver Spoon! That was my big
announcement for when I won!

03:04.180 --> 03:05.860
I was only
trying to help.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.600
I don't need that
kind of help.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.400
Haven't we all had
enough of Diamond Tiara?

03:12.020 --> 03:14.520
Do we really need a
big statue of her?

03:14.790 --> 03:17.260
Especially where our playground
equipment should be?

03:22.330 --> 03:24.900
A vote for Pip is a
vote for the playground!

03:25.060 --> 03:30.080

06:42.280 --> 06:42.900
Huh?

06:45.320 --> 06:47.780
Oh, my gosh, Crusaders! Pip won!

06:47.960 --> 06:50.020
I couldn't have won
without the hard work

06:50.020 --> 06:53.400
of my campaign managers,
the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

06:53.580 --> 06:55.520
Campaign Manager Cutie Marks!

06:57.920 --> 07:01.340
Guess you're not as good as
you thought, Blank Flanks!

07:01.660 --> 07:04.160
In fact, I demand a recount!

07:04.320 --> 07:06.940
Trust me, Diamond
Tiara. Pip won.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.780
I'll be the judge of
that, Miss Cheerilee!

07:11.820 --> 07:13.180
WHAAAAAAAAT??!

07:13.740 --> 07:14.460
ONE VOTE?

07:15.020 --> 07:17.840
SILVER SPOON? YOU
didn't vote for me?

07:17.920 --> 07:19.220
No, I didn't!

07:19.780 --> 07:22.080
But you're my best friend!

07:22.480 --> 07:24.840
Am I? Cause I tried
to help by mentioning

07:24.840 --> 07:26.420
your "surprise statue"

07:26.720 --> 07:29.420
and suddenly I wasn't
even allowed to speak!

07:29.760 --> 07:31.700
You could have actually
won this election

07:31.800 --> 07:34.780
if you'd just listened to
me. You wanna know how?

07:35.500 --> 07:38.020
Sorry. I'm not
allowed to speak.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.360
What? I don't have to
follow her drama anymore.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.120
I know Diamond Tiara's
been pretty awful,

07:49.120 --> 07:51.660
but we should probably
make sure she's OK.

07:52.020 --> 07:54.680
Just 'cause she's never cared
about anypony else's feelings

07:54.960 --> 07:56.780
doesn't mean we shouldn't
care about hers.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.940
Diamond Tiara, why are
you making that face?

08:06.160 --> 08:08.600
That is not the
face of a winner.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.200
Because I didn't win.

08:12.540 --> 08:16.160
What? You mean I hefted
all these party supplies

08:16.160 --> 08:17.540
to celebrate nothing?

08:19.000 --> 08:19.880
Sorry, Mother.

08:20.180 --> 08:24.380
It's bad enough you lost to that
transplant from Trottingham.

08:24.580 --> 08:28.400
But imagine if you'd lost to
one of those Blank Flanks!

08:29.060 --> 08:33.500
As a rich pony, you must always
think of your social standing!

08:35.660 --> 08:39.740
That starts here in Ponyville
and reaches all over Equestria.

08:40.060 --> 08:43.140

10:28.460 --> 10:31.740
If it is, then
I'm weird too.

10:32.100 --> 10:35.060
She wants to change, but
she doesn't know how.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.980
Seems like she could
use a friend or two

10:36.980 --> 10:38.100
to help her figure it out.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.380
Hey, Diamond Tiara! Wait up!

10:48.000 --> 10:51.380
What do you three want? To
gloat? Rub in my defeat?

10:51.900 --> 10:54.700
Actually, we wanted to
invite you to our clubhouse

10:54.700 --> 10:55.440
to hang out.

10:56.460 --> 10:57.460
Really?

10:58.180 --> 10:59.250
Yeah. For real.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.400
Well, thanks to you all,

11:01.400 --> 11:04.280
I don't have any important Class
President business to attend to

11:04.280 --> 11:07.320
or anything. So,
I might as well.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.360
That sounds like a yes.

11:12.260 --> 11:16.180
So, do you three just sit around
here plotting out different ways

11:16.180 --> 11:18.060
to try and get your Cutie Marks?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.060
Actually, yeah.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.980
You three are...really lucky.

11:25.980 --> 11:26.980
We are?

11:27.220 --> 11:30.780
Yeah. You get to explore
all these options,

11:31.020 --> 11:32.360
learning who you really are

11:32.360 --> 11:35.440
before you're stuck with
something you don't understand.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.740
But you've done that, right?

11:39.700 --> 11:42.340
Yeah! Cause I have
my Cutie Mark!

11:42.480 --> 11:44.780
And I'm not struggling
at all to figure out

11:44.780 --> 11:47.700
who I'm supposed to be and
what I'm supposed to be doing

11:47.700 --> 11:50.640
with this mark that's
already on my flank.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.460
Uh, are you sure about that?

11:54.280 --> 11:56.320
That's a weird question.

11:56.940 --> 11:59.660
Not really since we kind of
overheard you yesterday.

12:00.780 --> 12:03.980
Were you trying to get
your Cutie Mark in spying?

12:04.100 --> 12:06.020
Is that on your little chart?

12:06.560 --> 12:09.440
No! We were just worried about
you when you lost the election

12:09.440 --> 12:11.920
and then you lost your friend
and then your mom yelled at you.

12:12.180 --> 12:14.260
We know you wanna change
and we think we can...

12:14.260 --> 12:16.480
HEEEEELP!

12:16.740 --> 12:18.030
Cutie Mark Crusaders!

12:18.480 --> 12:20.900
I was at the School Board
Meeting and they didn't approve

12:20.900 --> 12:23.420
my request for the new
playground equipment.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.640
Why not?

12:24.800 --> 12:26.700
There's no money in the budget!

12:26.840 --> 12:29.660
So I checked my Peggy Bank
to see if I had enough bits,

12:30.080 --> 12:33.110
but my little Peggy wasn't
nearly full enough.

12:33.560 --> 12:34.520
Don't worry, Pip!

12:34.600 --> 12:35.780
We'll meet you back at school!

12:35.780 --> 12:37.400
And help you find a solution!

12:37.860 --> 12:39.540
Thanks, Cutie Mark Crusaders!

12:40.620 --> 12:43.600
Oh, I already
have a solution.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.320

Everypony! I have
an announcement!

14:50.620 --> 14:51.600
Diamond Tiara!

14:51.880 --> 14:54.380
Think hard about the choice
your makin' right now!

14:54.500 --> 14:56.240
You can be a
better pony!

14:57.120 --> 14:58.160
Diamond Tiara!

14:59.720 --> 15:02.600
I just happen to be here
for the School Board Meeting

15:02.600 --> 15:06.580
and this is what I see when
we adjourn? My daughter

15:06.580 --> 15:09.640
associating with confused,
insignificant, low-lifes?

15:09.860 --> 15:12.960
Socializing with their
kind is not how you move up

15:12.960 --> 15:15.600
in Equestria! Come,
Diamond Tiara!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.240
No, Mother!

15:18.860 --> 15:20.040
Excuse me?

15:20.480 --> 15:23.260
You've spent your life
acting like a high horse

15:23.480 --> 15:25.920
and raised me to follow
in your hoofprints.

15:26.060 --> 15:27.740
At first, I thought
this was fine,

15:28.140 --> 15:32.020
but then I finally realized I
wanted something you don't have,

15:32.340 --> 15:33.160
FRIENDS!

15:36.800 --> 15:38.060
That's enough,
Diamond Tiara!

15:38.360 --> 15:40.400
Step away from
those BLANK FLANKS!

15:40.700 --> 15:42.560
These are the Cutie
Mark Crusaders

15:42.860 --> 15:44.360
and they are my friends!

15:44.920 --> 15:48.460
You need to stop calling them
such mean and hurtful names.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.960
They are working harder
to get their Cutie Marks

15:50.960 --> 15:52.980
than anypony I've ever seen.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.840
And they will get them
exactly when they discover

15:55.840 --> 15:59.490
their true talent, which I
guarantee will be amazing!

15:59.960 --> 16:02.980
Now, will you please
deliver this to Father?

16:04.080 --> 16:06.300
Yes, of course, dear.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.320
I have to thank
you, Crusaders.

16:10.540 --> 16:12.600
Obviously, I've known
since I got my Cutie Mark

16:12.600 --> 16:15.320
that my talent is getting other
ponies to do what I want.

16:15.700 --> 16:18.380
I just asked my father if
he could donate the money

16:18.380 --> 16:20.380
for the new
playground equipment.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.680
I know you were worried
for a second there, weren't you?

16:25.980 --> 16:29.040
Huh, well, I think it's all
going to work out just fine,

16:29.040 --> 16:30.550

Hey there, you with
the amazing strength?

16:52.280 --> 16:54.880
Can you help them move that
merry-go-round across the lawn?

16:55.260 --> 16:56.610
Thank you so much!

16:56.900 --> 16:58.580
And you with the Super Teeth...

16:58.840 --> 17:00.750
We need you to help
with that teeter-totter!

17:46.460 --> 17:47.980
I've been thinkin', Crusaders.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.000
We spend an awful lot of
time fussin' and frettin',

17:51.000 --> 17:52.840
tryin' to discover
our true talent.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.000
But when we take
a little time off,

17:55.320 --> 17:58.460
we end up helpin' other ponies
figure out their true talent.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.300
Yeah, and I think that's
way more important

18:01.300 --> 18:03.640
than worrying about our
Cutie Marks, don't you?

18:04.000 --> 18:07.320
Absolutely! I don't care
if I ever get my Cutie Mark

18:07.460 --> 18:10.380
as long as I get to hang
out with my best friends.

18:11.180 --> 18:12.720
So, whaddaya say, Crusaders?

18:13.100 --> 18:16.180
Wanna just focus on helping
others find their Cutie Marks?

18:16.700 --> 18:17.460
YEAH!

18:35.560 --> 18:36.360
What happened!

18:36.460 --> 18:37.260
What's going on?

18:37.680 --> 18:42.120
