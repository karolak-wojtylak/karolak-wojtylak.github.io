00:14.916 --> 00:16.515
Thank you, little squirrel.

00:16.515 --> 00:20.455
But remember, these flowers
are for Princess Celestia.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.890
Only the prettiest ones will do.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.166
Hellooo, little guy.

00:41.466 --> 00:44.769
I've never seen anything like you before.

00:46.342 --> 00:48.555
Oh! Are you hungry?

00:50.695 --> 00:51.982
Here you go.

00:56.435 --> 00:58.575
I guess you *were* hungry.

01:04.158 --> 01:07.142
You're the cuuutest thing ever!

01:07.322 --> 01:09.975
I can't wait to show you to my friends.

01:52.739 --> 01:54.423
Oh! Hurry up, Spike!

01:54.423 --> 01:56.271
This place isn't gonna clean itself!

01:56.456 --> 01:58.833
It also didn't mess itself up.

01:59.171 --> 02:01.467
Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!

02:01.785 --> 02:04.439
I thought this was just an unofficial, casual visit.

02:04.439 --> 02:07.011
There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty!

02:07.011 --> 02:10.534
I want this place to be spotless.
And you've barely made a dent in the clutter!

02:10.677 --> 02:14.235
Maybe you should...
start reading them... one at a time!

02:16.682 --> 02:19.734
Everything's got to be perfect.
No time for fooling around!

02:20.201 --> 02:22.512
You know, this would be an awful lot easier...

02:22.512 --> 02:24.982
...if there weren't two of us here
getting under each other's feet.

02:25.361 --> 02:29.055
Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how
everyone else's preparations are coming.

02:29.118 --> 02:30.188
Or maybe I should...?

02:46.626 --> 02:48.219
What happened to the rest of her name?

02:48.442 --> 02:50.458
We couldn't fit it all in.

02:50.458 --> 02:53.146
You can't hang a banner that says
"Welcome Princess Celest".

02:53.146 --> 02:54.754
Take it down and try again.

02:59.292 --> 03:01.927
That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.

03:10.776 --> 03:13.458
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.
How's the banquet coming?

03:14.713 --> 03:16.999
It would be coming a little better if...

03:25.477 --> 03:27.940
Pinkie! What are you doing?!

03:28.194 --> 03:30.591
Those sweets are supposed to be for the Princess!

03:30.591 --> 03:32.913
I-I know. That's why I'm tasting them.

03:32.913 --> 03:38.039
Somepony needs to make sure that everything
is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue.

03:38.201 --> 03:43.431
And I, Pinkie Pie, declare that
these treats are fit for a king!

03:43.611 --> 03:46.129
Or a queen! Or a princess!

03:47.261 --> 03:49.908
Twilight! Pinkie! You won't believe...!

03:51.286 --> 03:54.791
Oh. I'm sorry. Uh... Am I interrupting?

03:55.110 --> 03:57.735
No, not at all. Come on in
and make yourself at home.

04:00.587 --> 04:02.083
What's going on, Fluttershy?

04:02.083 --> 04:05.834
You won't believe what I found
at the edge of the Everfree Forest.

04:06.515 --> 04:09.552
Come on out, little guy. It's okay.

04:13.037 --> 04:14.299
Three?

04:14.615 --> 04:17.626
They're amazing! What are they?

04:17.984 --> 04:22.446
I'm not sure. I'm also not sure
where these other two came from.

04:22.695 --> 04:26.081
I'll take one off your hoofs.
I've never seen anything so...

04:26.475 --> 04:28.414
...ADORABLE!

04:30.006 --> 04:32.180
Besides, it'll be nice to have
a companion for Spike...

04:32.180 --> 04:34.315
...so won't bother me so much
while I'm studying.

04:34.971 --> 04:36.831
Pinkie, do you want the other one?

04:37.203 --> 04:39.972
Ugh! A parasprite? Are you kidding?

04:41.065 --> 04:42.893
-Ugh?
-A para-what?

04:42.893 --> 04:44.606
How could you not like...

04:45.094 --> 04:47.066
Now I gotta go find a trombone!

04:47.953 --> 04:49.030
A what?

04:49.328 --> 04:51.004
A trombone. You know...

04:53.756 --> 04:54.888
Typical Pinkie.

04:58.934 --> 05:01.157
[Stand still, Rainbow Dash.]

05:01.885 --> 05:04.908
I can't! I need to fly!

05:04.908 --> 05:07.837
This is way too boring for me.

05:07.837 --> 05:11.149
Do you want to look nice
for Princess Celestia or not?

05:13.533 --> 05:17.515
Wow! Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous!

05:17.881 --> 05:19.542
Hm, thank you, Twilight.

05:19.542 --> 05:22.369
Nice to know *someone* appreciates my talents.

05:23.618 --> 05:25.872
Sooo boooring.

05:27.348 --> 05:28.169
Huh?

05:28.403 --> 05:30.077
What's that sound, Twilight?

05:35.173 --> 05:37.132
Wow! What are they?

05:37.233 --> 05:39.767
The better question is: where did they come from?

05:39.767 --> 05:41.669
I only had one a minute ago.

05:41.769 --> 05:43.138
Uh, I'll take one!

05:43.366 --> 05:45.730
Me too. Oh, they're perfect!

05:46.463 --> 05:48.684
Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?

05:49.830 --> 05:53.086
Girls! Hello! This is important!

05:53.507 --> 05:55.068
Durgh! Thanks a lot!

06:04.641 --> 06:07.420
Oh, the decorations... the banquet...

06:07.420 --> 06:10.398
I really hope everything comes
together in time for tomorrow.

06:20.396 --> 06:21.966
What's there to worry about?

06:37.859 --> 06:38.591
Spike!

06:40.320 --> 06:42.189
Wake up! What happened?!

06:44.689 --> 06:45.770
What's going on?

06:46.739 --> 06:48.188
Where did they come from?

06:48.188 --> 06:52.153
I don't know. The little guy got hungry
in the night, so I gave him a snack, but...

06:52.153 --> 06:54.557
...I have no idea where these others came from.

06:56.646 --> 06:59.288
Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!

07:02.923 --> 07:05.081
The Princess will be here in a few hours!

07:10.217 --> 07:12.441
Spike! Help me round up these little guys!

07:13.835 --> 07:16.399
What does it... look like I'm... doing?

07:21.213 --> 07:24.086
I know, I know. "Stop fooling around."

07:47.451 --> 07:48.626
Get off me!

08:03.052 --> 08:05.494
Not only are you adorable...

08:05.494 --> 08:07.500
...but you're also quite useful.

08:09.912 --> 08:11.802
Oh! Are you okay?

08:14.587 --> 08:16.502
Eeew!

08:19.879 --> 08:21.427
Gross, gross, gross!

08:21.491 --> 08:25.222
No creature that behaves so revoltingly
is allowed in my boutique!

08:31.472 --> 08:33.716
Look, Rarity! Applejack lent me a harmonica!

08:35.105 --> 08:36.210
Isn't that great?

08:37.933 --> 08:39.021
And not a moment too soon.

08:40.022 --> 08:42.143
Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.

08:42.143 --> 08:44.990
And I'm not?! You know how many
more instruments I've gotta find?

08:44.990 --> 08:46.288
A lot! That's how many.

08:46.601 --> 08:49.656
Now if we split the list between us,
we might just make it in time.

08:50.056 --> 08:53.703
Please, Pinkie! I don't have time
for some silly scavenger hunt.

08:53.703 --> 08:55.446
I've got a real problem.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.355
You've got a real problem, all right.

08:57.394 --> 09:00.069
And a banjo is the only answer!

09:06.261 --> 09:08.052
I see we've having the same problem.

09:08.241 --> 09:09.097
Get out!

09:12.188 --> 09:14.236
Fluttershy knows everything about animals.

09:14.236 --> 09:17.008
I'm sure she can tell us how to
stop them from multiplying.

09:21.345 --> 09:22.354
Or not.

09:25.142 --> 09:27.774
Do something, Fluttershy! Can't you control them?

09:28.124 --> 09:29.338
I've tried everything I know.

09:29.338 --> 09:33.078
I've tried begging and pleading
and beseeching and asking politely and...

09:47.857 --> 09:50.533
If we can't get them under control
before the Princess arrives...

09:50.533 --> 09:52.365
...it'll be a total disaster!

09:53.486 --> 09:54.522
EEEW!

09:54.529 --> 09:57.193
If you ask me, it's already a total disaster!

09:57.883 --> 09:59.837
Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy!

10:00.087 --> 10:02.469
But I still can't figure why ya need so many.

10:03.225 --> 10:03.982
Hey!

10:04.532 --> 10:05.572
What do we do?

10:06.135 --> 10:07.061
I got it!

10:07.323 --> 10:09.374
Nopony can herd like Applejack!

10:09.892 --> 10:12.417
Yeah! We can drive them back into the forest!

10:12.794 --> 10:15.607
I'll rustle 'em up, but I need
everypony's help to do it.

10:16.060 --> 10:18.114
Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there.

10:18.114 --> 10:20.393
I'll herd the little critters
straight at ya like a funnel.

10:20.974 --> 10:23.708
Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy
stay on top of 'em.

10:23.708 --> 10:25.103
Don't let 'em fly away.

10:25.103 --> 10:26.223
Aye, aye!

10:26.979 --> 10:28.751
YEEHAW!

10:44.631 --> 10:47.339
All right, y'all. Here goes nothin'!

10:48.009 --> 10:50.475
Look out, Rarity!
That one's fixin' on gettin' away!

10:50.756 --> 10:52.564
Keep a lean on 'em, Rainbow Dash!

10:54.413 --> 10:56.841
Hold on, girls. We're almost there!

10:57.547 --> 10:58.367
Pinkie!

10:58.367 --> 11:00.415
Twilight! We don't have much time.

11:00.415 --> 11:03.439
You're telling me? The Princess
could arrive at any moment.

11:03.439 --> 11:06.587
Exactly! That's why I need you, girls,
to drop what you're doing...

11:06.587 --> 11:08.592
...and help me find some maracas!

11:08.974 --> 11:09.896
Maracas?

11:09.896 --> 11:13.012
Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas!

11:13.578 --> 11:14.496
You're right!

11:14.496 --> 11:16.914
Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal.

11:17.015 --> 11:17.839
Follow me!

11:19.789 --> 11:21.493
I said: follow me!

11:21.587 --> 11:22.690
Pinkie Pie...

11:22.774 --> 11:25.642
...you are so random.

11:26.016 --> 11:28.162
Ugh, you are also stubborn!

11:28.951 --> 11:30.271
Forget her, ladies.

11:30.381 --> 11:33.114
Focus! Head 'em up and move 'em out.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.385
Alright!

11:44.040 --> 11:44.977
Ouch.

11:45.210 --> 11:47.800
We did it! Nice work, Applejack.

11:48.498 --> 11:50.369
Couldn't have done it without y'all.

11:50.369 --> 11:53.874
Now let's get back and clean up the mess
they made before the Princess arrives.

11:55.002 --> 11:57.194
Okay. Everyone knows what to do, right?

11:57.194 --> 12:00.058
We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.

12:05.317 --> 12:07.097
Where did *they* come from?

12:07.373 --> 12:10.692
Well... I may have kept just one.

12:13.959 --> 12:16.534
I couldn't help myself. They're just...

12:16.881 --> 12:18.805
...so cute.

12:19.055 --> 12:21.316
We don't have time to
keep rounding up these things!

12:21.573 --> 12:22.639
What do we do now?

12:22.988 --> 12:25.203
We call in the weather patrol!

12:30.548 --> 12:33.857
Time to take out the adorable trash.

12:34.030 --> 12:36.221
YAAA!!!

12:53.650 --> 12:55.094
Way to go, Rainbow Dash!

12:55.285 --> 12:57.499
Looks like our problems are solved.

12:57.721 --> 12:59.537
They will be with these cymbals!

13:00.641 --> 13:02.570
Hey! Gimme those back!

13:09.417 --> 13:13.223
I can't hold it! She's breaking up!

13:21.356 --> 13:24.445
Pinkie Pie! What have you done!?

13:24.753 --> 13:27.568
I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals,
that's what I've done!

13:28.235 --> 13:31.264
Will you forget about your
silly instruments for one second?

13:31.264 --> 13:33.993
You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville!

13:34.093 --> 13:36.209
Me?! Ruin?!

13:36.209 --> 13:39.189
I'm not the ruiner. I am the ruinee!

13:39.701 --> 13:41.272
Or is it ruiness?

13:41.700 --> 13:42.685
Ruinette?

13:43.153 --> 13:46.196
Come on, girls!
There's no reasonin' with that one.

13:46.196 --> 13:48.173
She's a few apples short of a bushel.

13:48.745 --> 13:53.503
Hey! I'm trying to tell you all
that the ruining is on the other hoof!

13:53.688 --> 13:55.913
If you just slowed down and LISTENED TO ME...!

14:20.256 --> 14:23.276
What do we do?
They're eating all the food in town.

14:23.916 --> 14:25.146
My apples!

14:25.951 --> 14:27.515
We've gotta do something!

14:29.209 --> 14:32.908
I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them
stop eating all the food.

14:46.580 --> 14:49.218
Look! Tambourines! If you could all just...!

15:12.646 --> 15:16.570
Hey! It worked. They're not
eating the food anymore.

15:18.324 --> 15:21.197
Oh no. If they get inside my store...

15:21.357 --> 15:24.191
EVERYPONY FOR HERSELF!

15:28.786 --> 15:30.130
MY OUTFITS!

15:34.502 --> 15:37.632
Go on! Shoo! Get out! Naughty, naughty!

15:45.328 --> 15:46.668
I'll save you!

15:58.413 --> 16:01.625
No woodland creature's gonna
eat the Apple family's crop!

16:04.762 --> 16:06.112
Brace yourself, y'all!

16:06.271 --> 16:07.535
Here they come!

16:20.409 --> 16:21.749
Didn't see that one comin'.

16:25.344 --> 16:26.426
Help!

16:31.097 --> 16:33.047
They're eating the words!

16:40.463 --> 16:41.280
Help.

16:50.316 --> 16:51.765
Have you gone mad?

16:52.842 --> 16:55.656
Zecora! These little guys
are devouring Ponyville!

16:55.656 --> 16:59.036
And the Princess is on her way!
Can you help us? Please?

16:59.495 --> 17:02.926
Oh, monster of so little size.

17:02.926 --> 17:05.794
Is that a parasprite before my eyes?

17:05.794 --> 17:07.345
I don't know! Is it?

17:08.667 --> 17:11.778
Tales of crops and harvests consumed.

17:11.778 --> 17:14.658
If these creatures are in Ponyville...

17:15.435 --> 17:16.530
...you're doomed.

17:23.941 --> 17:26.008
Oh no! Here she comes!

17:37.991 --> 17:39.472
Okay. Here's the plan.

17:39.472 --> 17:41.324
Rainbow Dash, you distract them.

17:43.385 --> 17:46.858
Good! Everyone else, we need to build
an exact copy of Ponyville right over there.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.525
We've got less than a minute.

17:51.931 --> 17:53.991
Zecora was right. We're doomed.

17:54.953 --> 17:58.923
Oh no. The Princess's procession
is here. It's all over!

18:06.800 --> 18:09.533
Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here.

18:09.533 --> 18:10.966
This is no time for your...

18:11.883 --> 18:13.288
...nonsense?

18:35.458 --> 18:36.444
Look!

18:46.820 --> 18:49.138
Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil!

18:49.138 --> 18:50.727
Hello, Princess!

18:50.990 --> 18:54.021
So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.

18:59.979 --> 19:03.174
So... How was the trip? Hit much traffic?

19:05.038 --> 19:06.206
What is this?

19:09.401 --> 19:11.593
These creatures are adorable!

19:11.604 --> 19:13.677
They're not *that* adorable.

19:14.439 --> 19:18.053
I'm terribly honored that you
and the good citizens of Ponyville...

19:18.053 --> 19:20.733
...have organized a parade in honor of my visit.

19:20.776 --> 19:24.636
Parade? Oh! Yes! The parade!

19:24.636 --> 19:28.823
Unfortunately that visit is going to
have to wait for another time.

19:28.823 --> 19:32.056
I'm afraid an emergency has
come up in Fillydelphia.

19:32.056 --> 19:35.611
Apparently there's been some sort of infestation.

19:35.611 --> 19:37.593
An... infestation?

19:37.593 --> 19:42.959
Yes. A swarm of incredibly bothersome
creatures has invaded the poor town.

19:43.259 --> 19:47.461
I'm sorry, Twilight, to have to
put you all through so much trouble.

19:47.461 --> 19:49.777
Trouble? Oh... What trouble?

19:50.061 --> 19:51.596
Before I have to go...

19:51.596 --> 19:55.657
...would you care to give me your latest report
on the magic of friendship in person?

19:56.031 --> 19:57.741
My... report?

19:57.956 --> 19:59.962
Haven't you learned anything about friendship?

20:04.460 --> 20:06.346
Actually, I have.

20:06.771 --> 20:11.314
I've learned that sometimes the solution to your
problems can come from where you least expect it.

20:11.677 --> 20:15.759
It's a good idea to stop and listen to
your friends' opinions and perspectives.

20:18.174 --> 20:20.652
Even when they don't always seem to make sense.

20:21.238 --> 20:23.564
I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle.

20:23.564 --> 20:25.982
And I'm very impressed with your friends as well.

20:25.982 --> 20:29.143
It sounds like you're all learning
so much from each other.

20:29.143 --> 20:30.721
Thank you, Princess.

20:36.916 --> 20:39.078
Hey! What happened to the Princess?

20:39.078 --> 20:40.498
Emergency in Fillydelphia.

20:40.498 --> 20:43.333
Some sort of "infestation".

20:43.333 --> 20:46.113
Oh no! Have they got parasprites too?!

20:46.113 --> 20:48.656
Well, have tuba, will travel.

20:49.137 --> 20:51.383
I think the Princess can handle it.

20:51.383 --> 20:55.069
So you knew what those critters
were all along, huh, Pinkie Pie?

20:55.069 --> 20:59.688
Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic
to get my hooves on all these instruments?

20:59.688 --> 21:01.282
I tried to tell you.

21:01.282 --> 21:04.107
We know, Pinkie Pie.
And we're sorry we didn't listen.

21:06.744 --> 21:08.022
You're a great friend.

21:08.248 --> 21:10.863
Even if we don't always understand you.

21:10.863 --> 21:13.373
Thanks, guys. You're all great friends too.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.154
Even when I don't understand me.

21:15.290 --> 21:17.930
You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia!

21:17.930 --> 21:21.256
And more importantly, you saved Ponyville!

21:25.034 --> 21:26.003
Or not.

21:30.207 --> 21:33.707
