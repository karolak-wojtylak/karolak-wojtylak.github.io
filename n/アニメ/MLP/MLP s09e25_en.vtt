00:09.210 --> 00:11.243
Luna: You wanted to boost
Twilight's confidence,

00:11.345 --> 00:13.812
so you brought back Chrysalis,
Cozy Glow, and Tirek

00:13.914 --> 00:15.046
to attack her!?

00:15.916 --> 00:17.549
Discord was Grogar!?

00:17.651 --> 00:19.018
You've been setting up
challenges for us

00:19.120 --> 00:20.586

haven't you!

00:20.688 --> 00:21.587
My bad.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.156
<i> The ultimate battle for the</i>

complete DESTRUCTION!

Won't that be FUN?

01:16.009 --> 01:17.776
Chrysalis:
Patience, Cozy.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.112
Destruction
is so... permanent.

01:21.214 --> 01:22.948
We need to show the
rest of Equestria

01:23.050 --> 01:25.317
that we've broken
their heroes first.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.653
Besides, we should have
fun with our guests.

01:28.855 --> 01:32.090
No! We should hunt
down Twilight Sparkle.

01:32.192 --> 01:34.859
As long as she's out
there, she's dangerous.

01:34.961 --> 01:37.128
Is that big
<i>strong</i> minotaur

01:37.230 --> 01:40.732
THAT scared of
one little pony? Relax!

01:40.834 --> 01:43.268
It's not like her friends
are going anywhere..

01:45.438 --> 01:48.306
The fools brought the remains
of my throne to Canterlot

01:48.408 --> 01:49.741
to protect themselves!

01:50.844 --> 01:52.844
Those shards block
their magic.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.282
Careful. Too close and the
shards cancel even our powers.

01:58.151 --> 01:59.784
But on THIS side
of the cavern,

01:59.886 --> 02:02.921
we're the most powerful
beings in Equestria,

02:03.323 --> 02:08.259
thanks to Grogar's Bell.
Isn't that right... GROGAR?

02:12.632 --> 02:14.299
WHAT are you doing!?

02:14.701 --> 02:15.967
You saw what happened

02:16.069 --> 02:18.469
when you tried to take
Discord's chaos magic.

02:18.671 --> 02:21.539
Yeah, but there's
alicorn princess magic

02:21.641 --> 02:23.475
in there now too!

02:23.677 --> 02:26.344
I could be sooo much more
powerful if I just could have..

02:26.446 --> 02:29.080
What do you mean
YOU could be?

02:29.182 --> 02:32.851
Um hello, I'm the best one out
of all of us, nobody sees me--

02:32.953 --> 02:36.154
-What are you talking about!?
-The best at what!?

02:36.356 --> 02:38.389
This is really bad!

02:39.091 --> 02:40.391
We gotta find Twilight.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.860
She's probably already
figured out some way

02:41.962 --> 02:43.228
to defeat those monsters.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.231
Any idea HOW we get
out of here to do that?

02:48.735 --> 02:49.934
Too sticky.

02:50.036 --> 02:52.670
There's no way anypony
could get through this.

02:52.972 --> 02:54.840
Discord: I'm so sorry.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.408
It made so much
sense in my head.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.778
Twilight defeats
her worst enemies

02:59.880 --> 03:01.746
and is filled
with confidence.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.049
I truly did have
the best intentions.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.317
I swear I'll make
it up to you.

03:06.653 --> 03:10.222
THAT'S gonna need to be
a pretty EPIC make up.

03:10.324 --> 03:13.425
STAY AWAY FROM THE
BELL, YOU PEST!

03:13.827 --> 03:16.461
NONE of us can use
the alicorn's magic

03:16.563 --> 03:18.197

out how to handle

03:18.299 --> 03:21.466

chaos magic!

03:21.568 --> 03:24.103
Discord: I could
always<i> tell</i> you how...

03:24.505 --> 03:28.206
It would give you
power over all reality.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.842
But you'd have
to ask nicely...

03:30.944 --> 03:32.277
AND spare my friends.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.980
No, Discord! This
isn't the way to help!

03:35.849 --> 03:38.716

03:38.818 --> 03:41.620
Threats are more
my speed. SPEAK!

03:41.822 --> 03:45.023
He's lying! He
won't tell us.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.426
I certainly
won't tell YOU

03:47.528 --> 03:50.762
after the way you lied to
ME last time we teamed up,

03:51.064 --> 03:53.132
you musclebound cretin.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.467
This "cretin"
could destroy you

03:55.569 --> 03:59.237
before you blink so choose
your words carefully.

03:59.439 --> 04:02.407
You're right. "Cretin"
is too polite.

04:02.509 --> 04:05.611
How about 'pathetic
centaur who uses magic

04:05.713 --> 04:08.680
to compensate for the fact
that deep down he's afraid

04:08.782 --> 04:09.781
he'll never be enough

Twilight pronto.
