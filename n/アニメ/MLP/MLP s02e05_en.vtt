WEBVTT

00:03.267 --> 00:07.995
Oh... Are those sweet...
carrot pancakes I smell?

00:08.416 --> 00:11.205
Mmm... How divine.

00:11.854 --> 00:16.219
The aroma... spiced warm apple cider.

00:16.948 --> 00:21.725
Ah. And the smell of... smoke.

00:22.550 --> 00:24.608
Smoke? Smoke?!

00:25.878 --> 00:27.535
SMOOOUUARGH!

00:29.465 --> 00:31.000
Rarity!

00:31.969 --> 00:35.283
You've ruined the surprise.
I was gonna serve you breakfast in bed.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.735
Well, g'mornin', Rarity.

01:21.736 --> 01:24.225
Father! Mother!

01:24.450 --> 01:25.939
I'll have you know that
Sweetie Belle here...

01:25.940 --> 01:27.974
...cooked this yummy lookin'
breakfast all on her own.

01:30.501 --> 01:32.247
I... figured.

01:34.186 --> 01:36.720
I didn't know you could burn juice.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.296
I've been giving her lessons.

01:38.297 --> 01:41.196
I wouldn't be surprised if she's
got a cutie mark in fancy cooking...

01:41.197 --> 01:43.453
...by the time we get back
from our vacation.

01:43.454 --> 01:45.332
Vacation? Is that this week?

01:45.333 --> 01:47.777
As in... starting-this-very-instant this week?

01:50.152 --> 01:52.424
Let me guess. Apple sauce?

01:52.695 --> 01:54.493
Nope! Toast.

01:55.023 --> 01:58.576
We're gonna have the bestest time
two sisters could even have.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.953
I'm gonna go grab my stuff
from dad's wagon.

02:02.698 --> 02:05.614
So... now when you say "a week"...

02:05.615 --> 02:08.538
Is that... seven whole days?

02:08.539 --> 02:10.725
And six night, I know.

02:10.726 --> 02:13.108
Such a short time to spend
with your lil' sis.

02:13.255 --> 02:14.338
You gonna eat that?

02:14.877 --> 02:17.298
But I've got such a long to-do list.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.971
Oh, well. I suppose
"spend time with your sister"...

02:20.972 --> 02:23.323
...will just have to
be added to the list.

02:26.168 --> 02:27.634
Just a few necessities.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.649
Now let's get that
kitchen all cleaned up.

02:35.883 --> 02:39.139
Cleaned up? But we
haven't even eaten yet.

02:39.181 --> 02:40.402
Well now, Sweetie Belle.

02:40.403 --> 02:45.094
I appreciate the gesture, but we simply
can't eat *this* breakfast. It's burnt.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.619
It's not that burnt.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.820
Never fear, my dear.
I'll get a proper breakfast going.

02:57.377 --> 02:58.271
Can I help?

02:58.272 --> 02:59.486
Oh! Uh...

02:59.487 --> 03:01.958
Of course. Uh, in one moment,
Sweetie Belle.

03:01.959 --> 03:03.744
Let me just get things started.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.420
Rarity!

03:14.421 --> 03:16.639
I thought you said I was gonna help.

03:16.785 --> 03:20.110
You are! You... can...

03:21.283 --> 03:22.946
...put the garnish on the plates.

03:23.747 --> 03:25.358
You mean this parsley?

03:27.325 --> 03:29.598
Okay now, easy! It has to be just right.

03:29.599 --> 03:30.575
No need to rush.

03:30.576 --> 03:32.438
No! That's too slow!

03:32.439 --> 03:33.837
Careful! Back up!

03:35.357 --> 03:37.091
Looking for perfection here.

03:45.253 --> 03:47.142
Not bad.

03:55.201 --> 03:57.075
There are some things I must attend to.

03:57.750 --> 04:00.105
Can you take the dirty towels
to the laundry room?

04:01.489 --> 04:04.065
No problem! I'll make myself useful.

04:15.209 --> 04:16.568
Sweetie Belle!

04:16.569 --> 04:19.881
I told you I'd make
myself useful. Surprised?

04:19.882 --> 04:20.882
Am I?

04:20.883 --> 04:25.366
You washed my incredibly expensive
one of a kind designer crochet wool sweater!

04:25.367 --> 04:28.069
Do you know how hard
these things are to come by?

04:28.070 --> 04:29.133
What's the big deal?

04:29.134 --> 04:33.157
The big deal is that
in the heat of the sun wool...

04:33.529 --> 04:34.795
...shrinks.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.341
Oh. Sorry.

04:39.772 --> 04:41.502
Well, back to work.

04:41.503 --> 04:42.862
I must create.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.441
Sorry?

04:45.442 --> 04:47.955
Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay?

04:48.267 --> 04:49.215
Please?

04:49.773 --> 04:52.875
I just want to do something
nice for my sister.

04:56.207 --> 04:59.284
RAAAGH! I'm so bored!

04:59.285 --> 05:01.946
When is Rarity gonna finish her work?

05:03.327 --> 05:05.455
"Stay out of trouble, okay?"

05:08.966 --> 05:10.953
I never got in trouble for drawing.

05:15.693 --> 05:19.019
Hmm. This needs something...

05:26.180 --> 05:27.073
Hi, Rarity!

05:27.074 --> 05:28.608
I made a special drawing for y...

05:28.609 --> 05:30.526
AAAAAH!

05:30.527 --> 05:33.135
Oh no! Did you use these gems?

05:33.136 --> 05:34.929
Well... Yes, but...

05:34.930 --> 05:37.059
I know you have more
in your work room...

05:37.060 --> 05:40.284
Bu... but these are extremely
rare baby blue sapphires!

05:40.285 --> 05:43.794
I need them for an outfit for
an extremely important client!

05:43.795 --> 05:45.715
Oh. Sorry.

05:47.094 --> 05:50.853
Sweetie Belle. What am I
going to do with you?!

05:50.854 --> 05:52.277
Oh! We could paint together.

05:52.278 --> 05:56.541
We could ride bikes, play chess,
sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fight...

05:56.542 --> 05:58.349
That not what I meant!

05:58.350 --> 05:59.054
Oh.

05:59.324 --> 06:01.571
Now I have to go and find
some more of these gems.

06:01.572 --> 06:02.542
I'll go with you and help...

06:02.543 --> 06:03.464
NO!

06:06.674 --> 06:07.980
No, thank you.

06:08.636 --> 06:11.556
You can help by picking up
these papers and stacking them.

06:11.557 --> 06:15.502
Neatly. Put the pens and pencils
exactly where you've found them.

06:15.503 --> 06:17.977
And please find something to do...

06:17.978 --> 06:21.171
...that doesn't create
a large mess for me to clean up!

06:22.761 --> 06:25.459
Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?

06:34.263 --> 06:35.745
Sweetie Belle!

06:36.449 --> 06:37.726
I'm back!

06:38.226 --> 06:39.649
Sweetie Belle!

06:42.859 --> 06:44.725
Surprise!

06:46.224 --> 06:47.337
You...

06:47.338 --> 06:49.582
My inspiration room!

06:50.614 --> 06:53.194
WHAT DID YOU DO?!
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

06:53.195 --> 06:57.330
When I saw the big mess in your room,
I thought I'd clean it up for you.

06:57.331 --> 07:01.068
This wasn't a mess!
It was organized chaos!

07:01.069 --> 07:03.830
I was just about finished
planning my new fashion line.

07:03.831 --> 07:06.244
And... and you... you...
you went and... and then you...

07:06.245 --> 07:08.564
...and you put everything away!

07:08.772 --> 07:11.519
But every time I make
a mess, you get upset.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.688
But this was MY mess.
In MY house!

07:15.349 --> 07:17.825
And now I'll have to
start from scratch!

07:17.826 --> 07:21.773
But... I... I thought it would...
make you happy.

07:22.064 --> 07:23.351
HAPPY?

07:23.750 --> 07:25.190
HAPPY?! I...

07:29.734 --> 07:31.483
I just need some time alone.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.412
How's the sleepover at Rarity's goin'?

07:47.064 --> 07:49.301
Why, it's smashing!

07:50.204 --> 07:50.921
Huh?

07:50.922 --> 07:53.580
I just wish we could do
something special together...

07:53.581 --> 07:55.758
...that didn't include me
goofing anything up.

07:56.194 --> 07:58.249
Oh! The Sisterhooves Social!

07:58.250 --> 08:00.223
Applejack and I do it every year!

08:00.224 --> 08:03.886
You and Rarity could compete against other
sister teams in all these neat events.

08:04.469 --> 08:06.893
That sounds like the perfect
way for us to hang out!

08:06.894 --> 08:09.312
Rarity will think it's an excellent idea.

08:09.313 --> 08:11.710
What a ridiculous idea!

08:11.711 --> 08:14.001
A contest at Sweet Apple Acres?

08:14.363 --> 08:15.621
It doesn't sound...

08:16.050 --> 08:17.876
...very clean.

08:18.675 --> 08:21.701
So what? Now you're back
to hating messes?

08:21.702 --> 08:24.242
Sweetie Belle! Watch your tone!

08:24.243 --> 08:26.219
I am still your big sister.

08:26.220 --> 08:30.371
Right! And any sister, who
cares about her sister, goes!

08:30.372 --> 08:33.452
Sweetie Belle! Honestly.

08:33.453 --> 08:37.466
Playing silly little games
in the dirt is just... uncouth.

08:37.467 --> 08:39.461
With or without a sister.

08:41.411 --> 08:43.564
Well then... maybe...

08:43.565 --> 08:46.921
...maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves
Social without a sister!

08:46.922 --> 08:51.514
In fact, I think I'll try the rest
of my life without a sister!

08:53.308 --> 08:56.973
Oh, I'm the one who's
ruining your life!? Really!?

08:56.974 --> 08:58.657
Have you looked around this place?

08:58.658 --> 09:02.088
I'm the one who would be
better off with no sister!

09:02.089 --> 09:05.187
Well, it looks like we
finally agree on something.

09:05.188 --> 09:07.393
Neither of us needs a sister.

09:07.394 --> 09:08.536
DEAL!

09:08.537 --> 09:11.197
DEAL! GOODBYE, UNSISTER!

09:19.793 --> 09:21.061
"Uncouth"?

09:21.685 --> 09:24.847
She said the Sisterhooves
Social was uncouth?

09:25.453 --> 09:27.024
Yeah! Uncouth?

09:29.114 --> 09:30.732
Wait. What's uncouth?

09:30.932 --> 09:34.746
It's not just the social.
She thinks I'm uncouth.

09:34.747 --> 09:37.952
Honey, Rarity thinks
everything's uncouth.

09:39.415 --> 09:40.779
What's uncouth?

09:40.780 --> 09:43.454
It means uncivil.
You know, bad mannered.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.582
Exactly!

09:46.133 --> 09:48.228
Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time.

09:48.229 --> 09:50.838
She'll come around. Sisters always do.

09:51.426 --> 09:53.793
Not sisters like Rarity.

09:54.172 --> 09:57.342
Come on now. Apple Bloom and I
got some chores to finish up on.

09:57.343 --> 09:58.758
Maybe you can help.

09:58.759 --> 10:02.869
You sure you want me to help?
I just mess everything up.

10:02.870 --> 10:06.005
Oh, come on. That's just
stinkin'-thinkin'. Watch.

10:13.068 --> 10:14.790
Good catch there, Apple Bloom.

10:20.771 --> 10:22.391
This is a chore?

10:22.392 --> 10:24.240
Since we can't sell
the bruised apples...

10:24.241 --> 10:26.437
...we gotta collect them all
for the pigs to eat.

10:28.823 --> 10:31.421
It's a lotta work.
So we make a game of it.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.530
Wanna try?

10:32.531 --> 10:34.141
Um... Okay.

10:35.526 --> 10:36.582
Ow!

10:37.579 --> 10:39.958
You're right. It is hard work.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.340
That's why we do it...

10:41.341 --> 10:42.884
...together!

10:43.985 --> 10:46.514
Rarity never wants to do chores together.

10:49.019 --> 10:50.962
All that work ruined.

10:51.207 --> 10:53.027
Thanks to Sweetie Belle.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.516
Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here.

11:00.408 --> 11:01.938
IDEA!

11:02.077 --> 11:04.282
This is genius.

11:05.279 --> 11:08.404
I shall call it:
"Full Spectrum Fashions".

11:08.810 --> 11:10.554
Why, if Sweetie Belle hadn't...

11:12.964 --> 11:14.490
Well. No matter.

11:14.491 --> 11:17.179
She still shouldn't have touched
my things without permission.

11:19.462 --> 11:21.142
Apple Bloom! You're up!

11:29.623 --> 11:32.711
You're making grape juice?

11:32.712 --> 11:34.924
Rarity would call
the fashion police on me...

11:34.925 --> 11:37.993
...if I got grape juice anywhere
*near* her precious outfits.

11:37.994 --> 11:39.789
Well, that's silly.

11:41.579 --> 11:42.740
Apple Bloom!

11:42.741 --> 11:44.393
Please, Applejack! She didn't mea...

11:44.839 --> 11:45.959
Whoa!

11:46.782 --> 11:49.263
How d'you like them grapes,
you little whippersnapper?

11:49.563 --> 11:50.642
That tickles...!

11:54.219 --> 11:57.710
Now to get these fabrics washed
for my fabulous new line.

11:58.060 --> 12:00.328
Oh! My favorite sweater.

12:00.329 --> 12:02.930
I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle...

12:08.727 --> 12:11.046
Oh, Opal, Opal.

12:11.047 --> 12:15.023
It's as if Sweetie Belle knew
the sweater was perfect for you.

12:15.622 --> 12:18.485
And Sweetie Belle should consider
herself perfectly lucky...

12:18.486 --> 12:21.197
...that this thoughtless
mishap turned out all right.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.721
Apple Bloom!

12:26.957 --> 12:28.345
Got it, sis!

12:32.302 --> 12:34.916
Wow. It's as if they're just one pony.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.546
YEEHAW!

12:36.547 --> 12:38.560
Way to corral some critters, sis.

12:38.561 --> 12:40.447
You could have just asked.

12:42.380 --> 12:45.011
Rarity never high-hooves me.

12:46.624 --> 12:47.469
Perfect.

12:47.470 --> 12:50.543
Just one more and this ensemble is fini.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.095
Sweetie Belle!

12:54.096 --> 12:57.047
Where's her silly little
arts and crafts project?

13:06.488 --> 13:09.720
Oh, Sweetie Belle!
My one and only sister.

13:09.721 --> 13:11.385
What have I done?!

13:12.393 --> 13:15.502
All the time I could have
spent with you was wasted...

13:15.503 --> 13:18.113
...complaining and wishing
you were gone!

13:18.313 --> 13:21.236
WOE IS ME!!!

13:21.237 --> 13:23.056
No! I must get her back.

13:23.057 --> 13:24.692
I must!

13:24.693 --> 13:30.008
As Celestia is my witness,
I shall never be sisterless again!

13:36.414 --> 13:37.411
Sweetie Belle!

13:38.256 --> 13:41.739
I have been galloping all over,
looking for you. I...

13:43.570 --> 13:46.880
Oh, hello, unsister.
What are you doing here?

13:46.881 --> 13:49.870
Better be careful. You might
get some dust on you.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.454
Oh, Sweetie Belle. I want to apologize.

13:54.455 --> 13:57.481
I am not better off without a sister.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.206
I'm not better off
without a sister either.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.525
Spending the day with Applejack and
Apple Bloom made me realize that.

14:03.526 --> 14:05.750
Oh! Oh, Sweetie.

14:05.751 --> 14:07.891
You don't know how happy
I am to hear you...

14:08.263 --> 14:11.976
And that's why I'm adopting
Applejack as my big sister!

14:11.977 --> 14:12.933
WHAT?!

14:13.695 --> 14:14.821
-What?
-What?

14:15.287 --> 14:18.332
A sister is someone who loves
and takes care of another sister.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.701
Applejack's a real sister.

14:22.982 --> 14:25.884
Hold on, Sweetie Belle.
Don't get ahead of yourself here.

14:25.885 --> 14:28.894
Besides, she's MY big sister.

14:29.691 --> 14:30.952
Yeah. Um...

14:30.953 --> 14:33.782
Or maybe she should be *your* sister...

14:33.783 --> 14:37.482
...so she could teach you what
a good sister is supposed to be.

14:38.864 --> 14:41.182
Um, actually I...

14:41.400 --> 14:45.131
Oh, I don't need lessons on being
a good sister. I... I promise!

14:45.132 --> 14:47.755
Listen. I'll show you how to
cook my favorite quiche.

14:47.756 --> 14:51.787
Or... or I'll show you the proper
way to beautify your mane.

14:52.187 --> 14:53.741
Won't that be fun?

14:55.379 --> 14:57.180
You want me to go home with you...

14:57.181 --> 15:01.261
...so *we* can do what *you* wanna do?

15:01.262 --> 15:03.578
Uh... Yes?

15:04.241 --> 15:05.805
Just forget it!

15:06.923 --> 15:08.785
We're still sisters, right?

15:10.721 --> 15:13.883
Well, that apology went swimmingly.

15:13.983 --> 15:18.806
Applejack, why do you have to be
so good and make me look so bad?

15:19.593 --> 15:20.844
Oh, Rarity.

15:20.845 --> 15:23.377
Once again you're
thinkin' about yourself.

15:23.378 --> 15:25.918
Bein' sisters is a give and take.

15:26.018 --> 15:27.971
You've been doin'
a whole lotta takin'...

15:27.972 --> 15:30.092
...but you haven't been
doin' a whole lotta givin'.

15:31.108 --> 15:32.727
But of course I give!

15:32.728 --> 15:35.923
I give lessons. Reasonable demands.

15:35.924 --> 15:38.413
But you never give in.

15:38.636 --> 15:41.404
Bein' sisters is like...

15:41.405 --> 15:42.639
...apple pie!

15:42.877 --> 15:47.612
You can have amazin' apples and you can
have a wonderfully crispy crust...

15:47.613 --> 15:51.726
...but only together can you
have a perfect apple pie.

15:52.816 --> 15:58.531
But apart all we are is just a pile
of mush and some crumbly dry mess.

15:59.651 --> 16:01.679
I know what I need to do!

16:01.680 --> 16:04.030
I just hope it isn't too late.

16:13.895 --> 16:17.052
Well, I guess it's a good
thing Rarity isn't here.

16:17.053 --> 16:20.669
Do I see "uncouth" written
all over this contest?

16:21.631 --> 16:23.745
Look at the size of that pig!

16:23.746 --> 16:25.706
He sure is a cutie.

16:25.707 --> 16:28.390
That's the last word Rarity would use.

16:28.391 --> 16:31.796
"Oh my! What a repulsive monstrosity!"

16:31.797 --> 16:34.479
"This thing needs
a head to toe makeover!"

16:35.496 --> 16:36.845
It's almost time!

16:37.442 --> 16:39.272
Well, you two have fun.

16:39.685 --> 16:42.551
I sure wish I had a sister
to run a race with.

16:43.638 --> 16:44.239
Huh?

16:44.240 --> 16:45.423
You do now!

16:45.424 --> 16:48.284
AB and I figured since
we do this every year...

16:48.285 --> 16:50.830
...I'd like you borrow my sis,
so you can give it a try.

16:50.831 --> 16:52.297
Sister for a day.

16:52.693 --> 16:53.801
No way!

16:53.802 --> 16:55.597
One. Day.

16:57.449 --> 16:59.449
One. Day.

17:00.563 --> 17:02.048
Is this thing on?

17:02.049 --> 17:04.482
I don't think this thing is on.

17:04.483 --> 17:05.933
Hello!

17:06.095 --> 17:07.970
What a...? Uh...

17:07.971 --> 17:09.436
You have to say so.

17:09.437 --> 17:11.918
Confangled modern doohickey!

17:12.652 --> 17:15.505
Now's the event you all
been waitin' for!

17:15.656 --> 17:18.648
The Sistersoci... The Socialhoof...

17:18.649 --> 17:22.205
Oh, dagnabit! You know, the big race!

17:22.206 --> 17:25.162
We have five teams
this year for the event!

17:25.163 --> 17:28.372
So all ya head on up
to the finish line, y'hear?

17:29.992 --> 17:33.132
THE START LINE! You coulda said.

17:33.133 --> 17:34.274
That's us.

17:34.672 --> 17:37.593
One. Day. Good luck!

17:37.957 --> 17:40.360
And may the best sisters win!

17:40.706 --> 17:42.152
On your mark...

17:43.128 --> 17:44.481
Get set...

17:46.461 --> 17:48.953
GOOO!

17:57.011 --> 17:58.463
You okay, Applejack?

18:09.460 --> 18:11.002
Applejack! Help!

18:36.046 --> 18:37.491
You can do it, sister!

19:24.572 --> 19:26.285
Oh, it was so close!

19:26.286 --> 19:27.952
You almost won!

19:27.953 --> 19:30.414
Thank you, Applejack. You were amazing.

19:30.415 --> 19:32.171
I don't even care that we didn't win.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.109
It was so much fun!

19:34.110 --> 19:34.969
Huh?

19:39.464 --> 19:40.681
Rarity?

19:44.424 --> 19:46.134
Wait. Where's Applejack?

19:47.711 --> 19:49.004
I don't get it.

19:50.907 --> 19:53.985
We switched places over
at the very first mudhole.

19:54.711 --> 19:58.323
So we did the whole
competition together?

19:58.324 --> 20:00.328
That we did, little sister.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.629
Well, except for the start line.

20:02.630 --> 20:04.801
But you finished together.

20:04.802 --> 20:07.906
You mean you were all in on it?

20:08.990 --> 20:10.993
You did this for me?

20:11.326 --> 20:14.034
Us. I did it for us.

20:16.045 --> 20:19.360
You see? We *are* apple pie.

20:19.847 --> 20:22.629
Uh... I'll explain later.

20:22.630 --> 20:25.729
For now, I think we
deserve a celebration.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.429
YEAH!

20:27.430 --> 20:28.506
Where?

20:28.507 --> 20:29.973
The spa, of course.

20:31.377 --> 20:32.806
Oh, Rarity.

20:33.684 --> 20:35.489
No, I... I'm serious.

20:38.827 --> 20:42.030
Very well then. What should we
write to the princess?

20:42.031 --> 20:42.917
I'll start.

20:42.918 --> 20:46.549
"Having a sister is just about
the bestest thing in the world."

20:46.550 --> 20:48.584
"But it sure isn't the easiest."

20:48.692 --> 20:51.621
"I agree, that being sisters
is a wonderful thing..."

20:51.622 --> 20:53.526
"...but it takes teamwork."

20:54.398 --> 20:56.300
"Sometimes it's about compromising."

20:58.601 --> 21:01.677
"Sometimes it's about accepting
each other's differences."

21:03.282 --> 21:06.368
"But mostly it's about
having fun together."

21:06.974 --> 21:10.359
"Even if it means getting your
hooves a little bit dirty."

21:10.360 --> 21:11.913
A lot dirty!

21:12.884 --> 21:14.527
A little bit dirty.

21:14.528 --> 21:15.769
A lot dirty!

21:15.770 --> 21:17.751
A little bit dirty!

21:17.752 --> 21:20.466
-A lo...
-Hold it, hold it.

21:20.467 --> 21:22.650
How about... "a medium
amount of dirty..."

21:22.651 --> 21:25.518
"...not too little, not
too much, just right."

21:25.966 --> 21:27.096
Deal!

21:32.964 --> 21:36.464
