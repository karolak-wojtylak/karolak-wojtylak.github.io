WEBVTT

00:03.515 --> 00:04.821
Hear ye,
hear ye!

00:05.040 --> 00:06.816
This meeting of the
Cutie Mark Crusaders

00:06.833 --> 00:08.328
is now in session.

00:08.480 --> 00:09.675
Who wants to do roll call?

00:11.368 --> 00:12.938
I'm pretty sure we're all here.

00:13.229 --> 00:15.440
Yeah, Apple Bloom,
what's this all about?

00:15.856 --> 00:17.633
Oh, nothin'...

00:19.157 --> 00:21.115
Except this letter
from Babs Seed

00:21.132 --> 00:22.909
saying she's got
her cutie mark!

00:22.993 --> 00:24.033
WHAT?

00:24.176 --> 00:26.176
She says it's a
pair of scissors.

00:26.534 --> 00:29.048
So... she's good
at cutting stuff?

00:29.115 --> 00:30.265
Of course!

00:30.517 --> 00:32.778
She was always fussing
with her bangs and tail.

00:33.082 --> 00:35.494
I'll bet she grows up to
be a celebrity stylist.

00:35.772 --> 00:38.273
But if she spends all
her time cutting hair,

00:38.703 --> 00:41.006
who's gonna run the
Manehattan CMCs?

00:41.292 --> 00:42.400
Well, not Babs.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.138
She can't be a
Cutie Mark Crusader

00:44.151 --> 00:45.915
if she's already got
her cutie mark.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.743
Oh, wow. I guess
you're right.

00:49.073 --> 00:52.160
I'm glad she's happy, but
I sure wouldn't want to be

00:52.193 --> 00:53.987
up to my flank in
mane hair all day.

00:54.105 --> 00:55.461
Can you imagine
getting stuck

00:55.486 --> 00:57.275
with a cutie mark
you didn't like?

00:58.437 --> 01:01.145
No... Or, at
least, I hadn't.

01:01.549 --> 01:02.694
Don't worry, Apple Bloom.

01:02.934 --> 01:05.317
Most of your family has
apple related cutie marks.

01:05.532 --> 01:06.656
I bet yours will be too.

01:06.909 --> 01:08.762
And what's not to
like about apples?

01:08.930 --> 01:12.395
There's the core, and sour
apples, and rotten apples,

01:12.412 --> 01:14.197
and apples with worms in them...

01:15.536 --> 01:16.248
What?

01:16.374 --> 01:17.305
Not helping.

01:27.321 --> 01:32.320

01:59.709 --> 02:01.267
I guess I just spent
so much time

02:01.284 --> 02:03.141
worrying about how to
get a cutie mark,

02:03.726 --> 02:06.185
I never even thought about
what would happen after.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.698
There's just so many
things I never considered.

02:09.915 --> 02:11.844
I'm sure there are, but
you don't need to--

02:11.890 --> 02:13.280
What if I finally
get my cutie mark

02:13.301 --> 02:14.286
and I don't like it?

02:14.581 --> 02:16.858
What if I get my cutie
mark and nopony likes me?

02:17.040 --> 02:18.273
Well, that's just ridicul--

02:18.298 --> 02:19.915
What if the Crusaders
drift apart?

02:20.176 --> 02:23.406
I mean, we won't really be the
Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore.

02:24.648 --> 02:25.882
What if it's not an apple?

02:25.983 --> 02:26.938
Will I have to move out?

02:27.250 --> 02:28.341
Where will I live?

02:28.412 --> 02:30.421
All right. That's
enough, sugar cube.

02:30.690 --> 02:33.861
Those are way too many questions
to answer all in one night.

02:34.029 --> 02:34.425
But--

02:34.496 --> 02:36.825
And nopony's gonna
make you move out.

02:37.077 --> 02:38.804
Are you sure, Applejack?

02:39.221 --> 02:40.581
Of course I'm sure.

02:40.930 --> 02:41.978
Now get some sleep.

02:42.404 --> 02:43.250
You'll see.

02:43.553 --> 02:45.351
Everything'll be
better in the morning.

02:46.088 --> 02:49.701
<i> ♪ Hush now little sister,</i>
<i>you're loved by all you know, ♪</i>

02:50.029 --> 02:51.789

02:51.861 --> 02:53.494

02:53.932 --> 02:58.080

03:07.701 --> 03:09.258
No matter what I get.

03:24.172 --> 03:25.385
Hoo whee!

03:25.503 --> 03:27.027
Nothing like a
good night's sleep.

03:27.296 --> 03:28.261
Breakfast!

03:31.317 --> 03:32.534
You were right, Applejack.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.193
I feel much better.

03:34.517 --> 03:36.783
I don't know what I was so
worried about last night.

03:37.174 --> 03:38.635
See? Now, what did
I tell you?

03:39.061 --> 03:40.938
A good night's sleep'll
fix just about an--

03:42.816 --> 03:45.174
Well, no wonder you
were so worked up.

03:45.482 --> 03:46.008
What?

03:47.040 --> 03:47.701
What is it?

03:48.058 --> 03:50.985
Looks like somepony
got her cutie mark!

03:52.673 --> 03:53.755
I can't believe it.

03:53.978 --> 03:55.658
I got my cutie mark.

03:57.894 --> 03:59.246
I got my cutie mark!

03:59.856 --> 04:02.378
I GOT MY CUTIE MARK!

04:06.016 --> 04:09.166
Wait till I tell the others
that my cutie mark is a, a...

04:10.741 --> 04:11.406
What is it?

04:11.861 --> 04:14.168
I have no idea
what it means.

04:14.543 --> 04:16.016
I know what it means.

04:21.658 --> 04:23.583
It means I can retire.

04:23.621 --> 04:24.951
Ha hoo!

04:27.760 --> 04:28.934
Infestations?

04:29.376 --> 04:31.115
You mean, like, Parasprites?

04:31.861 --> 04:35.642
Please. Any pony with a trombone
can get rid of Parasprites.

04:35.827 --> 04:38.029
I'm talking about
the serious stuff.

04:38.206 --> 04:41.040
You ever hear of Twittermites?

04:43.566 --> 04:44.690
Twittermites?

04:46.437 --> 04:49.309
Pest Ponies like you and me are
the only things keeping these

04:49.338 --> 04:52.341
live wires from destroying
half of Equestria.

04:52.867 --> 04:53.869
Pest Ponies?

04:54.105 --> 04:55.726
It's no easy trade.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.837
Even the best of us
yearns for the day

04:58.854 --> 05:01.473
they can move on to
greener pastures.

05:01.827 --> 05:06.033
And now that you're here to take
over, my day has finally come.

05:06.197 --> 05:07.258
Take over?

05:07.671 --> 05:09.743
You're gonna need to stop
repeating everything I say

05:09.764 --> 05:11.355
and pay attention if you
want to learn anything.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.061
I'm sorry.

05:13.385 --> 05:15.962
I guess this just wasn't
what I was expecting.

05:16.997 --> 05:19.385
Don't worry, with a
cutie mark like that,

05:19.448 --> 05:21.048
I'm sure you've got the touch.

05:21.309 --> 05:21.970
The touch?

05:22.282 --> 05:23.237
Oh. Sorry.

05:27.629 --> 05:30.046
Now you're gonna
need to be quick.

05:30.383 --> 05:34.505
Once these things get out,
it can get pretty shocking.

05:38.421 --> 05:38.972
Wait.

05:39.562 --> 05:40.328
What do you mean?

05:40.618 --> 05:41.267
OUCH!

05:41.583 --> 05:43.229
Ha ha! Told ya!

05:43.402 --> 05:44.960
And the farther
apart they spread,

05:44.993 --> 05:47.035
the more powerful
these jolts'll get.

05:50.410 --> 05:51.410
What do I do?

05:51.646 --> 05:53.048
Call them back,
of course.

05:54.416 --> 05:55.722
Twittermites!

05:57.246 --> 05:58.012
Here!

06:05.389 --> 06:06.648
Twittermites!

06:14.395 --> 06:16.480
Bug, bug, bug,
bug, bug, bug, bug!

06:20.753 --> 06:23.574
Well, it looks like
you're all set.

06:23.802 --> 06:25.191
Drop me a note sometime

06:25.216 --> 06:27.376
at the Piney Shade
retirement community.

06:27.747 --> 06:28.711
Now hold on...

06:28.976 --> 06:31.128
I'm sure this job
is real important,

06:31.195 --> 06:34.378
but I don't think I wanna call
bugs for the rest of my life.

06:35.860 --> 06:36.829
Hey, where'd he go?

06:37.435 --> 06:38.888
Well, well, well.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.591
Look at the new Bug Pony.

06:41.827 --> 06:43.305
It's Pest Pony.

06:44.206 --> 06:46.315
It sure is.

06:46.446 --> 06:47.128
Ew!

06:47.541 --> 06:51.730
I might have known you'd end up
with the worst cutie mark ever.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.071
But look on the bright side.

06:58.210 --> 07:02.395
Whenever you need a friend, you
can just go out and catch one.

07:02.677 --> 07:04.033
That's not funny.

07:04.206 --> 07:07.191
HEEEERE friend, friend,
friend, friend, friend...

07:07.229 --> 07:08.269
Stop it.

07:08.690 --> 07:10.711
Here, bug! Here, bug!

07:10.757 --> 07:12.286
Will you be my friend, bug?

07:12.345 --> 07:14.745
Because nopony else will!

07:14.825 --> 07:15.595
Ha ha ha!

07:15.629 --> 07:16.189
You know what?

07:16.328 --> 07:17.865
My cutie mark isn't the worst.

07:18.029 --> 07:19.052
You two are!

07:31.035 --> 07:33.326
I hate to think that
Diamond Tiara is right,

07:33.701 --> 07:36.812
but this cutie mark sure
isn't what I was hoping for.

07:37.326 --> 07:40.311
Why should you have
to keep it, then?

07:40.509 --> 07:41.435
Who's there?

07:42.113 --> 07:43.258
What do you mean?

07:46.391 --> 07:50.749
If your cutie mark bothers
you so much, get rid of it.

07:52.109 --> 07:53.755
Well, if you know
how to wave a hoof

07:53.772 --> 07:57.040
and erase a terrible cutie
mark, you go right ahead.

07:57.532 --> 08:00.235
As easily said as done.

08:05.710 --> 08:08.985
Huh. Now that is
some serious magic.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.646
Hey, where's everypony going?

08:22.206 --> 08:23.738
Mayor, what's going on!

08:24.008 --> 08:24.732
Apple Bloom!

08:24.846 --> 08:26.804
You've got to get your
family out of town!

08:31.595 --> 08:33.208
Twittermites!

08:41.835 --> 08:43.098
Twittermites!

08:44.863 --> 08:46.837
Heeeere, bug, bug,
bug, bug, bug!

08:50.749 --> 08:51.541
Here, bug!

09:00.084 --> 09:01.423
Come on here!

09:02.884 --> 09:05.696
Apple Bloom, what in
tarnation are you doing?

09:05.907 --> 09:08.749
I'm trying to stop the
infestation, of course!

09:09.145 --> 09:10.943
Only a Pest Pony can do that!

09:14.442 --> 09:15.317
Now come on.

09:15.465 --> 09:16.648
We've gotta skedaddle!

09:19.650 --> 09:21.343
But I've got to do something!

09:22.054 --> 09:23.473
Are you crazy?

09:41.082 --> 09:41.667
AAAAAHHH!

09:47.461 --> 09:48.547
Hoo whee!

09:48.884 --> 09:50.816
That's what I call
a nightmare!

09:51.216 --> 09:52.395
It seemed so real.

09:52.724 --> 09:54.395
Breakfast!

09:57.136 --> 10:00.437
Applejack, you are not gonna
believe the dream I just had.

10:00.715 --> 10:02.720
I guess I needed more
sleep than I thought.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.728
See? Now, what did
I tell you?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.762
A good night's sleep
will fix just abou--

10:08.290 --> 10:10.778
Well, no wonder you
were so worked up.

10:11.023 --> 10:11.650
What?

10:11.730 --> 10:14.631
Looks like somepony
got her cutie mark!

10:14.846 --> 10:15.814
Again?

10:16.155 --> 10:17.802
I mean, I did?

10:18.357 --> 10:19.709
Woohoo!

10:20.244 --> 10:21.360
Potion making!

10:21.747 --> 10:23.212
Now that's more like it!

10:23.452 --> 10:24.534
More like what?

10:25.178 --> 10:25.869
Never mind.

10:26.206 --> 10:28.273
I'm just glad Princess
Twilight's lessons

10:28.303 --> 10:29.410
finally paid off.

10:29.608 --> 10:31.734
I expect you want to run
off to the clubhouse

10:31.751 --> 10:33.823
and tell your friends all
about your new cutie mark.

10:34.181 --> 10:36.816
But before you go, make
sure you do all your--

10:39.389 --> 10:40.181
--chores?

10:43.900 --> 10:44.762
Woo hoo!

10:46.113 --> 10:47.200
Why all the excitement?

10:47.503 --> 10:48.909
Yeah. What's going on?

10:49.498 --> 10:51.435
Oh, nothin'.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.804
Except this brand
new cutie mark!

10:55.722 --> 10:57.094
Wow!
That's amazing!

10:57.115 --> 10:58.008
Whoo hoo!

11:00.130 --> 11:02.298
I don't suppose either
of you got yours?

11:02.631 --> 11:03.385
Nope.

11:03.646 --> 11:04.715
Me neither.

11:05.216 --> 11:06.231
I know it's silly but,

11:06.252 --> 11:08.938
I always hoped we'd get our
cutie marks together.

11:09.284 --> 11:10.269
Me too.

11:10.606 --> 11:12.606
But I'm still super
excited for you!

11:12.736 --> 11:14.058
Absolutely!

11:15.174 --> 11:15.970
I know!

11:16.480 --> 11:18.206
Let's call this
meeting to order.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.105
I'm sure the three
of us can figure out

11:20.122 --> 11:22.294
how to get two
more cutie marks!

11:22.880 --> 11:24.800
Um...yeah.

11:25.170 --> 11:26.644
The thing is...

11:26.972 --> 11:27.494
What?

11:27.886 --> 11:30.661
Well, you can't be a
Cutie Mark Crusader

11:30.715 --> 11:33.090
if you've already got
your cutie mark.

11:33.545 --> 11:35.002
Oh. Yeah.

11:35.229 --> 11:36.471
Just like Babs Seed.

11:37.048 --> 11:38.854
Well, I can just sit
quietly in the corner

11:38.871 --> 11:40.812
while you two figure out
what you're gonna do.

11:41.124 --> 11:44.703
Well, technically, the clubhouse
is for Crusaders only.

11:46.214 --> 11:46.715
Oh.

11:46.901 --> 11:47.469
Right.

11:48.282 --> 11:50.522
I guess I should just
come back later, then?

11:50.749 --> 11:51.254
Why?

11:51.557 --> 11:53.852
I mean, you can't
come in then either.

11:54.197 --> 11:54.694
Oh.

11:55.343 --> 11:56.261
Rules are rules.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.427
I don't even think we're
still supposed to be friends.

12:00.421 --> 12:00.905
What?

12:06.273 --> 12:07.730
Sweetie Belle?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.195
Scootaloo?

12:09.461 --> 12:11.578
Come on, fillies!
This isn't funny.

12:14.652 --> 12:17.343
More trouble with
cutie marks?

12:19.023 --> 12:19.709
No.

12:20.109 --> 12:21.663
I mean, yeah.

12:21.684 --> 12:22.576
I mean...

12:22.955 --> 12:26.058
Well, I got mine, but my
friends didn't get theirs

12:26.088 --> 12:27.818
and now there's all
kinds of trouble.

12:28.336 --> 12:31.098
<i> Sounds to me like cutie</i>
<i> marks and trouble</i>

12:31.111 --> 12:34.884
<i> are two peas in</i>
<i> the same pod.</i>

12:35.305 --> 12:36.362
I guess so.

12:36.787 --> 12:38.964
I mean, if I was a
blank flank again,

12:39.073 --> 12:40.522
there wouldn't be a problem.

12:41.018 --> 12:43.313
<i> Your wish is my command.</i>

12:51.911 --> 12:52.858
Hey, Apple Bloom.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.042
Why'd you want to meet here?

12:55.713 --> 12:58.576
Well, us blankflanks
have to meet somewhere!

12:59.541 --> 13:01.397
Um... actually,
Apple Bloom,

13:01.705 --> 13:03.768
we both sort of got
our cutie marks.

13:04.564 --> 13:05.637
You did?

13:06.951 --> 13:07.882
What are they?

13:08.345 --> 13:11.103
Oh, we don't have time
to go into all that.

13:11.818 --> 13:14.753
And we certainly don't have time
to hang out in an old clubhouse.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.107
Yeah. We've got
responsibilities now.

13:17.431 --> 13:19.023
But, maybe we'll see you later.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.370
Much later.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.098
Wait!

13:21.326 --> 13:22.033
Hold on!

13:22.256 --> 13:23.507
I can get my cutie mark back.

13:23.789 --> 13:24.593
I think.

13:25.427 --> 13:27.242
I mean, I got it once, right?

13:28.025 --> 13:29.528
Just wait a second!

13:31.381 --> 13:34.000
No!

13:42.884 --> 13:45.658
What in Equestria is going on?

13:45.869 --> 13:47.482
Breakfast!

13:47.810 --> 13:51.587
I'm not so sure sleep is the
cure-all Applejack thinks it is.

13:53.764 --> 13:55.410
Uh... Applejack?

13:55.734 --> 13:58.593
I know you said sleep is
supposed to make me feel better,

13:58.635 --> 14:01.667
but I'm pretty sure it's
making me feel worse.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.688
See? Now, what did
I tell you?

14:03.970 --> 14:05.275
A good night's
sleep will fix--

14:06.370 --> 14:08.981
Well, no wonder you
were so worked up.

14:10.345 --> 14:11.886
Didn't you hear what I said?

14:12.029 --> 14:12.871
I was trying to--

14:12.896 --> 14:16.707
Well, what do
we have here?

14:16.955 --> 14:17.873
What is it, Granny?

14:18.109 --> 14:18.783
What's wrong?

14:19.225 --> 14:20.694
Oh, nothin'.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.202
Right, Applejack?

14:22.736 --> 14:23.658
Right.

14:23.865 --> 14:25.258
Nothin' at all.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.635
Right, Big Mac?

14:28.943 --> 14:30.446
Truth is, Apple Bloom...

14:30.720 --> 14:32.690
it's your cutie mark.

14:33.006 --> 14:33.865
Eeyup.

14:34.429 --> 14:35.313
Oh, no.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.641
What is it now?

14:42.012 --> 14:43.650
Well, I'll tell
you what it ain't.

14:44.126 --> 14:45.987
It ain't no apple!

14:46.480 --> 14:47.334
Nnope!

14:47.671 --> 14:48.168
What?

14:48.589 --> 14:52.800
And we don't have
room for non-Apples!

14:52.964 --> 14:53.848
Nnope!

14:54.181 --> 14:55.962
Time for you
to mosey on.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.789
You can't stay here.

14:58.134 --> 14:59.726
But this is my home.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.229
Oh, and you're gonna
have to change your name.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.402
Eeyup!

15:08.151 --> 15:11.107
I think just "Bloom"
has a nice ring to it,

15:11.473 --> 15:13.343
don't you, Applejack?

15:13.414 --> 15:14.391
Eeyup!

15:18.623 --> 15:22.732
Nooooooo!

15:31.381 --> 15:31.991
All right.

15:32.311 --> 15:34.698
This is getting ridiculous.

15:43.389 --> 15:44.261
Hoo whee!

15:44.442 --> 15:47.414
I never thought I'd be so
happy to not get a cutie mark.

15:47.911 --> 15:48.753
What the--?

15:58.126 --> 15:59.132
ARGH!

15:59.351 --> 16:02.450
I don't want to see another
cutie mark as long as I live!

16:07.726 --> 16:09.941
<i> Back so soon?</i>

16:10.429 --> 16:13.675
All right, whoever you are, I
don't know what spell you went

16:13.751 --> 16:17.077
and cast on me but I want
it to stop right now!

16:17.600 --> 16:19.427
<i> I didn't cast a spell.</i>

16:19.444 --> 16:21.873
<i> On you or anypony else.</i>

16:22.332 --> 16:24.821
<i> I only did what you wanted.</i>

16:24.905 --> 16:26.378
Agh!

16:26.854 --> 16:29.957
Why would I want you to
torment me with nightmares?

16:30.252 --> 16:33.309
<i> You didn't want to</i>
<i> catch bugs and I helped.</i>

16:33.629 --> 16:36.505
<i> You didn't want to lose</i>
<i> friends and I helped.</i>

16:36.846 --> 16:39.528
<i> If there's a problem</i>
<i> with your family,</i>

16:39.658 --> 16:42.214
<i> I'm sure I can</i>
<i> help with that too.</i>

16:42.501 --> 16:44.189
I don't want your help.

16:44.555 --> 16:46.307
Just get away from me!

16:47.435 --> 16:51.082
Oh, Apple Bloom, you can't get
away from your own shadow.

17:00.412 --> 17:01.423
Princess Luna!

17:01.701 --> 17:02.513
My shadow?

17:02.770 --> 17:03.566
What do you mean?

17:12.230 --> 17:13.237
It's just me?

17:13.660 --> 17:16.269
You mean I've been doing
all this to myself?

17:16.560 --> 17:17.760
<i> Of course, Apple Bloom.</i>

17:18.298 --> 17:19.322
<i> It's your dream.</i>

17:20.357 --> 17:23.288
If I've been dreaming this whole
time, why don't I just wake up?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.050
<i> Sometimes we can worry</i>
<i> about a thing so much,</i>

17:26.071 --> 17:29.145
<i> the fear can make us feel like</i>
<i> we're trapped in a nightmare.</i>

17:34.669 --> 17:36.404
I don't suppose
there's anything

17:36.421 --> 17:38.715
you're particularly
afraid of, is there?

17:39.267 --> 17:40.383
Yeah.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.898
I guess I'm pretty worried
about getting my cutie mark.

17:44.190 --> 17:47.490
Well, that is the same as
worrying about who you are.

17:48.029 --> 17:49.692
That is all a cutie mark is.

17:50.054 --> 17:51.953
If you cannot
accept who you are,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.488
your life might seem
like a bad dream.

17:55.498 --> 17:59.915
But, if I like who I am, do you
think other ponies will too?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.492
Of course.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.715
Then it doesn't matter
what my cutie mark is!

18:07.317 --> 18:08.404
Indeed.

18:08.703 --> 18:10.320
But that's so simple.

18:10.543 --> 18:12.829
I must be the only
pony in the universe

18:12.846 --> 18:14.635
this worried about
her cutie mark.

18:15.035 --> 18:17.448
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

19:04.442 --> 19:09.461
Aaaaahh!

19:16.450 --> 19:19.309
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle
are having nightmares too?

19:19.663 --> 19:21.431
It's been a busy
night for us all,

19:21.941 --> 19:24.433
but I think it's time
to bring it to a close.

19:30.543 --> 19:32.075
Princess Luna!

19:32.560 --> 19:34.720
I know you've all had a
lot on your minds tonight,

19:35.237 --> 19:38.054
but I think Apple Bloom has
something she'd like to share

19:38.075 --> 19:39.052
before you wake.

19:39.877 --> 19:40.930
We're still asleep?

19:41.861 --> 19:42.997
Cool!

19:46.795 --> 19:49.583
Well, I guess I should
call this dream meeting

19:49.608 --> 19:51.713
of the Cutie Mark
Crusaders to order.

19:53.183 --> 19:55.621
I know we all got pretty
anxious when we found out

19:55.667 --> 19:57.157
Babs got her cutie mark.

19:57.372 --> 20:00.096
But I, for one, don't wanna
have nightmares every night

20:00.117 --> 20:01.709
from now until we get ours.

20:01.928 --> 20:02.778
Me neither.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.969
And even though we're
all a little scared,

20:05.023 --> 20:06.972
a cutie mark won't
change who we are

20:06.997 --> 20:08.833
or how everypony
feels about us.

20:09.111 --> 20:11.528
It's lucky we're all
scared of the same things.

20:11.726 --> 20:13.532
That way we can help
and remind each other

20:13.557 --> 20:14.854
to just be who we are.

20:15.418 --> 20:16.387
And when the day comes

20:16.404 --> 20:18.581
that you all finally
get your cutie marks,

20:18.833 --> 20:20.938
you can be sure they'll
fit you to a tee.

20:21.343 --> 20:22.534
Exactly.

20:23.027 --> 20:25.343
Do you fillies think that
Babs is worried or scared

20:25.368 --> 20:26.437
about some of this stuff?

20:27.385 --> 20:28.063
I know!

20:28.286 --> 20:30.669
Let's put together a
care package for her!

20:30.938 --> 20:32.833
That way she'll know
she isn't alone!

20:33.288 --> 20:34.332
We wouldn't want
her to think

20:34.357 --> 20:36.189
that just because she
isn't a Crusader,

20:36.412 --> 20:38.004
we can't still be friends.

20:39.183 --> 20:40.210
But...

20:40.804 --> 20:42.888
maybe we should wait
until we wake up.

20:43.162 --> 20:43.978
Good idea.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.667
<i>♪ There ain't no call to worry,</i>
<i> so don't you cry or fret... ♪</i>

21:06.362 --> 21:10.265
<i> ♪ A cutie mark won't change</i>
<i> me, no matter what I get! ♪</i>

21:10.741 --> 21:13.330
Well, it sure looks like
somepony is feeling better.

21:14.715 --> 21:16.842
You have no idea.

21:17.267 --> 21:19.313
See? Now, what did
I tell ya?

21:19.751 --> 21:22.467
A good night's sleep cures
just about everything.

21:23.536 --> 21:24.741
I guess so...

21:25.149 --> 21:28.193
I just wish it hadn't
been so exhausting.
