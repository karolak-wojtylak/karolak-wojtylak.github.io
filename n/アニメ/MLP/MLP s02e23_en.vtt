00:09.095 --> 00:12.444
Can you believe Featherweight
got his cutie mark?

00:12.595 --> 00:14.725
Featherweight! Before us!

00:18.768 --> 00:21.160
Great cutie mark, Featherweight!

00:21.695 --> 00:23.488
Looking good!

00:24.844 --> 00:26.055
I give up...

00:26.206 --> 00:27.306
I've got it!

00:28.082 --> 00:31.125
The answer to all our problems!

00:31.276 --> 00:33.131
The Foal Free Press?

00:33.282 --> 00:35.931
How's the school paper
gonna get us our cutie marks?

00:36.460 --> 00:37.961
Move your caboose!

00:38.212 --> 00:40.509
That's Granny Smith. Gotta run!

00:40.660 --> 00:43.765
Maybe there's something
to this newspaper idea.

00:43.916 --> 00:45.574
Guess it's worth a shot...

01:09.116 --> 01:13.700
Apple Bloom, your newspaper idea
was nothing but a big bust.

01:22.045 --> 01:23.345
What's so funny?

01:23.496 --> 01:26.665
What I meant was,
we should write for the paper!

01:26.816 --> 01:29.795
We can get our cutie marks as journalists!

01:34.435 --> 01:39.435

02:08.867 --> 02:10.874
Okay class, see you tomorrow!

02:11.025 --> 02:13.562
Oh, and for those of you who want
to join the newspaper staff,

02:13.713 --> 02:16.245
stay here because we're meeting right now!

02:16.396 --> 02:18.215
Cutie marks in journalism!

02:18.366 --> 02:19.970
Such a good idea.

02:20.121 --> 02:21.321
Welcome, everypony.

02:21.472 --> 02:25.156
Now, as you know,
our editor-in-chief graduated last year.

02:27.295 --> 02:28.253
Yes?

02:28.404 --> 02:29.745
What's an editor-in-chief?

02:29.896 --> 02:34.045
Good question, Sweetie Belle,
I like those reporters' instincts.

02:35.282 --> 02:38.077
The Foal Free Press
is a student-run paper.

02:38.228 --> 02:40.095
I'm only involved as an advisor.

02:40.246 --> 02:43.295
So the editor-in-chief
is the pony in charge.

02:43.296 --> 02:46.905
From choosing the stories,
to making sure it gets to press on time.

02:47.056 --> 02:51.855
Now, as I said,
we have a new editor this year!

02:54.158 --> 02:55.845
Diamond Tiara?!

02:57.294 --> 03:00.395
I'll leave you alone now to discuss
everypony's assignments.

03:00.546 --> 03:01.646
Have fun!

03:03.322 --> 03:04.995
Alright, listen up.

03:05.846 --> 03:07.945
The Foal Free Press is a joke.

03:08.881 --> 03:11.474
Nopony at this school takes it seriously.

03:11.625 --> 03:16.595
Well I, the editor-in-chief in charge,
am gonna deliver us to newfound glory!

03:18.068 --> 03:19.312
Yay!

03:19.463 --> 03:21.755
First things first,
where's the staff photographer?

03:22.695 --> 03:25.103
Get out there and document everything.

03:25.254 --> 03:27.145
I'll decide what's important.

03:27.296 --> 03:30.962
The rest of you, I want hard-hitting news
and interesting thinkpieces.

03:31.113 --> 03:34.026
No more namby-pamby stories
like last year's editor.

03:34.177 --> 03:36.609
But Namby-Pamby was a great editor.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.500
Well, there's a new regime now,
and I want juicy stories.

03:39.651 --> 03:40.851
The juicier the better!

03:41.002 --> 03:42.806
Now get out there and report!

03:45.772 --> 03:47.069
Let's get out of here, girls.

03:47.220 --> 03:49.312
Maybe we can try packing boxes again.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.747
But this could be our last chance
to earn our cutie marks!

03:52.898 --> 03:55.355
If we really are supposed
to be journalists,

03:55.506 --> 03:57.342
isn't it worth a little grief?

03:57.493 --> 03:58.693
I guess you're right.

03:58.844 --> 04:02.203
We can take a little bit of Diamond Tiara
for a lifetime of cutie marks.

04:02.354 --> 04:05.009
C'mon! Let's go get those marks!

04:05.475 --> 04:08.794
<i>My first story's gonna be
an exclusive interview.</i>

04:23.485 --> 04:26.455
<i>I saw a brand new nest
of baby birds the other day.</i>

04:26.606 --> 04:29.753
<i>I bet our readers would eat up
a sweet story like that!</i>

04:37.906 --> 04:40.295
<i>Granny Smith has all sorts
of great stories!</i>

04:40.446 --> 04:43.341
<i>I reckon I'll do a piece
on the history of Ponyville.</i>

04:58.752 --> 05:02.511
I hope you've got something,
because everything so far is unusable.

05:03.602 --> 05:06.959
"Baby Birds Born...?"
"Rarity's Hot New Hat...?"

05:07.110 --> 05:09.832
"Ponyville, The Early Years...!?"

05:11.972 --> 05:15.204
I don't know what you call this,
but it sure isn't news!

05:15.505 --> 05:16.812
We just... thought...

05:17.113 --> 05:19.646
Get something else on my desk
by the end of the day,

05:19.797 --> 05:22.068
and it better be juicy!

05:27.072 --> 05:31.121
Now what? Do you know what
I had to do to get that story?

05:31.272 --> 05:34.951
Oh, you don't even wanna know
what I had to sit through.

05:36.646 --> 05:38.482
Get it off me, Snails!

05:38.633 --> 05:41.897
Yeah, you get it off me, Snips?

05:42.645 --> 05:45.167
Stop it! You are making it worse!

05:47.895 --> 05:48.995
Oh, great.

05:49.146 --> 05:50.294
I'll get it.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.541
Get it off! Get it off!

05:56.645 --> 05:58.728
Hey, Featherweight, c'mere!

06:00.135 --> 06:03.206
Take a few pictures of this,
then meet me during lunch.

06:04.595 --> 06:07.502
Girls, I have our story.

06:08.135 --> 06:11.295
<i>Snips and Snails in bubblegum fails!</i>

06:11.446 --> 06:15.676
"And that's when the biggest jokester
in school really stuck his hoof in it..."

06:15.827 --> 06:16.995
"... literally!"

06:17.146 --> 06:20.682
The Foal Free Press is usually
just boring news and stuff.

06:20.833 --> 06:22.446
So funny!

06:22.597 --> 06:25.675
Our mothers always told us
we'd end up in the papers someday.

06:25.826 --> 06:27.002
Yeah, and look!

06:27.153 --> 06:29.696
We finally got the gum out!

06:31.107 --> 06:33.395
Your column is a sensation!

06:33.546 --> 06:34.996
I don't want you doing news anymore.

06:35.147 --> 06:37.425
I want more columns like this.

06:38.693 --> 06:41.109
Columns about ponies
and their private lives...

06:41.260 --> 06:43.390
The things they do when
they think they're alone...

06:43.895 --> 06:47.017
You three are my new gossip columnists!

06:47.918 --> 06:50.594
And I love the way you signed it!

06:50.745 --> 06:54.495
Gabby Gums...
that was a stroke of genius!

06:54.646 --> 06:56.095
We couldn't fit all of our names.

06:56.246 --> 06:59.265
So we decided to create one
for all three of us.

06:59.666 --> 07:02.345
Well, I want more Gabby Gums!

07:02.496 --> 07:03.596
Nice work, girls.

07:04.197 --> 07:06.674
But we sure seem
to have a gift for gossip.

07:06.825 --> 07:10.068
If we can write a few more
of these Gabby Gums columns,

07:10.219 --> 07:12.500
we'll earn our cutie marks for sure!

07:16.595 --> 07:19.995
Scootaloo...? Do you have anything?

07:20.146 --> 07:21.146
Nope.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.486
Apple Bloom?

07:24.681 --> 07:26.194
Sorry.

07:26.345 --> 07:30.545
Let's face it, nothing very juicy
happens at this school.

07:33.310 --> 07:34.745
We're doomed.

07:46.713 --> 07:50.277
Sweetie Belle... was she raised
in a barn or something?

07:54.158 --> 07:56.735
You really shouldn't be snooping, Rarity.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.652
Oh, but it's so much fun, Rarity.

08:01.803 --> 08:04.434
Hello... what's this?

08:06.222 --> 08:07.800
Gum on their bum!

08:08.552 --> 08:09.764
Too rich!

08:10.015 --> 08:12.958
Can you please keep it down
with all the laughter?

08:13.109 --> 08:15.101
I'm trying to- hey!

08:16.162 --> 08:17.452
I was just...

08:17.603 --> 08:19.702
Are you snooping through my saddlebag?

08:25.652 --> 08:27.232
How dare you!

08:27.383 --> 08:30.602
Oh, but this Gabby Gums
column is so funny!

08:31.252 --> 08:33.716
You actually like the school paper?

08:33.867 --> 08:38.714
It's so much juicier than anything
in the boring old Ponyville Express.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.628
Could I borrow this to show my friends?

08:41.779 --> 08:45.152
Your friends would wanna read
the Foal Free Press?

08:45.303 --> 08:47.842
Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums!

08:47.993 --> 08:49.193
Who is she, anyway?

08:49.344 --> 08:51.720
I've never heard of her before.
Is she a new-

08:55.385 --> 08:57.601
We gave up too quickly, girls.

08:57.752 --> 08:59.910
Forget trying to squeeze stories
out of this school.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.062
We need to expand!

09:02.213 --> 09:05.558
We can find all kinds of great gossip
out there in Ponyville!

09:05.709 --> 09:08.566
We'll need to tell Featherweight
to start working overtime.

09:09.017 --> 09:11.361
Sweetie Belle, you're a genius!

09:17.150 --> 09:20.506
<i>"Pound and Pumpkin Cake trip
to the store ends in tears."</i>

09:20.757 --> 09:23.251
Gabby Gums comes through again!

09:24.000 --> 09:27.205
The Ponyville news stand
wants to carry the Foal Free Press!

09:27.356 --> 09:29.369
Ponies keep coming by and asking for it!

09:29.520 --> 09:31.649
Send 'em twenty copies,
and if they run out of those,

09:31.800 --> 09:33.750
we'll send 'em twenty more!

09:34.351 --> 09:37.030
You three are doing
a great job for this paper.

09:37.181 --> 09:39.626
Keep those columns coming!

09:39.777 --> 09:41.400
This is great!

10:06.451 --> 10:09.400
Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls?

10:09.551 --> 10:11.982
The best hooficure I've ever had!

10:12.950 --> 10:15.505
You said it.

10:17.100 --> 10:20.223
I don't know if I've ever been
so relaxed.

10:20.374 --> 10:21.374
You guys!

10:22.775 --> 10:24.369
The new Gabby Gums just came out!

10:24.520 --> 10:27.900
<i>"The Great and Powerful Trixie's
secrets revealed!"</i>

10:28.051 --> 10:30.630
We already read that one, Rainbow Dash.

10:30.781 --> 10:34.870
Come on, relax, have a hooficure,
it feels amazing.

10:35.021 --> 10:36.958
Did you forget who you're talking to?

10:37.109 --> 10:40.465
The day I get a hooficure
is the day I turn in my daredevil license.

10:40.616 --> 10:43.205
Besides, I haven't read
this Gabby Gums yet.

10:43.906 --> 10:46.243
Well, do it quietly, will ya?

10:47.700 --> 10:49.750
Some of us are trying to unwind!

10:49.901 --> 10:53.950
I like Gabby Gums too, but don't
you think she can be a little mean?

10:54.150 --> 10:57.100
She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot!

10:57.251 --> 10:59.200
<i>"Celestia, just like us?"</i>

10:59.351 --> 11:02.481
Gabby Gums doesn't value
anypony's privacy.

11:02.632 --> 11:06.633
Oh, lighten up, Twilight,
there's nothing but harmless gossip!

11:07.084 --> 11:09.201
Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.001
<i>"Mayor, not naturally gray!"</i>

11:12.152 --> 11:14.520
"The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal?"

11:14.671 --> 11:16.475
Who wouldn't wanna read that?

11:16.626 --> 11:19.900
I just can't help feeling sorry for
the ponies featured in her columns.

11:20.051 --> 11:22.317
It's gotta be a little embarrassing.

11:22.468 --> 11:23.468
Are you kidding?

11:23.619 --> 11:26.049
Do you know how awesome it is
to get your name in the paper?

11:26.200 --> 11:29.690
Rainbow, why don't you join me
in one of these delicious hooficures?

11:31.600 --> 11:36.923
It's that good, huh?
Well, maybe just one little hoof.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.690
Forget it, I don't like ponies
touching my hooves.

11:53.625 --> 11:57.200
Man... I'd love it if Gabby Gums
did a story on me.

11:57.351 --> 11:58.651
She did one on me.

11:58.802 --> 11:59.802
What?!

12:00.505 --> 12:03.926
<i>"Exclusive! Local dragon tells all."</i>

12:04.077 --> 12:08.900
"Spike opens up about Canterlot,
naps, and his favorite jams!"

12:09.051 --> 12:10.760
It's our best column yet!

12:11.011 --> 12:13.850
More like your worst column yet!

12:14.001 --> 12:16.250
Gabby Gums didn't become
the biggest thing in Ponyville

12:16.401 --> 12:18.688
with namby-pamby stories like this!

12:21.950 --> 12:23.525
Yeah, she's right.

12:23.676 --> 12:27.443
This column is a little softer
than our usual gossip.

12:27.650 --> 12:30.880
Were you guys feeling guilty
about all the gossip too?

12:31.031 --> 12:34.314
Like... maybe we could be
hurting other ponies' feelings?

12:34.465 --> 12:39.685
Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything because
everypony loves Gabby Gums so much,

12:39.836 --> 12:44.011
but... I was sorta hoping we could start
writing more stories like this one.

12:44.162 --> 12:45.462
Me too.

12:47.491 --> 12:50.902
If we're gonna get our cutie marks,
we've got to give the ponies

12:51.053 --> 12:52.053
what they want.

12:55.330 --> 12:57.751
<i>"Applejack, asleep on the job!"</i>

12:57.902 --> 12:59.610
Can y'all believe this?!

12:59.761 --> 13:00.485
And this one:

13:00.636 --> 13:03.322
<i>"Big Macintosh, what's he hiding?"</i>

13:03.462 --> 13:06.081
Who the hay does this Gabby Gums
think she is?

13:06.232 --> 13:07.332
Listen to this one.

13:07.483 --> 13:10.850
<i>"Twilight Sparkle, I was a Canterlot snob."</i>

13:11.001 --> 13:14.253
"A well-placed scaly source
close to the prissy pony says..."

13:14.404 --> 13:17.724
"Twilight Sparkle thinks Ponyville
is nothing but muddy roads..."

13:17.875 --> 13:19.401
"... and low-class rooves."

13:19.652 --> 13:20.752
Spike!

13:21.800 --> 13:23.862
How could you say such a thing?

13:24.213 --> 13:27.248
Well, I didn't! Gabby Gums made that up!

13:27.399 --> 13:28.599
I never said anything like that!

13:28.750 --> 13:30.838
Everypony, please!

13:30.989 --> 13:34.676
She's just a harmless schoolpony
engaged in a little idle gossip.

13:34.827 --> 13:37.483
You're really making too big a deal
out of this.

13:37.634 --> 13:39.395
But it's all lies!

13:39.546 --> 13:41.499
Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants.

13:41.650 --> 13:44.031
She doesn't care whose reputation
she destroys!

13:44.070 --> 13:46.470
<i>"Fluttershy has tail extensions!"</i>

13:49.599 --> 13:52.376
<i>"Pinkie Pie is an out-of-control
party animal!"</i>

13:52.527 --> 13:53.527
What?!

13:54.228 --> 13:58.455
It's true! I do have a problem!

13:58.856 --> 14:02.750
Oh look! According to this one,
the Cakes are breaking up!

14:03.450 --> 14:04.501
We are?!

14:04.802 --> 14:08.578
Well, my life is officially... over.

14:08.729 --> 14:11.200
Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale.

14:11.201 --> 14:14.990
<i>"Rainbow Dash,
Speed demon or super softie?"</i>

14:15.141 --> 14:18.365
I grabbed as many copies as I could,
but it was too late!

14:18.516 --> 14:21.079
I'm a laughing stock!

14:21.400 --> 14:22.524
See, Rarity?

14:22.675 --> 14:26.009
Your so-called 'harmless gossip'
can be very hurtful!

14:26.160 --> 14:29.360
Honestly, you ponies
have no sense of humor.

14:29.511 --> 14:32.629
So she tweaks a few ponies
every now and then,

14:32.780 --> 14:33.780
maybe they deserv-

14:35.157 --> 14:37.200
I'll destroy her!

14:37.351 --> 14:38.741
<i>"The drama queen diaries."</i>

14:38.892 --> 14:40.492
She's reprinted my diary!

14:40.643 --> 14:44.160
How could Gabby Gums possibly
get access to my private diary?!

14:44.311 --> 14:46.937
We've got to put a stop to this
once and for all!

14:47.088 --> 14:49.240
Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff.

14:49.391 --> 14:51.676
Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is!

14:53.143 --> 14:57.660
My sister would never associate
with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums!

14:57.811 --> 15:00.367
I resent you even suggesting
such a thing, Twilight!

15:00.518 --> 15:04.860
Why, she's the most innocent,
most lovely...

15:05.211 --> 15:08.218
... most evil pony in Equestria!

15:08.569 --> 15:11.678
My own sister steals my private diary.

15:11.829 --> 15:16.608
How could my own sister be...
Gabby Gums?

15:24.150 --> 15:27.067
<i>Et tu, Gabby Gums?! </i>

15:27.218 --> 15:28.936
You know?! How'd you find out?!

15:29.087 --> 15:31.770
The gilded pages of your betrayal!

15:32.000 --> 15:33.121
Oh yeah.

15:33.342 --> 15:35.262
How could you do this to me?!

15:35.413 --> 15:40.088
You stole my secret diary and published it
for all the world to read!

15:40.239 --> 15:42.299
Gossip can be a very hurtful thing.

15:42.450 --> 15:46.207
It is an invasion of privacy, just like
when I snooped through your saddlebag.

15:46.358 --> 15:48.253
You didn't like that much, did you?

15:48.444 --> 15:49.404
No...

15:49.555 --> 15:53.079
What is important is that you understand
how your column makes the ponies

15:53.230 --> 15:54.847
that you're writing about feel!

15:54.998 --> 15:58.030
I do understand,
and we've all been feeling guilty.

15:58.181 --> 16:00.784
But we just want our cutie marks so badly!

16:00.935 --> 16:03.663
Do you really think that
writing nasty things

16:03.814 --> 16:07.030
and making everypony feel horrible
is your destiny?

16:07.181 --> 16:09.704
Well, when you put it that way...

16:09.855 --> 16:10.855
No!

16:11.006 --> 16:12.979
I won't let you quit!

16:13.130 --> 16:16.854
But the gossip we've been printing
is hurting everypony's feelings!

16:17.005 --> 16:20.185
Feelings? I don't care about feelings!

16:20.336 --> 16:22.590
Gabby Gums is my bread and butter.

16:22.741 --> 16:24.700
And I'm not gonna let you
goody two horseshoes

16:24.851 --> 16:26.151
take that away from me!

16:26.360 --> 16:29.666
We're sorry, Diamond Tiara,
but we've made our decision.

16:29.817 --> 16:32.887
Yeah, you can't force us
to keep gossiping.

16:33.638 --> 16:35.578
When you see these...

16:35.729 --> 16:38.615
You may not want to quit after all.

16:43.154 --> 16:46.705
I told Featherweight
to document everything...

16:51.100 --> 16:53.398
And that's exactly what he did.

16:54.760 --> 16:55.983
Gimme those!

16:56.134 --> 16:59.039
Sorry, girls, property of
the Foal Free Press.

16:59.550 --> 17:02.691
And if Gabby Gums really
does go into retirement,

17:02.842 --> 17:06.112
I'll need something to fill
that empty column space.

17:07.140 --> 17:10.900
Now get out there
and bring me more Gabby Gums!

17:13.350 --> 17:15.280
We'll find a way out of this, girls.

17:15.431 --> 17:17.636
Maybe Rainbow Dash
will have a story for us.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.287
She's always good for some gossip.

17:19.560 --> 17:23.046
Rainbow Dash! Hey, Rainbow Dash!

17:23.197 --> 17:26.466
Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums.

17:26.617 --> 17:28.017
You heard too, huh?

17:28.168 --> 17:29.158
Are you kidding?

17:29.309 --> 17:31.776
Everypony in town knows it's you three.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.941
Don't suppose you'd let us
write a column on you, huh?

17:46.100 --> 17:48.630
Oh, hi Angel, is Fluttershy home?

17:58.287 --> 18:00.224
Hey, what gives?

18:01.966 --> 18:04.620
Twilight thought you might try
to show your faces around here,

18:04.771 --> 18:06.612
so she put up a force field.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.928
Aw, c'mon, Applejack!

18:11.079 --> 18:13.120
You're not mad at us too, are you?

18:13.271 --> 18:14.271
Yup.

18:14.422 --> 18:16.501
You're not even gonna talk to us?

18:16.652 --> 18:17.652
Nope.

18:18.103 --> 18:21.755
You should be ashamed of yourself,
humiliatin' your sister 'n' me like that.

18:21.906 --> 18:23.741
We don't wanna talk to
any y'all right now,

18:23.892 --> 18:26.930
so take your little gossip column
and your embarrassing photographs

18:27.081 --> 18:29.508
and just go away!

18:40.580 --> 18:45.150
We've ruined all of our friendships
and we still don't have our cutie marks!

18:45.301 --> 18:47.282
This is the worst day ever!

18:47.433 --> 18:49.625
Oh yeah? Wait 'til tomorrow.

18:49.776 --> 18:52.273
Our most embarrassing moments
are about to be published

18:52.424 --> 18:54.600
for everypony to laugh at.

18:54.751 --> 18:56.400
So, what do we do?

18:56.701 --> 18:57.919
I don't know.

18:58.070 --> 19:01.375
We're not leaving this clubhouse
until we think of something!

19:07.520 --> 19:10.100
That's it, Gabby Gums is out of time.

19:10.251 --> 19:11.451
Run these instead.

19:11.602 --> 19:15.213
I want this paper on every
street corner in Ponyville!

19:15.364 --> 19:16.664
Yes, ma'am!

19:17.335 --> 19:19.720
Stop the presses!

19:19.871 --> 19:22.040
Uh, they haven't started yet.

19:22.550 --> 19:25.248
We have a Gabby Gums column!

19:26.200 --> 19:28.982
You're lucky I'm nice.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.911
This better not happen again, or else.

19:41.350 --> 19:42.800
Well done, Diamond Tiara.

19:43.051 --> 19:47.637
You've averted yet another crisis
with your amazing diplomatic skills.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.379
<i>"An open letter to Ponyville
by Gabby Gums"?! </i>

19:52.630 --> 19:53.730
What is this?!

19:55.250 --> 19:57.377
They're not gonna get away with this!

19:57.528 --> 19:59.915
I'll publish those photos tomorrow!

20:00.066 --> 20:02.875
They messed with the wrong pony!

20:04.600 --> 20:06.923
<i>To the citizens of Ponyville.</i>

20:07.074 --> 20:10.639
<i>For some time now, you've been reading
this column to get the latest dirt </i>

20:10.790 --> 20:11.990
<i>and the hottest buzz.</i>

20:12.141 --> 20:14.407
<i>But this will be my final piece.</i>

20:14.558 --> 20:18.170
<i>We want to apologize for the pain
and embarrassment we've caused.</i>

20:18.321 --> 20:21.012
<i>Y'see, I'm actually three little fillies.</i>

20:21.163 --> 20:23.713
<i>Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo.</i>

20:25.150 --> 20:29.427
<i>As the popularity of our column grew,
we got swept up in the hype.</i>

20:29.578 --> 20:32.195
<i>We knew that what we were
doing didn't feel quite right,</i>

20:32.346 --> 20:34.700
<i>but we ignored the guilt,
because everypony </i>

20:34.851 --> 20:37.062
<i>seemed to want to read
what we were writing.</i>

20:38.076 --> 20:42.252
<i>From now on, we promise to respect
everypony else's privacy.</i>

20:42.403 --> 20:45.406
<i>and we won't engage
in hurtful gossip any more.</i>

20:45.557 --> 20:48.706
<i>All we can do is ask for
your forgiveness, Ponyville.</i>

20:49.257 --> 20:54.299
<i>Signing off for the very last time,
XOXO, Gabby Gums.</i>

20:55.780 --> 20:59.012
Well, staff, I guess I gave
a little too much authority

20:59.163 --> 21:00.663
to a first-time editor.

21:01.010 --> 21:05.004
I'm sorry, Diamond Tiara,
I have to strip you of your title.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.778
And for the next editor
of the Foal Free Press...

21:11.600 --> 21:15.720
Here's your new editor-in-chief,
Featherweight!

21:18.800 --> 21:21.816
Oh, him? But what about me?!

21:21.967 --> 21:26.558
Here ya go! I've been promoted
to staff photographer!
