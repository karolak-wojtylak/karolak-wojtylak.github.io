WEBVTT

00:09.160 --> 00:12.960
First lesson of the day. We
very carefully set the table

00:13.000 --> 00:15.700
without using magic
so that-- YIPES!

00:20.240 --> 00:22.080
Did you-- how-- when-- what?

00:22.780 --> 00:23.440
What?

00:24.040 --> 00:27.160
I said no magic. You were
supposed to do it by hoof

00:27.220 --> 00:29.080
so I could work in
a friendship lesson.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.540
Oh. I heard set the table
and just kinda went for it.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.720
Well, if you
hadn't used magic,

00:35.820 --> 00:37.700
you'd have heard
me say, uh,

00:38.360 --> 00:41.600
this plate represents your
head, this spoon is your heart

00:41.780 --> 00:46.140
and the knives... are sharp.
Always be careful with knives.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.020
The metaphors make more
sense when you're actually

00:50.140 --> 00:51.520
setting the table.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.780
Should I change it back?

00:54.120 --> 00:56.180
I just want to make sure
you're ready for this dinner.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.560
Princess Celestia will be
joining us tomorrow night

00:58.620 --> 01:00.360
to see how the friendship
lessons are going.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.900
If it's just you, me
and Princess Celestia,

01:03.940 --> 01:05.530
why are there
four seats?

01:05.880 --> 01:08.400
Well, the whole point is for
you to bring a new friend.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.520
That way the Princess
will see for herself

01:10.560 --> 01:11.670
just how far
you've come.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.240
And how good a
teacher you have.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.920
I can't choose. I
like all your friends.

01:17.180 --> 01:20.180
That's the best part. You
have to make a new friend.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.900
New friends?

01:23.780 --> 01:26.280
Hey, maybe I'll just
force friendships

01:26.320 --> 01:29.040
by magically enslaving
the entire population

01:29.080 --> 01:30.250
of Ponyville!

01:30.740 --> 01:32.020
Starlight!

01:32.540 --> 01:34.140
Kidding! Heh heh heh.

01:40.560 --> 01:53.020

We have muffins!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

02:14.200 --> 02:17.125
Let's see. Make new
friends in Ponyville,

02:17.150 --> 02:19.400
the friendliest
place in Equestria.

02:19.775 --> 02:21.025
Shouldn't be hard.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.725
Need to make a new
friend, huh?

02:22.775 --> 02:24.575
I know just the
pony for you!

02:25.725 --> 02:27.025
Ms. Starlight
Glimmer,

02:27.075 --> 02:28.150
meet Mrs. Cake.

02:32.025 --> 02:33.450
How are you, dearie?

02:33.950 --> 02:35.700
Are you baking?
Can I help?

02:42.875 --> 02:46.100
Wow. Mrs. Cake! Look what
your "new friend" made you.

02:46.825 --> 02:50.050
Ah ha ha! New friend? I like
the sound of that.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.725
Howza-whoza!

02:52.125 --> 02:53.725
Are you trying to put
me out of business

02:53.725 --> 02:56.050
with your fancy
magica-thingy-whatsit cake?

02:58.400 --> 02:59.375
Oh!

02:59.700 --> 03:01.100
Sorry!

03:04.900 --> 03:07.925
In her defense,
it is delicious.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.825
I think I have just the
pony for you, Starlight.

03:15.175 --> 03:16.250
Meet Big Mac.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.475
Eyup.

03:19.775 --> 03:21.150
He's not much
of a talker.

03:22.025 --> 03:23.360
Nope.

03:23.775 --> 03:26.750
Oh that's too bad. I
love a good conversation.

03:33.925 --> 03:38.125
Eyyyyyyyyup-yup-yeah-yeah-you
did something!

03:38.350 --> 03:40.850
Whoa! What's happening?
I feel really weird.

03:40.925 --> 03:43.025
I'm talking so much
and I'm so articulate

03:43.075 --> 03:45.225
enunciating with such
precise pronunciation!

03:47.300 --> 03:49.225
Annie Apple Awoke
And Accidentally Ate

03:49.250 --> 03:54.500
an Auburn Azalea!
Aaaah! MAKE IT STOP!

03:57.075 --> 03:59.575
I can't be friends with
somepony who doesn't talk.

04:01.550 --> 04:04.450
And I guess my first
instinct shouldn't be to

04:04.500 --> 04:06.875
magically command ponies to
act the way I want them to.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.575
All right! I'll
change him back!

04:11.950 --> 04:14.275
The trick to
finding a new friend

04:14.400 --> 04:16.450
is to render
yourself radiant.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.950
First impressions count
a great deal, you know.

04:19.375 --> 04:22.050
I'm glad you all got
past my first impression.

04:23.525 --> 04:25.525
Well, everypony deserves
a second chance!

04:25.675 --> 04:29.025
Oh now, I have a
top-notch idea.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.975
I'm thinking pastel
silk here and here,

04:32.175 --> 04:33.875
with crinoline underneath.

04:34.150 --> 04:36.500
You really think a new outfit
will help me meet ponies?

04:36.825 --> 04:40.150
Oh, with the right outfit,
you can do anything, darling.

04:41.000 --> 04:41.900
When will it be ready?

04:42.125 --> 04:42.975
Three weeks.

04:43.725 --> 04:45.010
Dinner's tomorrow.

04:45.650 --> 04:48.350
Well, then! How about
a hat from the, ahem,

04:48.575 --> 04:49.575
"clearance bin?"

04:56.400 --> 04:57.275
Maybe not.

04:59.325 --> 05:01.350
Nopony's gonna make
friends with you

05:01.425 --> 05:03.250
because of your outfit.

05:03.375 --> 05:07.700
The only thing you want a new
friend draped in is coolness.

05:07.875 --> 05:08.650
Like you?

05:08.825 --> 05:11.325
Yeah, but you already
know me, so...

05:12.025 --> 05:13.975
Spitfire!

05:14.975 --> 05:15.600
Sorry.

05:15.850 --> 05:16.740
Who's that?

05:17.450 --> 05:20.075
Only the Wonderboltiest
Pony in the Wonderbolts.

05:20.375 --> 05:21.625
Come on, I'll
introduce you!

05:25.850 --> 05:27.550
You coming or what?

05:28.075 --> 05:30.475
I guess my first
question would be...

05:30.675 --> 05:32.300
what's a Wonderbolt?

05:33.550 --> 05:36.200
You've never heard
of the Wonderbolts?

05:36.475 --> 05:37.950
Where have you been?

05:38.475 --> 05:41.525
Heh... enslaving
villages, I guess.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.900
Right.

05:46.325 --> 05:50.250
You're adorable, but probably
not what Twilight had in mind.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.725
What is going on?
This is Ponyville!

06:01.225 --> 06:02.625
If I can't make
a friend here,

06:02.625 --> 06:04.625
there's got to be
something wrong with me.

06:06.275 --> 06:08.025
OK. Calm down.

06:08.225 --> 06:10.625
Nobody makes friends
with a total stress case.

06:14.275 --> 06:18.025
Stop stressing!
STOP STRESSING!

06:35.325 --> 06:38.075
Ahhh. This is just
what I needed.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.665
Tell me about it.

06:41.175 --> 06:43.075
You ever have one
of those days?

06:43.450 --> 06:45.750
For me, they're all
one of those days.

06:45.875 --> 06:46.770
Ha-ha-ha.

06:47.075 --> 06:50.275
I'm going to start coming here
every time I visit Ponyville.

06:51.020 --> 06:54.125
I'm not from here either. I've
been trying to make friends,

06:54.125 --> 06:56.875
but it's not easy.
They're not saying it,

06:57.050 --> 06:59.450
but I think everypony
knows about my past.

06:59.850 --> 07:02.980
I... may have been
a tiny bit...

07:03.400 --> 07:05.275
...completely and
utterly evil?

07:05.700 --> 07:07.875
Ponies judge me on
my past, too.

07:09.425 --> 07:12.025
Finally, a pony I
can relate to.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.575
Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta
spoon, strawberry pick.

07:17.325 --> 07:19.275
I'm beginning to think
that after Friendship,

07:19.300 --> 07:20.875
the greatest magic
of all...

07:20.925 --> 07:23.775
is proper silverware
placement.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.750
Twilight, guess what!
I made a new friend!

07:27.000 --> 07:28.750
That's fantastic news.

07:29.025 --> 07:30.000
She's great!

07:30.100 --> 07:30.900
Great!

07:30.975 --> 07:31.975
She's powerful!

07:32.175 --> 07:33.025
Powerful?

07:33.200 --> 07:33.675
She's--

07:33.800 --> 07:36.425
<i> Hello, Princess.</i>

07:38.500 --> 07:39.475
Trixie?

07:44.325 --> 07:45.500
You know each other?

07:45.975 --> 07:47.200
You could say that.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.650
We've had our
differences.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.975
What matters is Twilight
gave me a second chance

07:53.050 --> 07:54.775
and I appreciate it.

07:59.775 --> 08:02.610
So, um, what brings
you to Ponyville?

08:02.650 --> 08:07.225
The great and powerful
Trixie has come to perform

08:07.225 --> 08:12.250
a new stage show of grand
illusion. I'm calling it

08:12.425 --> 08:15.625
"The Humble and
Penitent Trixie's

08:15.700 --> 08:17.950
Equestrian Apology Tour."

08:18.475 --> 08:19.630
That's kind of
a mouthful.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.800
It's a working title.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.150
Starlight? A moment?
Over here?

08:27.725 --> 08:30.050
I know I said make
friends with "anypony,"

08:30.100 --> 08:33.150
but... well, with Trixie's
past and your past,

08:33.425 --> 08:36.225
I'm not so sure she's
the best "first friend."

08:39.585 --> 08:43.021
But whatever she did,
you've forgiven her, right?

08:43.375 --> 08:44.150
Of course.

08:44.575 --> 08:45.550
It's just...

08:45.875 --> 08:47.725
She wasn't the
nicest pony.

08:48.375 --> 08:52.150
Well, you did say anypony
and I just assumed

08:52.175 --> 08:54.225
that you'd trust me
to make my own friends

08:54.275 --> 08:56.700
the way Princess
Celestia trusted you.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.170
You're
right. I trust you.

09:00.575 --> 09:02.040
Just be back in
time for the dinner.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.600
Thanks, Twilight.
You won't regret it.

09:07.550 --> 09:08.525
I hope not.

09:11.275 --> 09:12.175
Ugh.

09:14.175 --> 09:16.725
This Magic Show's gonna
be the greatest thing

09:16.750 --> 09:18.475
Ponyville's ever seen.

09:27.475 --> 09:30.850
Everypony always says they'll
give you a second chance,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.700
but deep down,
they never forget.

09:34.525 --> 09:36.075
That's what I'm
worried about.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.150
What is it?

09:38.579 --> 09:42.681
I heard what Twilight said
about me and she's right;

09:43.000 --> 09:44.500
I wasn't very nice.

09:44.925 --> 09:47.875
So, I'd understand if you
didn't want to be friends.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.700
Are you kidding?
You're the first pony

09:50.750 --> 09:53.525
I've met who has
any idea how I feel.

09:56.425 --> 09:58.760
Can you keep a secret?

09:58.950 --> 10:00.900
What are friends for?

10:01.975 --> 10:03.100
The things I've done,

10:03.400 --> 10:06.000
I did them because I
was jealous of Twilight.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.030
She's just the
best at everything

10:08.225 --> 10:10.700
and I wanted to beat
her at something.

10:11.350 --> 10:12.500
Your secret's
safe with me.

10:13.050 --> 10:14.050
Thanks.

10:14.525 --> 10:15.975
Wanna help me
unpack my wagon?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.875
I spend a lot of time on
the road with my wagon,

10:20.875 --> 10:23.575
so it might be
a tad messy.

10:24.025 --> 10:27.790
Maybe I can help. I'm pretty
good at organizing stuff.

10:28.050 --> 10:30.500
Magic props,
brainwashed crowds.

10:32.525 --> 10:37.525
Psssst! Psssst! Psssst!

10:38.550 --> 10:39.825
Shhhhh!

10:41.150 --> 10:44.270
Uh, I'll catch up. I think
there's something in my hoof.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.500
Sure, the wagon's right
around the corner.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.275
So. How's it going
with your new friend?

10:51.650 --> 10:54.750
Great. Thanks for asking in
a completely not creepy way.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.656
Because, you know, if it isn't
working out for any reason,

10:57.800 --> 10:59.700
I could introduce you
to my friend, here.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.500
Nice to meet you.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.063
No, no. You can
come out now.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.600
You like music, right?

11:08.800 --> 11:11.300
DJ-Pon3'd be the perfect
friend for tonight's

11:11.375 --> 11:14.100
incredibly important
dinner with Celestia.

11:14.625 --> 11:17.525
You know, if you decide to
make a last minute change.

11:17.925 --> 11:21.475
So... back at your castle
when you said, "I trust you,"

11:21.550 --> 11:23.725
you meant, "I
don't trust you."

11:24.325 --> 11:28.780
Who can really say who said
what? I know I can't. Can you?

11:30.600 --> 11:33.525
Starlight, I'm just trying
to look out for you.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.150
I appreciate it, but
you're wrong about Trixie.

11:37.275 --> 11:40.025
She's just like me. We
have a real connection.

11:40.500 --> 11:44.800
That's kind of what I'm afraid
of. OH! What about her!

11:47.175 --> 11:49.950
Please, Twilight! I know
you're trying to help,

11:50.125 --> 11:52.740
but I need to make
friends on my own

11:52.750 --> 11:54.625
if I'm going to
become a better pony.

11:54.950 --> 11:56.825
But do you really
think Trixie is the one

11:56.825 --> 11:57.975
to help you with that?

11:58.475 --> 12:00.475
Wow, Trixie was right.

12:00.675 --> 12:02.925
You're not really giving
her a second chance.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.150
I wonder what that says
about how you feel about me.

12:11.025 --> 12:13.490
Oh! Now he'd be PERFECT!

12:13.900 --> 12:14.730
Ugh.

12:20.525 --> 12:21.750
I was thinking.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.475
You said Twilight is better
than you at everything,

12:24.700 --> 12:27.525
but that's not true.
You're better at magic.

12:27.825 --> 12:30.125
Only when I'm wearing a
soul-sucking evil amulet,

12:30.300 --> 12:31.925
so I don't think
that counts.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.650
Funny story. Don't
need to get into it.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.520
I meant stage magic.

12:36.725 --> 12:42.300
Well, of course. Great?
Yes. Powerful? Obviously.

12:42.475 --> 12:44.675
But I'm not the best.

12:44.975 --> 12:47.360
As great and powerful
as I am,

12:47.550 --> 12:51.025
there's one trick I've
never been able to do.

12:51.550 --> 12:54.500
The Moon-shot
Manticore Mouth Dive.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.970
Only one magician has
ever pulled it off:

12:59.175 --> 13:01.650
my hero, Hoofdini.

13:02.450 --> 13:05.400
You are supposed to blast
yourself into the open mouth

13:05.475 --> 13:07.375
of a hungry Manticore.

13:08.300 --> 13:11.000
After the Manticore chews
you up and swallows you,

13:11.050 --> 13:13.175
you magically step
out of a box

13:13.200 --> 13:15.100
on the other side
of the stage.

13:17.850 --> 13:19.650
Completely unharmed.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.500
That sounds very...

13:21.575 --> 13:22.325
Dangerous?

13:22.550 --> 13:24.275
I was going to
say, "cool."

13:24.800 --> 13:26.930
I knew I liked you
for a reason.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.625
I don't know how he did it.

13:30.925 --> 13:33.775
If I tried it, I'd get
chewed up and swallowed

13:33.800 --> 13:34.825
by that Manticore.

13:35.325 --> 13:37.650
Not if you could
use real magic.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.625
Obviously. Way
to rub it in.

13:40.975 --> 13:44.575
No, I mean I could help.
You could start the trick

13:44.800 --> 13:46.075
and right before
you got chewed up,

13:46.350 --> 13:47.950
I could use magic
to save you

13:48.750 --> 13:51.090
and make you appear
in the black box.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.425
I guess that would work.

13:53.850 --> 13:57.900
But if you made one
mistake, I'd be a goner.

13:58.775 --> 14:02.040
When it comes to magic,
I don't make mistakes.

14:02.225 --> 14:05.625
Maybe I could be your...
"magic-show-helper-pony?"

14:05.800 --> 14:09.410
We call it "assistant" in
the magician biz and...

14:09.625 --> 14:12.325
nopony's ever offered
to help before.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.100
Well, I'd be honored.

14:14.850 --> 14:18.325
You may have just made my
great and powerful magic show

14:18.350 --> 14:21.500
even better, which I
didn't think was possible.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.825
We're gonna blow
them away tonight!

14:25.825 --> 14:28.650
Oh, I can't. Tonight's this

14:28.675 --> 14:31.330
"incredibly important"
dinner with Twilight.

14:31.800 --> 14:32.725
Oh.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.900
Can I vent for a minute?

14:36.100 --> 14:37.440
What are friends for?

14:37.625 --> 14:40.025
Even after Twilight
says she trusts me,

14:40.075 --> 14:41.975
she clearly doesn't
trust me enough

14:42.025 --> 14:43.775
to choose my own friends.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.725
I guess you were right.
No second chances.

14:48.225 --> 14:51.950
I wish I could say
I was surprised.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.825
Well, lucky for
"Princess" Twilight

14:55.875 --> 14:58.350
I have my magic
show tonight.

14:58.650 --> 15:01.075
If you have to go
to the dinner,

15:01.160 --> 15:03.200
I completely understand.

15:03.675 --> 15:06.400
I just hope I find
a way to survive

15:06.475 --> 15:11.140
the Moon-Shot Manticore Mouth
Dive without my new assistant.

15:22.775 --> 15:26.290
Starlight Glimmer should
be here any minute.

15:26.675 --> 15:30.150
Any... minute...
now.

15:31.825 --> 15:34.150
How about I
introduce everyone?

15:34.625 --> 15:38.025
Our friendship lessons
are going so well.

15:38.325 --> 15:40.400
She made three
new friends!

15:41.925 --> 15:43.950
She has such great
taste in friends.

15:44.225 --> 15:46.375
I don't know where she
would have learned that.

15:47.275 --> 15:50.900
Starlight Glimmer? I thought
you said nose-hair trimmers!

15:51.000 --> 15:54.975
What's going on? I'm hungry!
And my nose is too hairy!

15:56.650 --> 16:00.390
HAHA! Cranky Doodle,
you're so funny!

16:00.675 --> 16:03.100
If you'll excuse me, I'm
going to check the kitchen.

16:03.450 --> 16:07.650
Maybe she got lost amongst
the... artichokes.

16:10.925 --> 16:13.275
Starlight? Has anyone
seen Starlight Glimmer?

16:13.700 --> 16:15.000
I'm looking for her.

16:18.450 --> 16:19.700
Trixie!

16:20.925 --> 16:23.600
So this is the "The Humble
and Penitent Trixie's

16:23.650 --> 16:25.210
Equestrian Apology Tour."

16:25.400 --> 16:27.275
Ain't that a
mouthful of molasses.

16:28.350 --> 16:29.550
It's a working title.

16:29.925 --> 16:33.200
This is going to be the
greatest night of my life.

16:33.725 --> 16:36.120
Excuse me, our lives.

16:36.275 --> 16:39.225
I'm so glad that we're
not at that boring dinner.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.525
Ahem.

16:41.475 --> 16:44.575
You just decided to skip our
dinner without telling me?

16:44.850 --> 16:46.875
Are you aware that
at this very moment,

16:46.975 --> 16:49.725
Princess Celestia is
waiting for you at a table--

16:49.975 --> 16:52.275
--with exquisite
silverware placement?

16:52.550 --> 16:53.625
Yes, but...

16:53.675 --> 16:55.275
This is exactly why

16:55.300 --> 16:56.850
I didn't want you to make
friends with Trixie.

16:57.175 --> 17:00.475
Ah-HA! You still
don't trust me!

17:00.725 --> 17:02.725
But guess what, "princess?"

17:02.825 --> 17:05.350
It doesn't matter if you want
to give me a second chance

17:05.400 --> 17:09.660
or not. Starlight had to
choose between you and me

17:09.975 --> 17:16.260
and she chose me! Your pupil
chose me! So HA. I win!

17:17.100 --> 17:21.300
You win? That sounds like you
just made friends with me

17:21.425 --> 17:22.500
to beat Twilight.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.275
Exactly!

17:25.600 --> 17:30.775
Wait. I mean, no! I got caught
up in the moment. I like you.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.500
Beating Twilight
is just a bonus.

17:32.650 --> 17:34.775
Oh, saying that
didn't help, did it.

17:36.050 --> 17:39.025
I should have known.
Nopony else in Ponyville

17:39.050 --> 17:41.650
wanted to be my
friend. Why would you?

17:42.725 --> 17:46.760
Wait! It's not like
that! I am your friend!

17:47.375 --> 17:48.660
Oh.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.100
Well, you "won." I
hope you're happy.

17:52.325 --> 17:56.475
Looks like the great
and powerful Trixie

17:56.500 --> 17:58.750
is back to a solo show...

18:00.050 --> 18:00.875
Trixie?

18:01.575 --> 18:05.410
...which is exactly
the way she likes it.

18:05.775 --> 18:08.075
Thank you,
Princess Twilight,

18:08.100 --> 18:10.075
for getting rid of
that annoying pony

18:10.125 --> 18:14.300
who wanted to be my first
friend. I am not sad at all.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.350
I definitely don't feel
like my heart is breaking

18:17.400 --> 18:18.850
into a million pieces.

18:24.150 --> 18:27.425
Come one, come all!
Come and see

18:27.475 --> 18:31.125
"The Pathetic and Friendless
Trixie's Way-To-Go-Dumb-Dumb

18:31.150 --> 18:34.840
You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-
Time Repentance Tour."

18:37.325 --> 18:39.225
IT'S A WORKING TITLE!

18:40.050 --> 18:43.025
Behold, your fears come true...

18:43.125 --> 18:45.120
a pony-eating MANTICORE,

18:48.475 --> 18:51.225
for tonight, the great
and powerful Trixie

18:51.225 --> 18:55.300
will be performing the
Moon-shot Manticore Mouth Dive.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.450
Now, now. Save your gasps
for when I defy the beast's

19:01.525 --> 19:05.875
jaws of doom and appear
inside that black box.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.450
I was supposed to
perform this trick

19:08.475 --> 19:10.975
with my great and
powerful assistant,

19:11.300 --> 19:14.250
who was also my great
and powerful friend.

19:18.875 --> 19:21.500
Starlight? When I first
came to Ponyville,

19:21.700 --> 19:24.620
Princess Celestia gave me
room to make my own decisions

19:24.975 --> 19:28.160
and my own friends. I need to
give you the same freedom.

19:28.475 --> 19:29.225
I shouldn't have tried

19:29.275 --> 19:30.750
to pick and choose
your friends for you.

19:34.225 --> 19:36.975
Just like me, you have to
make your own decisions...

19:37.200 --> 19:38.525
and your own friends.

19:39.950 --> 19:43.880
But, what if Trixie really was
using me just to one up you?

19:44.250 --> 19:46.725
From what I've seen...
she's the real thing.

19:50.850 --> 19:53.750
But it's not my place to
judge. It's all up to you.

19:58.425 --> 20:01.075
Starlight? If
you're out there

20:01.325 --> 20:02.975
and you still want
to be friends,

20:03.425 --> 20:06.400
let's be great and
powerful together.

20:07.075 --> 20:07.850
Please.

20:14.575 --> 20:15.400
Ahhhhh!

20:26.020 --> 20:31.350
Behold, the pate and
growerful Triskee!

20:44.600 --> 20:46.925
And now, I'm proud
to introduce

20:47.000 --> 20:49.750
my great and powerful
assistant...

20:50.120 --> 20:54.425
and best friend...
Starlight Glimmer!

20:59.275 --> 21:00.125
Trixie!

21:00.400 --> 21:01.675
What do you want?

21:01.950 --> 21:04.075
I was wrong,
I'm sorry.

21:04.625 --> 21:05.960
And I have to hand
it to you.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.300
I could never have pulled
off a trick like that.

21:10.925 --> 21:13.400
Thank you... Princess.

21:27.625 --> 21:30.550
How do you get yer hair
to do that all the time?
