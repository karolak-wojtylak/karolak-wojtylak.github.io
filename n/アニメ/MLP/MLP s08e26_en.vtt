WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.772
Magic is disappearing
all across Equestria.

00:06.874 --> 00:09.841
Didn't we learn about a
creature that<i> eats</i> magic?

00:09.943 --> 00:11.643
Somepony should investigate.

00:11.745 --> 00:12.444
We'll go.

00:12.546 --> 00:13.979
I thought
Starlight Glimmer

00:14.081 --> 00:15.981
was going to be
temporary Head Mare.

00:16.083 --> 00:19.251
With Equestria under attack,
Ponies must stand together!

00:19.353 --> 00:22.221
I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
My friends are in trouble!

00:22.323 --> 00:26.125
It seems my little protégé's
plan worked after all.

00:26.227 --> 00:29.795
The future empress
of friendship!

00:29.897 --> 00:33.998
Hahaha!

01:12.039 --> 01:14.073
Cozy Glow is
behind all of this!?

01:14.675 --> 01:15.975
Ha ha ha ha!

01:16.177 --> 01:19.479
I'm not usually a
fan of ponies,

01:19.881 --> 01:23.382
but draining your
precious world of magic

01:23.584 --> 01:27.720
so she could trap the six
of you was inspiring!

01:27.822 --> 01:30.022
Ha ha ha ha!

01:30.624 --> 01:32.659
Um... there's
seven of us.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.161
I knew we shouldn't have left!

01:35.263 --> 01:37.396
But Starlight's in
charge at the school.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.099
If anypony can stop
Cozy Glow, it's her.

01:40.301 --> 01:43.202
Tirek: Cozy Glow
outsmarted the six of you.

01:43.304 --> 01:47.239
I doubt this "Starlight"
stands a chance. [cough]

01:47.541 --> 01:48.908
We have to get out of here.

01:49.010 --> 01:51.277
Our students can't
handle Cozy on their own.

01:51.379 --> 01:54.446
Then I guess we'll just
have to bust our way out!

01:59.954 --> 02:03.021
[groan] That didn't work. [groan]

02:03.624 --> 02:05.791
Not everything can be
solved with brute force.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.895
We need magic to escape.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.530
Maybe there's a way to
get out without magic.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.766
Like a secret lever,
or a secret button,

02:14.068 --> 02:16.502
or a secret admirer who knows a
secret about you, but is all,

02:16.604 --> 02:18.637
"Your secret's safe with me
because I put it in Tartarus

02:18.739 --> 02:19.972
and I have a key."

02:20.174 --> 02:21.207
I'm afraid not.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.876
The most powerful villains and
monsters of all time

02:23.978 --> 02:25.044
are trapped here.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.680
And without our
magic, so are we.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.518
Unless...

02:34.922 --> 02:37.289
...These creatures might be
losing their magical powers,

02:37.391 --> 02:40.159
but there's still a magic
that makes up what they are.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.894
Maybe we can borrow
some of that!

02:46.300 --> 02:48.267
Uh, excuse me?

02:48.469 --> 02:49.970
Um, Chancellor Neighsay?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.872
You might as well get used
to calling me

02:52.974 --> 02:54.440
Headstallion Neighsay.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.709
I plan to be here
for quite some time.

02:57.111 --> 03:00.980
Gee, it sure is a relief
to have somepony in charge,

03:01.282 --> 03:03.282
what with the magical
crisis going on,

03:03.484 --> 03:07.653
and we're all so grateful to
you for taking care of those..

03:07.755 --> 03:11.191
non-ponies, but doesn't
the EEA need you?

03:11.793 --> 03:15.060
What the EEA needs is somepony
to protect this school

03:15.162 --> 03:17.129
from the threats at
Equestria's borders

03:17.231 --> 03:20.166
instead of gallivanting off
on adventures beyond them.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.902
Twilight didn't just
run off willy-nilly.

03:23.004 --> 03:24.837
She left ME in charge.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.439
I'm her right-hoof-mare!

03:27.041 --> 03:29.408
Another in a long
list of mistakes

03:29.510 --> 03:31.811
the "Princess of
Friendship" has made.

03:32.113 --> 03:34.814
Rest assured, from now on this
school shall be run

03:34.916 --> 03:37.282
according to strict
EEA guidelines...

03:39.053 --> 03:40.653
the way it always
should have been.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.856
Well, that sounds just peachy...

03:44.992 --> 03:47.024
...Headstallion Neighsay!

03:50.531 --> 03:54.300
Sweetie Belle: Cozy Glow did
all of this? How? Why?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.668
I don't know, but
come on, y'all.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.438
We gotta get Starlight out of
there before she comes back!

03:59.940 --> 04:00.806
Sandbar: Wait!

04:05.746 --> 04:06.545
Sweetie Belle!

04:06.647 --> 04:07.513
HELP!

04:12.319 --> 04:15.421
That's gotta be what's sucking
up all the magic in Equestria!

04:15.623 --> 04:17.923
But if that's true, then
Twilight and the others

04:18.025 --> 04:19.525
went to Tartarus for nothing.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.995
And if all of Equestria's magic
is getting sucked up in there,

04:23.097 --> 04:24.864
there's no way for
them to get back!

04:25.766 --> 04:26.834
We need to get help!

04:26.958 --> 04:28.735
But Starlight's trapped here,

04:28.836 --> 04:32.338
and there's no way to get word
to Celestia or anypony else!

04:32.840 --> 04:34.506
I guess we're on our own...

04:42.116 --> 04:43.716
Still locked, huh?

04:44.018 --> 04:45.851
We've gotta at least
try to get out.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.420
Why? If Sandbar's
turned his back on us,

04:48.522 --> 04:50.789
every other pony
probably has too.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.824
Sandbar not turn his back!

04:53.026 --> 04:54.660
Sandbar is our friend.

04:54.762 --> 04:57.096
Uh, Did you miss the part where
he said he didn't want

04:57.198 --> 04:58.798
anything to do with us?

04:59.700 --> 05:02.501
Maybe he just said that so one
of us could be free to snoop

05:02.603 --> 05:05.004
around and figure
out what's going on!

05:05.106 --> 05:06.739
[window opens]
Sandbar: I don't know...

05:07.141 --> 05:10.276
That sounds too clever for
a pony to come up with.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.811
Ya ha ha ha!

05:13.013 --> 05:15.748
Yona knew Sandbar
was still our friend!

05:16.350 --> 05:17.416
We all are.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.951
Except for Cozy Glow.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.353
That pony is NOT who
we thought she was.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.022
She's the one draining
magic out of Equestria!

05:24.324 --> 05:25.391
WHAT?

05:25.593 --> 05:27.459
We'll explain on the
way, but right now,

05:27.561 --> 05:29.461
we've gotta get to
Chancellor Neighsay.

05:30.062 --> 05:30.640
Huh?

05:31.165 --> 05:33.132
I know he doesn't
like non-ponies,

05:33.234 --> 05:35.300
but if we tell him what's
going on, he'll help.

05:37.805 --> 05:41.540
I'm sure you're all concerned
about the magic situation,

05:41.642 --> 05:45.611
but I want to assure you that
this institution is safe,

05:45.713 --> 05:47.780
despite the absence
of your Headmare.

05:48.082 --> 05:51.417
As your new Headstallion, let
me be the first to say

05:51.519 --> 05:55.020
that the reign of Princess
Twilight is OVER!

05:55.322 --> 05:58.857
From now on, this school will
adhere to EEA doctrine

05:59.059 --> 06:01.593
as it should have
from the start!

06:06.400 --> 06:08.934
Thank you, Chancellor Neighsay,
for that rousing speech.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.307
I know you're a stallion who
truly believes what you say.

06:12.709 --> 06:14.775
And when you say this
school will be run

06:14.877 --> 06:18.545
according to EEA doctrine,
I know you mean it.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.347
And.. when you say there won't
be any more lessons

06:22.449 --> 06:25.617
from the Princess of Friendship
at the School of Friendship,

06:25.719 --> 06:27.085
I guess you mean that too.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.255
That's not exact--

06:30.357 --> 06:33.024
But! Twilight decided
to run her school

06:33.126 --> 06:35.160
outside of the EEA guidelines.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.296
And even though you
tried to stop her,

06:37.398 --> 06:39.931
Princesses Celestia and
Luna trusted her enough

06:40.033 --> 06:41.034
to support her.

06:42.636 --> 06:43.669
Well, I wouldn't say--

06:43.771 --> 06:46.572
So since I know you
mean what you say,

06:46.774 --> 06:49.375
my question is really
for the students.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.644
Are we going to give the pony
who already tried to wreck

06:52.746 --> 06:56.215
Twilight's school once
<i>another</i> chance to do it?

06:59.787 --> 07:03.155
I guess things will have to stay
the way Twilight wants them,

07:03.257 --> 07:06.225
which includes
leaving me in charge.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.092
All: Yeah!

07:09.242 --> 07:09.942
Neighsay: I can-

07:13.767 --> 07:17.036
OK, so maybe we need a new plan...

07:23.844 --> 07:25.210
Oh, oh, not too tight.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.978
We don't want to
hurt the Chancellor.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.282
I'm sure Twilight will
know what to do with him

07:30.384 --> 07:31.317
when she gets back.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.085
Now, back to class everyone.

07:34.187 --> 07:37.288
We've let the EEA disrupt our
friendship studies long enough.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.362
Why are you doing this?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.130
I thought you wanted
to have somepony

07:45.232 --> 07:46.498
in charge of the school.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.668
Oh, I do! You just aren't
the pony I had in mind.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.941
I can't very well have the
EEA running the school

07:56.043 --> 07:57.842
if I want to run it myself.

07:58.544 --> 08:00.445
Of course, that's
just the beginning.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.348
You see, if there's one
thing I've learned here,

08:03.450 --> 08:07.586
it's that friendship is the
most powerful thing there is,

08:07.788 --> 08:10.722
and as Headmare of the
School of Friendship,

08:10.924 --> 08:14.359
nopony will have more
friends than me!

08:14.661 --> 08:19.531
Making me the most
powerful pony in Equestria!

08:27.040 --> 08:29.073
Hey, Cozy Glow.
What's so funny?

08:29.109 --> 08:31.176
Are you just happy to
be running the school?

08:31.978 --> 08:34.279
Oh, I'm just keeping
Twilight's seat warm.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.415
Still, it's pretty impressive!

08:37.517 --> 08:39.050
Is there anything
we can do to help?

08:39.152 --> 08:42.454
We can hang out with
you all day if you want.

08:42.756 --> 08:46.324
You know, there is
something I need help with.

08:46.626 --> 08:47.759
Yay! Whoo-hoo! Awesome!

08:58.839 --> 09:00.505
Oh. Wonderful.

09:00.607 --> 09:02.974
I suppose you've
all come to gloat.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.546
Actually, we've come to undo
all these chains and free you!

09:07.848 --> 09:09.348
But.. why?

09:09.550 --> 09:12.851
Now that nasty pony
met even nastier pony,

09:12.953 --> 09:16.120
maybe nasty pony
not be so nasty.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.094
Also, we'd kinda
like to stop Cozy

09:23.196 --> 09:25.497
before she drains all the
magic from Equestria.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.300
She's behind that as well?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.969
I must get word to
Celestia and Luna.

09:31.905 --> 09:35.206
How? Without magic, it'll
take forever to get to them.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.876
While it's true that unicorns
have lost their ability

09:37.978 --> 09:41.046
to cast spells, the most
potent magic in Equestria

09:41.148 --> 09:44.115
is housed in our... artifacts!

09:45.852 --> 09:49.621
The EEA medallion allows me to
travel throughout Equestria.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.790
Its magic worked when
I chained you up,

09:51.892 --> 09:54.959
perhaps it still has enough
to send me to the Princesses.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.805
I hope he makes it.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.407
I hope he doesn't come
back and lock us up again.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.942
<i>If</i> he comes back.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.411
Everything's
gonna be fine!

10:13.513 --> 10:16.481
Twilight and the others are
probably already on their way.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.524
Are you sure there's
magic in Cerberus?

10:25.726 --> 10:27.259
Clarissa the pig has two tails,

10:27.361 --> 10:29.160
and while her singing
voice is lovely,

10:29.462 --> 10:31.363
I don't think
it's magical.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.998
We need to try everything if
we want to get out of here.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.768
I don't know;
Tartarus isn't so bad.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.904
I could hang out
here for a while.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.776
Eh. Maybe not
forever, though.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.879
Tirek: But that is just
what it will be!

10:48.281 --> 10:53.251
If my protege has followed my
instructions, by sunset tonight,

10:53.453 --> 10:56.354
every last vestige
of Equestrian magic

10:56.556 --> 10:59.991
will disappear into
the ether.. FOREVER!

11:00.393 --> 11:03.128
Have you even thought about
what losing magic would mean?

11:03.230 --> 11:07.432
It means the six of you will be
trapped here, like me!

11:07.534 --> 11:08.867
Spike: Seven!

11:09.069 --> 11:10.001
Exactly.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.402
It means you're trapped here.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.204
Forever. With US.

11:14.575 --> 11:18.175
Ahh.. I hadn't thought
of it like that...

11:19.446 --> 11:21.613
So what do we do, Twilight?

11:21.715 --> 11:24.516
Dash and Applejack nearly
have Cerberus tired out.

11:24.618 --> 11:27.552
If Rarity pitches in, I think
they can get him to sit still

11:27.654 --> 11:30.022
long enough to try
what I have in mind.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.458
I'm sure I can get the
other monsters to help.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.495
Besides, I would NEVER
call them monsters.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.296
What about Tirek?

11:38.598 --> 11:40.598
He's probably got
some magic too, right?

11:40.900 --> 11:42.168
Leave him to me.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.304
Dooowwwn...

11:46.906 --> 11:48.373
OK, everyone!

11:48.475 --> 11:51.376
Time to show Equestria
that you aren't "monsters"

11:51.478 --> 11:54.079
You're wonderful,
mystical creatures!

11:54.881 --> 11:57.081
<i> ♪ I know it's not</i>
<i> your birthday so, ♪</i>

11:57.183 --> 11:58.616
<i> ♪ you get a party</i>
<i> even though, ♪</i>

11:58.718 --> 12:00.185
<i> ♪ we'll sing and dance</i>
<i> from one to ten, ♪</i>

12:00.287 --> 12:02.121
<i> ♪ and then we'll do</i>
<i> it all again! ♪</i>

12:02.723 --> 12:06.024
More tea, Princess Pudding Rock?

12:06.526 --> 12:10.862
"Oh, don't mind if I do!"
Heh heh.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.333
I can do this <i>all eternity.</i>

12:14.935 --> 12:16.935
FINE! I'll help you leave.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.403
Just please stop!

12:18.505 --> 12:19.771
Tirek's in!

12:20.373 --> 12:23.908
It's just so excitin' to have
a foal our age runnin' things.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.311
We should have an ice
cream social every day!

12:26.513 --> 12:29.147
That's a splendid
idea, Apple Bloom.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.615
But to tell you the truth,

12:30.717 --> 12:33.118
the thing I need help
with most is cleaning.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.120
Say no more. Just take
us around the school

12:36.222 --> 12:38.723
and show us everything
you want cleaned.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.025
Well, actually, you can
start right in here.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.796
It looks pretty clean already.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.433
Do you three think
you can fool me!?

12:48.735 --> 12:50.601
I know a diversion
when I see it.

12:52.773 --> 12:56.141
Uh. Why pony lead us back down here?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.977
We obviously can't
handle Cozy on our own,

12:59.279 --> 13:00.879
but we can't just sit
around and wait for help.

13:00.981 --> 13:04.482
So, there's one more prisoner
I think we should free.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.151
Ooh! I guess Starlight.
Is it Starlight?

13:10.723 --> 13:12.390
Counselor pony come out!

13:12.492 --> 13:14.358
We need help with nasty pony!

13:18.298 --> 13:20.164
She can't talk to
us from in there.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.833
We'll have to figure
a way to get her out.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.806
Hey! This is just like
chapter twelve in

13:28.908 --> 13:31.475
Kanthaka's Facts & Artifacts,
from Twilight's class.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.913
What? I've
been studying.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.147
Finals are coming
up, you know.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.249
Actually, I remember that too!

13:38.351 --> 13:39.784
Cozy must have linked
these artifacts

13:39.886 --> 13:41.452
to act like a mystical magnet,

13:41.654 --> 13:44.723
attracting all the magic
in Equestria into that orb!

13:45.125 --> 13:46.290
So, we can shut it down

13:46.392 --> 13:48.226
by yanking one of these
things out, right?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.595
Sure, though, that would
probably cause a magical

13:50.697 --> 13:53.364
feedback loop and
destroy the whole school!

13:53.466 --> 13:55.666
Cozy: Destroy the
School of Friendship?

13:55.968 --> 13:56.968
Oh, dear...

13:57.270 --> 13:59.738
Chancellor Neighsay was
wrong about a lot of things,

13:59.840 --> 14:02.340
but I guess he was
right about all of you.

14:06.312 --> 14:07.045
All right.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.479
Is everypony ready?

14:10.450 --> 14:11.849
Siiiit!

14:11.951 --> 14:12.651
Good!

14:12.853 --> 14:14.352
I can't say for how much longer..

14:17.257 --> 14:19.958
All eternity!

14:20.160 --> 14:21.259
YES, by all means!

14:21.361 --> 14:22.793
Please, just get on with it!

14:23.863 --> 14:24.596
Ahem.

14:24.898 --> 14:28.499
There's your cue, you
evil centaur, you.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.381
That's it!

14:43.483 --> 14:44.882
I think its working!

14:49.656 --> 14:50.355
Come on!

14:50.457 --> 14:52.190
I don't know how
long I can hold it!

14:53.293 --> 14:54.926
Good boy!

14:55.428 --> 14:56.795
Bye friends!

14:57.097 --> 14:59.664
Hopefully we'll be able to turn
you all back into your normal

14:59.766 --> 15:01.499
wonderful selves soon.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.534
Thanks for the
assist, Your Redness!

15:10.843 --> 15:13.178
Yay! Twilight did it!

15:13.380 --> 15:15.646
I couldn't have done it
without all your help.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.148
I'm not sure we did!

15:19.285 --> 15:20.185
NO!

15:20.587 --> 15:24.055
Tirek said all of Equestria's
magic would be gone at sunset.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.890
Without magic, there's
no way we'll get back

15:25.992 --> 15:27.258
to the school in time.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.893
What does that mean?

15:29.195 --> 15:31.361
It means... we failed.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.402
After everything
Twilight's done for you,

15:37.804 --> 15:40.438
why would you want
to destroy her school?

15:40.840 --> 15:41.973
WE don't!

15:42.175 --> 15:43.541
You're the one using
these artifacts

15:43.643 --> 15:45.443
to drain magic from Equestria.

15:45.745 --> 15:46.444
Me?

15:46.546 --> 15:49.214
We all just saw you with
your claws all over them!

15:50.316 --> 15:51.883
[gasp] It all makes sense.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.719
These creatures want magic
gone from Equestria

15:54.821 --> 15:57.922
because it's the only thing
ponies have that they don't!

15:58.324 --> 16:00.358
Technically, there's
a magical component

16:00.460 --> 16:02.093
when Silversteam
and I transform.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.962
And Yona's friends'
friendship IS magic.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.197
Twilight said!

16:06.299 --> 16:08.333
And you repaid her by
sending her to Tartarus

16:08.435 --> 16:10.334
on a wild goose chase
so you could destroy

16:10.436 --> 16:12.037
everything she's built!

16:12.639 --> 16:15.406
Ah! They've even trapped
Starlight in that.. that thing!

16:15.908 --> 16:18.108
We have to defend the school!

16:19.412 --> 16:21.579
No! No! Don't listen to her!

16:25.618 --> 16:26.450
Aaaah!

16:27.152 --> 16:28.051
Gallus!

16:43.403 --> 16:46.537
They just sacrificed themselves
trying to save their friend...

16:46.739 --> 16:48.472
Professor Dash always
says there's nothing

16:48.574 --> 16:50.041
more loyal than that.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.010
Shouldn't <i>we</i> try to save them?

16:52.112 --> 16:53.678
They brought this on themselves.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.179
There's nothing we can do.

16:55.381 --> 16:58.249
That doesn't seem very
generous or kind.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.684
Yeah, yeah...

16:59.786 --> 17:02.520
The Elements of Harmony
are very important.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.056
They're just not applicable
in every circumstance.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.058
And with magic gone
from Equestria,

17:07.160 --> 17:08.593
I'm not even sure
the Tree of Harmony

17:08.695 --> 17:10.462
will be as helpful
as it once was.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.169
What's happening!?

17:24.210 --> 17:26.110
They're glowing
like the Elements!

17:26.212 --> 17:28.413
I think the Tree of
Harmony saved them!

17:29.215 --> 17:32.083
Guess our friendship is
pretty magical after all.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.385
Hurry, grab the artifacts!

17:37.457 --> 17:40.892
Um... didn't you say that
could DESTROY the school?

17:40.994 --> 17:43.661
But if we don't try, we
could lose magic forever.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.265
You all better get clear.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.968
Wait! Where are you going!?

18:24.137 --> 18:25.370
Counselor Pony!

18:25.472 --> 18:27.906
Uh.. It's nice to see you too.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.740
I guess magic is back.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.276
Cozy: You've
ruined everything!

18:32.478 --> 18:34.245
Now Twilight and her
ridiculous friends

18:34.347 --> 18:35.880
can escape from Tartarus!

18:40.019 --> 18:42.019
I mean... Yay!

18:42.121 --> 18:43.388
All my friends are safe!

18:43.690 --> 18:46.324
You can drop the ACT, Cozy Glow.

18:46.426 --> 18:50.428
Your pen pal, Tirek, told us
all about how he helped YOU

18:50.530 --> 18:52.363
suck up all that magic.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.532
But I still don't
understand why.

18:55.835 --> 18:59.003
WHY!? Because
friendship is power!

18:59.105 --> 19:00.871
You might be the
Princess of Friendship,

19:00.973 --> 19:03.040
but as Headmare
of this school,

19:03.142 --> 19:05.910
I can collect even
more friends than you!

19:08.081 --> 19:10.014
You're the one who
doesn't get it, Cozy.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.949
Friendship IS powerful,

19:12.051 --> 19:14.485
but power isn't why
you make friends.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.721
I'm sorry I couldn't
teach you that.

19:17.623 --> 19:19.023
Gallus: Well, you taught US!

19:19.225 --> 19:22.794
You can't let one bad apple
make you think you failed.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.562
And we never could
have stopped her

19:24.664 --> 19:26.831
if we hadn't learned what you
taught us about friendship.

19:27.133 --> 19:27.965
Cozy: Honesty?

19:28.067 --> 19:28.899
Loyalty?

19:29.001 --> 19:29.767
Generosity?

19:29.969 --> 19:31.002
Blah blah blah...

19:31.104 --> 19:33.471
I can make more friends
without using any of them.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.275
And if I can't do it here,
I'll do it somewhere else!

19:37.577 --> 19:39.743
Yeah. I don't think so.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.323
[sigh] I'm glad you are
back in charge

19:52.425 --> 19:54.325
of the School of
Friendship, Princess.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.830
It's clear to me now that there
is no pony better suited

19:59.932 --> 20:00.931
for the job.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.338
What's going on!?

20:07.740 --> 20:09.040
Hi, Headmare Twilight.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.510
We're just practicing
for graduation.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.779
Graduation..?

20:15.181 --> 20:16.514
Now that we've
saved Equestria,

20:16.616 --> 20:18.149
we figured we were
done with school.

20:21.421 --> 20:24.221
Saving Equestria is nice, but
I'm afraid it'll take

20:24.323 --> 20:25.790
more than one semester to learn

20:25.892 --> 20:27.692
all there is to know
about friendship.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.259
[belch] Told ya!

20:29.361 --> 20:31.195
AWWWWWW!

20:31.497 --> 20:33.231
Your Headmare is right.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.066
I thought friendship was
something that only ponies

20:36.168 --> 20:37.668
should share with each other,

20:37.870 --> 20:40.338
but you all taught
me how wrong I was.

20:40.740 --> 20:44.675
I suppose true friendship can
take a lifetime to understand.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.512
If it were easy to learn,
we wouldn't need a school.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.114
[crash] Woah!

20:50.216 --> 20:52.250
We held her off as
long as we could!

20:52.352 --> 20:54.185
But she locked us
in this closet!

20:54.287 --> 20:55.920
What happened! Is
everything all right!?

20:56.022 --> 20:57.054
Where's Cozy Glow?

20:59.826 --> 21:02.360
Everything worked
out just fine.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.962
As for Cozy Glow,
I can assure you.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.466
Where she's going, she won't
be causing any more trouble.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.109
Of course it's
boring here now,

21:18.211 --> 21:20.177
but at least you're
not in a cage!

21:28.220 --> 21:31.255
Hey neighbour,
wanna be friends..?
