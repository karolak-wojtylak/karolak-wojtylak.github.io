00:20.200 --> 00:23.360
Welcome to the Grand
Equestria Pony Summit!

00:25.520 --> 00:27.900
You delegates have
traveled far and wide

00:27.923 --> 00:29.340
to represent your cities

00:29.523 --> 00:31.649
as we seek to
celebrate and learn

00:31.664 --> 00:33.184
from all the unique places

00:33.207 --> 00:35.733
that make up our wonderful
land of Equestria.

00:36.327 --> 00:39.173
At tonight's welcome
reception, Princess Cadance

00:39.192 --> 00:41.733
will dedicate this beautiful
friendship statue,

00:41.942 --> 00:44.708
made up of gemstones from
each of your home cities.

00:52.236 --> 00:53.786
Now I'd like to
turn things over

00:53.809 --> 00:55.790
to the one who
organized the Summit,

00:56.034 --> 00:57.820
Princess
Twilight Sparkle!

00:59.740 --> 01:01.379
Thank you, everypony.

01:01.584 --> 01:03.622
With delegates from
over fifty cities

01:03.691 --> 01:06.392
attending three days of
conferences, receptions,

01:06.419 --> 01:07.356
and meetings,

01:07.622 --> 01:10.678
this is the largest Grand
Equestria Pony Summit yet.

01:11.131 --> 01:13.215
And let me tell you,
putting it all together

01:13.238 --> 01:15.630
has led to more than one
sleepless night.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.192
We're so excited to have you
here and to learn more

01:19.211 --> 01:21.775
about life all across this
great land of ours!

01:25.740 --> 01:27.459
And now, my faithful
assistant Spike

01:27.474 --> 01:29.062
would like to say
a few words.

01:30.803 --> 01:33.043
Um, hello, everypony.

01:33.150 --> 01:35.596
I'm here to help any way I can,

01:35.748 --> 01:38.011
so if there's anything I
can do for any of you--

01:38.041 --> 01:40.060
We love you,
Princess Twilight!

01:40.163 --> 01:41.908
We love all the princesses!

01:45.116 --> 01:47.615
I guess everypony
loves a princess.

01:55.616 --> 02:00.610
Regular subtitles by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

02:34.537 --> 02:35.142
Agh!

02:35.211 --> 02:35.984
Spike!

02:37.878 --> 02:38.506
Spike?

02:38.841 --> 02:40.220
Little help?

02:42.525 --> 02:44.114
Spike, we need you!

02:44.365 --> 02:46.064
Of course! What
can I do?

02:48.011 --> 02:49.965
Spike: Whoa! What
happened to you?

02:50.289 --> 02:53.226
Oh, I'm sorry, Spike, I just

02:55.752 --> 02:58.826
need a quick nap...napkin.

02:59.169 --> 03:00.914
Tell the delegates I'll...

03:01.817 --> 03:05.257
She's been awake three straight
days preparing for the Summit.

03:05.321 --> 03:07.737
We need to make sure she
gets some rest today.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.156
She'll never be able to
attend the welcome reception

03:10.186 --> 03:11.394
in this condition.

03:11.942 --> 03:15.470
Can I count on you to see to
it that she isn't disturbed?

03:17.413 --> 03:19.436
I promise I won't let you down.

03:37.664 --> 03:38.678
Perfect.

03:43.577 --> 03:45.306
Not on my watch.

03:47.843 --> 03:49.260
Uh, excuse me?

03:49.699 --> 03:51.070
Can you keep it
down a little?

03:53.333 --> 03:54.041
Oh no!

03:58.807 --> 04:00.571
I'll give you
birdseed...worms...

04:00.777 --> 04:01.310
anything!

04:01.424 --> 04:03.600
Just please stop singing
before you wake the Princess!

04:09.760 --> 04:11.672
Huh. I can't believe
that worked.

04:26.491 --> 04:27.169
Ah!

04:29.600 --> 04:32.918
Uh, hi fellas. Sorry
to break up your game,

04:32.933 --> 04:34.540
but there's sort
of an important

04:34.567 --> 04:36.571
diplomatic summit
kinda thingy going on

04:36.590 --> 04:39.672
and it involves a princess
needing to sleep and uh,...

04:40.476 --> 04:42.773
maybe you could move
your game somewhere else?

04:48.224 --> 04:50.323
The Princess thanks you
for your understanding!

04:51.390 --> 04:52.144
Excuse me!

04:52.358 --> 04:53.744
Do you have to do
this right now?

04:54.620 --> 04:56.099
HA-CHEW!

04:56.499 --> 04:57.363
Oh no!

04:57.649 --> 04:59.531
Are those Dragonsneeze Trees?

05:02.331 --> 05:04.160
These are too top heavy.

05:04.198 --> 05:06.194
Wouldn't take much to
bring these beauties down.

05:07.935 --> 05:09.946
Can't you just wait a few hours?

05:10.083 --> 05:11.718
Sorry, it's a public hazard.

05:11.786 --> 05:12.636
I've got my orders.

05:12.860 --> 05:14.937
Well, I've got my
orders, too...

05:15.226 --> 05:18.377
from Princess Twi-Twi-Twilight.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.453
HA-CHEW!

05:20.651 --> 05:22.022
Princess Twilight?

05:22.243 --> 05:24.312
Oh! Why didn't you say so!

05:24.521 --> 05:26.529
Gee, I reckon they'll
keep a few more hours.

05:28.262 --> 05:30.213
Good thing I've got the
princesses on my side.

05:35.321 --> 05:36.502
Aw, come on!

05:37.040 --> 05:38.358
EXCUSE ME!

05:38.575 --> 05:40.240
EXCUSE ME! SIR!

05:40.472 --> 05:41.676
I REALLY NEED YOU TO--

05:41.927 --> 05:43.344
--STOP RIGHT NOW!

05:44.125 --> 05:44.681
Oops.

05:44.769 --> 05:46.495
Let me guess, the noise?

05:46.982 --> 05:49.493
Sorry, but we can't have
a broken water main.

05:49.706 --> 05:51.718
What, you couldn't
do this yesterday?

05:52.003 --> 05:54.339
Hey, pal, I'm just tryin'
to make sure everything

05:54.358 --> 05:55.878
runs smooth for the Summit.

05:56.129 --> 05:58.502
But there is no Summit
without Princess Twilight!

05:58.723 --> 06:01.493
And she needs things to
be kept quiet around here.

06:01.775 --> 06:02.925
So if you don't mind, I'd--

06:02.944 --> 06:05.512
All right, all right, if that's
how she wants it.

06:06.594 --> 06:08.095
But if something happens,
it ain't my fault.

06:19.104 --> 06:21.440
Hm. Princess Twilight
will be rested;

06:21.699 --> 06:23.280
Princess Cadance will be proud

06:23.436 --> 06:26.579
and Princess Spike
deserves a little reward.

06:27.607 --> 06:29.470
Princess Spike. Heh-heh!

06:33.150 --> 06:35.634
All right, I worked
forever on this thing.

06:36.819 --> 06:38.929
Uh, hi, can I help you?

06:39.211 --> 06:41.100
My friend here, the
distinguished pony

06:41.146 --> 06:44.171
from up Manehattan and I are
in a bit of a pickle,

06:44.373 --> 06:47.055
and we need the Princess
Twilight to resolve it.

06:47.714 --> 06:50.845
Can you talk a little quieter?
And maybe come back later?

06:50.998 --> 06:52.533
Oh, sure now, gosh,
I wish we could,

06:52.575 --> 06:54.697
but uh, we're both
supposed to give speeches

06:54.716 --> 06:57.081
about our local economies
in five minutes.

06:57.306 --> 06:59.299
And we've been booked
in the same hall.

06:59.459 --> 07:01.440
I had the room first,
and let's be honest,

07:01.497 --> 07:03.215
my speech is more important.

07:03.443 --> 07:05.912
Point of order there, sir,
but I think you'll find

07:05.935 --> 07:09.158
that my speech is the more
important one, dontcha know.

07:09.375 --> 07:12.179
Look, youse is gonna have
a lot of unhappy delegates

07:12.190 --> 07:14.224
on your hooves unless
we get a ruling

07:14.243 --> 07:16.121
from Princess
Twilight right now.

07:21.424 --> 07:24.049
Let me see what I can do.

07:35.771 --> 07:38.491
Huh? Does something
need scheduling?

07:38.803 --> 07:40.198
Oh, uh, yeah.

07:40.514 --> 07:42.518
Two delegates have speeches
booked in the same hall.

07:42.921 --> 07:43.748
What do I do?

07:44.019 --> 07:45.097
OK, no problem.

07:45.150 --> 07:47.908
Just put the hay in the
apple and eat the candle.

07:48.925 --> 07:49.443
Huh?

07:52.967 --> 07:53.946
I need an answer!

07:54.114 --> 07:55.672
But Twilight can't
even think straight.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.510
Oh my gosh! What am
I supposed to do?

08:03.801 --> 08:04.986
Well? What did she say?

08:05.337 --> 08:06.502
She picked me, right?

08:06.636 --> 08:07.554
Hey hey hey!

08:07.699 --> 08:10.049
Let's not be too
hasty there, good sir.

08:10.255 --> 08:12.148
I got a feeling
she went with me.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.152
Hey, hey if she
didn't pick me,

08:14.259 --> 08:17.577
it ain't hard to see that as an
insult to all of Manehattan.

08:17.786 --> 08:18.674
You know what I'm sayin'?

08:18.849 --> 08:20.971
And it'd sure be a
shame to see something

08:20.990 --> 08:23.360
like a scheduling issue
create a nasty old rift

08:23.386 --> 08:25.417
between Whinnyapolis
and Ponyville.

08:25.718 --> 08:28.201
So? What did the
Princess say?

08:28.411 --> 08:30.232
Come on now,
spit it out!

08:30.544 --> 08:34.156
Ummm, she said that,
well, she said, that she,

08:34.765 --> 08:36.822
she wants you to ... share it?

08:39.702 --> 08:42.617
If that's what the Princess
wants, what are you gonna do?

08:42.708 --> 08:44.293
The Princess is always right.

08:44.575 --> 08:47.535
No hard feelings; this
is not about you and me.

08:50.316 --> 08:52.609
And now back to more
important things.

08:58.102 --> 09:00.609
Combining those two
talks was a disaster!

09:00.780 --> 09:02.041
The hall was overcrowded

09:02.068 --> 09:04.049
and the speakers just
shouted over each other!

09:04.110 --> 09:05.139
Huh? But--

09:05.150 --> 09:07.504
Why would the Princess
have made such a decision?

09:10.636 --> 09:11.310
Uh-oh.

09:15.120 --> 09:19.512
Uh, by order of Princess
Twilight...be quiet!

09:23.958 --> 09:25.371
I was really looking forward

09:25.394 --> 09:27.634
to the "Don't Spend
All Your Bits" speech,

09:27.889 --> 09:31.638
but when I went into the
hall, a pony had taken my seat.

09:32.133 --> 09:35.081
A pony who used to be my friend!

09:35.493 --> 09:38.285
Your friend took
your seat? Big deal.

09:38.594 --> 09:39.104
Why don't you just--

09:39.127 --> 09:42.483
No offense, but I don't need
some random dragon's opinion.

09:42.529 --> 09:45.310
I want to hear what
Princess Twilight thinks.

09:45.714 --> 09:47.249
Ugh. Fine.

09:54.057 --> 09:57.188
Uh, the Princess says no
friendship should end

09:57.200 --> 09:58.007
over a seat.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.615
You should forgive your friend.

10:00.369 --> 10:04.544
Of course! Oh, the
Princess is so wise!

10:06.415 --> 10:08.320
I could tell these
delegates anything

10:08.537 --> 10:10.354
as long as they think it
came from Twilight.

10:12.899 --> 10:14.419
All right, who's next?

10:54.975 --> 10:58.819
So how can Princess
Twilight be of service?

10:59.120 --> 11:02.396
Well! As host city, the
Canterlot delegation

11:02.556 --> 11:05.276
feels it's only right
that we should get passes

11:05.318 --> 11:07.440
to every meeting
and party, yes?

11:07.870 --> 11:09.207
Well, that's doesn't seem fair.

11:09.249 --> 11:12.811
I mean, Princess Twilight
doesn't think that seems fair.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.718
Yes, yes, very well.

11:16.087 --> 11:18.495
It was worth a try,
though, wasn't it old chap?

11:21.249 --> 11:22.579
This is great!

11:22.807 --> 11:24.361
I just took care of a
whole bunch of stuff

11:24.380 --> 11:26.457
that Twilight won't have to
worry about when she wakes up!

11:26.864 --> 11:29.344
Wonder if anypony else
needs the Princess's help.

11:36.015 --> 11:37.645
If I can check a few
of these meetings

11:37.664 --> 11:39.009
off Twilight's schedule,

11:39.245 --> 11:40.194
then when she wakes up,

11:40.339 --> 11:42.594
she won't have to think about
anything but the reception.

11:48.038 --> 11:51.001
Uh, says here you have a
meeting with Princess Twilight?

11:52.979 --> 11:55.573
Yuppers. She wanted
me to prep her on all the

11:55.596 --> 11:58.628
different gemstones in the
Citizens of Equestria statue

11:58.647 --> 12:00.411
before the reception tonight.

12:00.716 --> 12:01.805
OK. Go ahead.

12:02.632 --> 12:07.337
Um, well, I'd rather um,
tell the Princess directly.

12:07.558 --> 12:10.796
Well, if it helps, you can
call me Princess Spike.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.078
No no no! It's all right!

12:15.230 --> 12:17.420
The Princess asked me to take
care of a few things for her.

12:17.702 --> 12:18.765
That's why I came to find you.

12:20.601 --> 12:21.664
If you say so.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.436
The Princess says so.

12:25.085 --> 12:27.805
OK, let's start with topaze.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.030
I'm here for your 2:00.

12:32.190 --> 12:32.796
You?

12:33.192 --> 12:35.520
But I'm supposed to be
briefing Princess Twilight

12:35.542 --> 12:37.100
on the progress with
the water main.

12:37.459 --> 12:38.982
I speak for the Princess.

12:39.310 --> 12:41.680
Well, uh, can I start
fixing it again?

12:41.702 --> 12:43.641
I'm gettin' a little
worried, to be honest.

12:44.213 --> 12:47.333
Actually, Twilight still needs
her rest and her "no noise"

12:47.371 --> 12:50.400
policy is still in effect
for a few more hours. Sorry!

12:53.219 --> 12:55.211
Hey Spike, what's going on?

12:55.516 --> 12:58.415
Oh, you know, just settin'
em up and knockin' em down.

12:58.849 --> 12:59.756
What do you mean?

13:00.011 --> 13:03.188
Not only have I kept things
quiet so Twilight could sleep,

13:03.367 --> 13:05.226
I also took care of all her
afternoon meetings

13:05.329 --> 13:07.969
so she won't have to worry
about them when she wakes up.

13:08.575 --> 13:10.963
Are you sure she'd
want you doing that?

13:11.192 --> 13:13.737
There are so many things to
keep track of at this Summit.

13:13.939 --> 13:16.148
Ah, don't worry,
I got it covered.

13:16.384 --> 13:19.687
I know Twilight so well, it's
easy to make decisions like her.

13:20.129 --> 13:21.687
Oh. OK.

13:22.133 --> 13:25.340
Well, thank you for keeping
Twilight's stress level down...

13:25.950 --> 13:28.975
...as long as that's the
real reason you're doing it.

13:29.424 --> 13:31.550
Well, why else
would I be doing it?

13:32.160 --> 13:35.032
You're not enjoying speaking
for Twilight a little bit?

13:35.840 --> 13:38.308
Enjoying it? Ha ha! No way!

13:38.480 --> 13:40.651
The only things I'm doing
by order of the Princess

13:40.674 --> 13:41.969
are for the good of the Summit.

13:48.666 --> 13:50.003
Heh heh heh heh.

13:52.396 --> 13:55.059
By order of the Princess.

13:59.878 --> 14:01.516
By order of the Princess.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.954
By order of the Princess.

14:12.297 --> 14:15.455
Ah. Princess life is good.

14:18.030 --> 14:22.201
It sure is. But it's also
hard work, isn't it?

14:22.369 --> 14:23.710
Eh, it's not so bad.

14:23.973 --> 14:27.466
Spike, I'm concerned you might
be abusing your relationship

14:27.489 --> 14:28.346
with Twilight.

14:29.093 --> 14:31.154
What are you talking about?
I'm a great princess!

14:32.171 --> 14:33.912
I mean, Twilight's
a great princess

14:33.996 --> 14:35.546
and I've been working
hard to help her!

14:35.855 --> 14:37.527
When two delegates
had a falling out,

14:37.676 --> 14:39.020
I'm the one who fixed
their friendship!

14:39.276 --> 14:41.097
I listened to that pony
drone on about gems

14:41.116 --> 14:43.268
for forty-five minutes so
Twilight wouldn't have to!

14:43.527 --> 14:45.980
I moved a polo match away from
the tower so she could sleep!

14:46.224 --> 14:48.643
And I didn't even eat that
delicious looking statue!

14:48.918 --> 14:50.731
I'm a decision-making master!

14:53.744 --> 14:58.083
OK, so maybe I did get a little
carried away making decisions.

14:58.285 --> 15:00.217
But it's not like
anything bad happened.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.378
Whooooaa!

15:21.935 --> 15:23.775
This is unexpected.

15:24.045 --> 15:26.929
I'll go shut off the main;
you get rid of the water!

16:00.598 --> 16:02.902
At least the statue's OK.

16:06.628 --> 16:07.360
Oh no.

16:07.996 --> 16:08.868
Oh no!

16:09.120 --> 16:11.794
Ah...Ah...HACHEW!

16:17.908 --> 16:19.493
Aw, bless me.

16:24.182 --> 16:25.352
Oh my!

16:28.780 --> 16:30.281
What is the meaning of this?

16:30.735 --> 16:34.735
Well, uh, ya see, there
was this polo game and--

16:34.807 --> 16:36.857
How could you let
a water main burst

16:36.872 --> 16:38.876
on Canterlot's most
important day?

16:39.051 --> 16:40.156
Hey, don't look at me.

16:40.373 --> 16:42.986
Princess Twilight said
to stop working on it.

16:43.272 --> 16:44.819
Well, what about these trees?

16:44.876 --> 16:47.801
I ordered them trimmed to
avoid just such a situation!

16:47.889 --> 16:49.897
Well, the princess
told me to stop, bub.

16:50.247 --> 16:52.948
Why would the Princess make
such horrible decisions?

16:53.142 --> 16:54.742
This all could have
been prevented!

16:55.710 --> 16:57.847
Please! Everypony, listen!

16:58.019 --> 16:59.988
I'm so sorry all this happened!

17:00.072 --> 17:01.577
What are you apologizing for?

17:01.626 --> 17:03.977
These were Princess
Twilight's awful decisions!

17:04.087 --> 17:06.967
I'm about to blow my stack
on Princess Twilight,

17:06.994 --> 17:08.076
I'll tell you that for nothin!

17:08.152 --> 17:09.059
Yeah, me too!

17:09.139 --> 17:12.499
I'll not let Princess Twilight
give Canterlot a bad name

17:12.514 --> 17:13.695
in the eyes of Equestria!

17:13.859 --> 17:17.531
Come on, everypony, let's go
give her a piece of our mind!

17:18.194 --> 17:20.320
Wait, you've got it all wrong!

17:28.933 --> 17:30.011
WAIT!

17:31.455 --> 17:33.756
I mean... wait.

17:34.403 --> 17:35.348
What is it now?

17:35.516 --> 17:37.992
There's an angry mob here
that demands satisfaction!

17:38.506 --> 17:39.428
It's just that, uh,

17:39.710 --> 17:41.363
we don't want to wake
the Princess, do we?

17:41.634 --> 17:42.952
Wake her? What?

17:43.070 --> 17:45.017
You're tellin' me
that she's asleep?

17:53.371 --> 17:56.106
Princess! We must speak at once!

17:56.243 --> 18:00.156
SHE... IS...SLEEPING!

18:10.121 --> 18:13.078
I'm glad you're here, Spike.
We've got a lot to do.

18:13.169 --> 18:14.956
Do you know if the
water main was fixed?

18:15.356 --> 18:17.935
Uh, you seem well rested.

18:18.106 --> 18:20.563
I haven't slept like
that since I was a filly.

18:20.758 --> 18:21.535
You haven't?

18:21.801 --> 18:23.836
Well, at least I
got one thing right.

18:24.579 --> 18:27.268
And it was the one thing
Cadance asked of me.

18:27.462 --> 18:29.241
Maybe I did do a good job today.

18:34.491 --> 18:36.518
Fancy Pants. What's wrong?

18:36.598 --> 18:38.708
Don't play games
with me, Princess.

18:38.780 --> 18:40.114
You know why I'm here!

18:40.232 --> 18:42.586
Is this about the special
privileges you wanted?

18:42.758 --> 18:45.165
Because this seems
a little extreme.

18:45.299 --> 18:47.299
Special privileges?

18:47.398 --> 18:50.224
The last thing on my mind
is special privileges!

18:51.268 --> 18:52.918
What's going on, Spike?

18:53.340 --> 18:56.499
Um...you needed to sleep!

18:56.777 --> 18:58.948
And Princess Cadance told me
you weren't to be disturbed!

18:59.112 --> 19:02.297
And there was this bird,
and well...long story short,

19:02.579 --> 19:05.687
I made a few decisions
on your behalf.

19:08.297 --> 19:10.327
"A few decisions?"

19:10.430 --> 19:12.704
Well, maybe more than a few.

19:12.731 --> 19:15.531
But I had good
intentions. Honest!

19:16.887 --> 19:19.760
Until I didn't anymore.

19:20.388 --> 19:21.687
I'm sorry, Twilight.

19:21.939 --> 19:24.186
I guess I got a
little carried away.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.965
It just felt so good to have
ponies caring about my opinions

19:28.000 --> 19:29.436
on such important matters.

19:29.980 --> 19:33.520
I guess I was just enjoying
feeling like a princess.

19:34.601 --> 19:37.466
Well, Spike, one of the most
important things a princess

19:37.481 --> 19:41.028
can do is realize when she's
made a mistake and fix it.

19:41.234 --> 19:42.445
How do I do that?

19:42.582 --> 19:44.160
You could start with them.

19:46.236 --> 19:50.350
Uh, hi there, everypony.

19:50.895 --> 19:55.055
So I guess I owe you all
a pretty big apology.

19:55.481 --> 19:58.144
It's funny, here we
are at a Summit

19:58.194 --> 20:01.051
that brings together ponies
from all across Equestria

20:01.443 --> 20:03.721
and all I could think
about was myself.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.116
You all came here to celebrate
the things that make

20:07.215 --> 20:09.805
each of our cities so
unique and special.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.815
But instead of getting
into the spirit of things

20:12.830 --> 20:14.068
like all of you...

20:14.422 --> 20:18.323
I used my friend's position
to make myself feel good.

20:32.948 --> 20:35.805
The Canterlot ruby
goes here, old sport.

20:36.704 --> 20:39.112
And ours goes
here, dontcha know.

20:56.118 --> 20:57.645
Does this mean you forgive me?

20:57.820 --> 20:59.180
Sure!

20:59.260 --> 21:02.217
You know the whole idea of the
statue is that when each of us

21:02.247 --> 21:05.969
plays our own small part, it
adds up to somethin' grand.

21:06.422 --> 21:08.838
Quite! Just like
how all our cities

21:08.899 --> 21:11.379
make up the beautiful
land of Equestria.

21:11.725 --> 21:14.948
I hereby dedicate the
Citizens of Equestria statue

21:15.142 --> 21:17.828
to everypony who
plays their part,

21:17.927 --> 21:20.495
no matter how big or
how small.

21:25.641 --> 21:27.173
Aw, come on!

21:27.264 --> 21:31.158
Ah...ah...ahhhh--
