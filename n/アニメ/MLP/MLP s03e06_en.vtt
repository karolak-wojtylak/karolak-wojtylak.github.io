00:25.450 --> 00:27.250
Nice moves, kid.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.990
Nice moves?
Rainbow Dash thinks I've got--

00:33.700 --> 00:35.440
nice moves!

00:39.420 --> 00:44.420

01:14.480 --> 01:17.530
...then, all of a sudden,
I'm airborne!

01:17.680 --> 01:21.950
And Rainbow Dash looks over,
and is like "Nice moves, kid".

01:23.220 --> 01:24.630
She really said that?

01:24.780 --> 01:27.840
I mean, it's like she practically told me
she wanted to take me under her wing,

01:27.990 --> 01:31.890
teach me everything she knows,
and become like my big sister!

01:32.620 --> 01:34.430
I dunno about all that.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.270
It was a really nice
compliment and all, but...

01:37.420 --> 01:38.810
I know, I know.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.730
But all that stuff I said
could happen, right?

01:41.880 --> 01:43.730
- Sure
- Absolutely.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.500
I just need to find a way
to spend some time with her,

01:46.650 --> 01:50.690
y'know, so she can see
more of my awesomeness!

01:50.840 --> 01:53.040
Applejack and I are supposed
to be camping up

01:53.190 --> 01:54.720
at Winsome Falls
this weekend.

01:54.870 --> 01:55.880
Maybe I could get my big sis

01:56.030 --> 01:58.630
to invite Rainbow Dash,
and then you could come too!

01:58.780 --> 02:00.280
- Really?
- Sure!

02:00.430 --> 02:02.030
I wanna go...

02:02.180 --> 02:04.630
Well, duh...
of course you can go!

02:04.780 --> 02:06.790
And I'll get Rarity to come too!

02:06.940 --> 02:08.920
Rarity loves camping!

02:09.070 --> 02:11.080
I despise camping!

02:11.230 --> 02:14.640
All of that... nature.

02:14.790 --> 02:17.280
Applejack's going
with her little sister!

02:17.430 --> 02:19.490
But, y'know,

02:19.640 --> 02:22.380
if you don't wanna
spend time with me...

02:23.280 --> 02:25.490
All right!

02:25.830 --> 02:27.900
Ooh! Of course,
I will need to find an outfit

02:28.050 --> 02:30.120
more appropriate
for 'roughing it'.

02:31.250 --> 02:34.280
See?
Told you she'd wanna go.

02:38.340 --> 02:40.731
- You packed bug spray?
- Yup.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.370
- You got the canteens?
- Yup.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.440
Looks like we're all set then.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.430
Hey!

02:52.530 --> 02:54.980
Gee Rarity,
did you remember to pack?

02:55.130 --> 02:56.880
Well, let's see
who gets the last laugh

02:57.030 --> 02:58.830
when you're absolutely desparate
to curl your lashes,

02:58.980 --> 03:01.510
and you realize you didn't bring
your eyelash curler.

03:01.660 --> 03:04.430
Well, looks like
we're all set now.

03:04.580 --> 03:07.580
But what about Rainbow Dash?
Isn't Rainbow Dash coming?

03:07.730 --> 03:09.230
'Course she is, sugarcube.

03:09.380 --> 03:11.430
She's gonna meet us up
at our first campsite.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.950
Alright, y'all,
let's move 'em out!

03:21.030 --> 03:23.290
Oh, are we there yet?

03:23.440 --> 03:25.580
The last thousand times
you asked that,

03:25.730 --> 03:27.080
the answer was no.

03:27.230 --> 03:28.880
This time, it's actually yes.

03:29.030 --> 03:30.840
There's Rainbow Dash
up there right now.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.280
Alright, Scootaloo,
just play it cool.

03:48.190 --> 03:49.380
Hey, Rai--

03:54.910 --> 03:57.570
Hey, Rainbow Dash!
What's up?

03:58.280 --> 04:00.200
What took you guys so long?

04:00.480 --> 04:03.730
Well, some of us didn't pack
as light as the others.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.650
So we were slowed down a bit.

04:15.870 --> 04:18.010
Looks like you'll be sharing
a tent with me, huh?

04:18.160 --> 04:20.160
If that's okay with you.

04:20.310 --> 04:22.530
Sure! As long as you don't snore.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.330
You don't snore, do you?

04:24.480 --> 04:26.030
Nope. No way. Not me!

04:26.180 --> 04:28.630
Never snored a day
or a night in my life.

04:28.780 --> 04:31.600
Then you and I are
gonna get along just fine.

04:38.130 --> 04:40.430
You've got to be kidding me...

04:40.580 --> 04:41.450
Sweetie Belle,

04:41.600 --> 04:45.410
do be a dear and see if you can find
some fresh flowers for my bedside vase.

04:47.140 --> 04:48.410
Hey, Scootaloo,

04:48.560 --> 04:51.760
do be a sweetheart and see
if you can gather some firewood.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.880
Seriously though.

04:55.030 --> 04:56.630
Can you get us
some wood for the fire?

04:56.780 --> 04:58.260
Of course!

05:02.160 --> 05:04.300
Okay, everybody get comfortable.

05:07.660 --> 05:10.980
'Cause I'm about to tell you
the best story you ever heard.

05:11.130 --> 05:12.880
Is it about the time
when Rarity had wings,

05:13.030 --> 05:14.030
and then they got ruined,

05:14.180 --> 05:16.830
and then you saved her
from plummeting to her doom?

05:16.980 --> 05:20.570
Okay, maybe it's the second
best story you ever heard.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.420
But probably still the scariest.

05:23.570 --> 05:26.830
You like scary stories, right?

05:29.170 --> 05:31.530
It all happened on a night,

05:31.680 --> 05:34.020
just like this one.

05:34.170 --> 05:35.617
In a forest,

05:35.768 --> 05:38.499
just like this.

05:39.050 --> 05:42.420
...and then,
the olden pony asked,

05:42.570 --> 05:46.140
<i>"Who's got my rusty horseshoe?"</i>

05:46.520 --> 05:47.790
Not me!

05:48.770 --> 05:49.830
You do!

05:52.680 --> 05:56.230
Something in my throat.
I wasn't scared at all!

05:56.380 --> 05:57.650
Good story!

05:57.800 --> 05:59.490
Knew you wouldn't be scared.

05:59.640 --> 06:00.990
The way you jumped
that cart the other day...

06:01.140 --> 06:03.530
you were like me, fearless.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.840
Yeah. Fearless.

06:07.030 --> 06:11.200
Don't worry, Rarity is here
to keep you safe and sound.

06:12.780 --> 06:15.230
Think it's about time for me
to hit the straw.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.550
Don't you worry, little sis.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.800
There's no 'olden pony' in our tent.

06:20.950 --> 06:23.740
That sure was funny, wasn't it!

06:23.900 --> 06:27.220
How they were all afraid
of the olden pony...

06:27.370 --> 06:28.900
but not me!

06:29.050 --> 06:32.230
That's because you're tough,
just like I was when I was your age!

06:34.480 --> 06:35.880
I'm hitting the sack.

06:36.030 --> 06:37.630
Come in whenever you feel like it.

06:41.890 --> 06:45.670
It's, it's nothing...
Just my imagination...

06:47.680 --> 06:51.290
And that isn't the thundering
stamp of the olden pony...

07:13.180 --> 07:15.600
I-Is anyone out there?

07:31.830 --> 07:35.460
Who's got my rusty horseshoe?

07:48.180 --> 07:51.750
Who's got my rusty horseshoe?

08:00.460 --> 08:01.940
Rainbow Da--?

08:02.090 --> 08:03.360
You do!

08:24.370 --> 08:26.730
What's that noise?

08:26.880 --> 08:28.670
Is there a bug in here?

08:28.970 --> 08:32.430
I dunno about you,
but I slept like a filly.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.900
Best night ever!

08:34.050 --> 08:36.860
Glad you're rested up, because
we've got a long trek ahead.

08:37.010 --> 08:40.060
Totally gonna be worth it
when we get to Winsome Falls.

08:40.210 --> 08:43.670
Yeah... Totally...

08:47.320 --> 08:50.500
Am I sweating?
I think I'm sweating!

08:53.090 --> 08:57.670
But it's absolutely worth it to get
to spend time with my little sister.

08:57.820 --> 09:01.170
It just feels like this cart
is getting heavier all the time!

09:01.320 --> 09:04.420
I don't care if that cart
is heavy as a pack of mules.

09:04.570 --> 09:07.560
If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark
before we get to the campsite!

09:07.710 --> 09:08.810
Dark?!

09:09.770 --> 09:12.860
I'll just ride ahead
to make sure the path is clear.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.820
Now we don't wanna be
out here after dark, right?

09:15.970 --> 09:17.260
Doesn't matter to me.

09:17.410 --> 09:19.310
Well, y'know...

09:19.460 --> 09:21.610
it's for the scaredy-ponies.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.020
Don't fall asleep now...

09:36.170 --> 09:39.370
I've got to get to
that campsite before dark...

10:09.670 --> 10:10.780
Don't come this way!

10:10.930 --> 10:12.970
Take the path!
It's... aheh...

10:13.120 --> 10:15.900
way better than going
through the bushes.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.480
You're more nervous
than a worm in an apple

10:27.630 --> 10:28.870
on cider making day.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.340
What gives, Scootaloo?

10:30.500 --> 10:33.020
Nothing!
Just thought I heard something.

10:35.850 --> 10:38.580
You sure you're okay?
'Cause you seem a little jumpy.

10:38.730 --> 10:40.180
Just getting my exercise!

10:40.330 --> 10:42.720
You know how important it is
to stretch out those hindquarters

10:42.870 --> 10:44.600
every so often!

10:46.950 --> 10:49.610
Uh, do you need a little help?

10:49.770 --> 10:53.160
That's so sweet, thank you.

10:53.310 --> 10:54.920
What are friends for?

10:59.570 --> 11:01.300
No need for tents tonight, y'all.

11:01.450 --> 11:03.490
We'll just take shelter in that cave.

11:04.910 --> 11:08.460
All right!
A deep, dark cave!

11:08.610 --> 11:10.830
Perfect for the story
I've got for tonight.

11:10.980 --> 11:13.920
All we need is a campfire,
and we're good to go.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.310
Uh, of course...

11:18.460 --> 11:21.570
I'll be right back with loads
of firewood from the deep,

11:21.720 --> 11:25.220
dark, not-scary-at-all forest!

11:25.370 --> 11:26.370
Thanks!

11:36.670 --> 11:38.880
Okay. I can do this.

11:39.030 --> 11:42.280
On the count of three,
I get those branches.

11:42.750 --> 11:46.250
One... two... three!

11:52.780 --> 11:56.210
Here, branches branches branches...

11:59.180 --> 12:01.220
It's colder than
a timberwolf's toenail.

12:02.030 --> 12:03.550
Where's that Scootaloo?

12:15.080 --> 12:16.440
Here you go!

12:16.590 --> 12:17.820
That's it?

12:17.970 --> 12:19.820
It's all I could find,
'cause, y'know...

12:19.970 --> 12:22.070
there aren't that
many trees around here!

12:25.080 --> 12:26.120
It's all we need.

12:26.270 --> 12:27.830
Why don't you sit with
Rainbow Dash for a while?

12:32.540 --> 12:35.480
Now, where was I?
Oh yeah!

12:35.630 --> 12:38.590
The scary part...

12:41.880 --> 12:43.710
Hey, I have an idea!

12:43.860 --> 12:45.820
How about I tell tonight's story?

12:46.350 --> 12:49.310
Alright, just make sure
it's a horrible one.

12:49.460 --> 12:52.560
There once was
a really really nice pony

12:52.710 --> 12:54.980
who lived in a bright
and sunny land,

12:55.130 --> 12:56.980
where there are
rainbows every day,

12:57.130 --> 12:59.960
and lots and lots
of happy friends, and--

13:00.110 --> 13:01.070
No offense, but,

13:01.220 --> 13:03.870
it's not a real campfire story
unless somepony's shaking.

13:04.660 --> 13:09.290
I've been told that
these very woods are haunted...

13:10.210 --> 13:12.920
by the headless horse!

13:13.710 --> 13:16.380
It gallops only at night.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.640
If he doesn't have a head,

13:17.790 --> 13:20.020
then how in tarnation does
this pony know where it's goin'?

13:20.170 --> 13:22.440
It's headless, not brainless.

13:23.290 --> 13:27.320
...looking for little lost ponies.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.200
So where is its brain?

13:30.520 --> 13:33.350
Fear was dripping from the air...

13:33.500 --> 13:38.080
...and they were never heard from
ever again!

13:38.930 --> 13:39.880
Never?

13:40.790 --> 13:41.880
Never.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.330
Don't worry, you'll be safe
with me tonight.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.830
- It's not time for bed yet, is it?
- 'Fraid so, Scootaloo.

13:55.980 --> 13:59.460
Uh, but we haven't sung
any campfire songs yet!

13:59.610 --> 14:01.590
You don't have to ask me twice!

14:03.000 --> 14:05.220
Ninety-nine buckets of oats
on the wall,

14:05.370 --> 14:07.260
ninety-nine buckets of oats!

14:07.410 --> 14:08.770
Take one down,
pass it around,

14:08.920 --> 14:11.270
you got eighty-one
buckets of oats on the wall!

14:11.420 --> 14:13.350
Forty-one buckets of oats!

14:13.500 --> 14:15.230
Take one down,
pass it around,

14:15.380 --> 14:18.320
you got forty...
buckets of oats on the wall!

14:19.790 --> 14:21.470
Take one down,
pass it around,

14:21.620 --> 14:25.973
you've got zero buckets of oats
on the waaaallll!!

14:32.250 --> 14:33.970
- Good night, y'all.
- Good night, y'all.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.370
Sleep tight.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.330
Oh, just one more song!

14:37.570 --> 14:39.000
Anyone?

14:39.220 --> 14:40.750
How about a dance contest?

14:40.910 --> 14:42.970
I know you love to cut a rug,

14:43.120 --> 14:44.770
so how 'bout
we mess up a cave floor?

14:45.370 --> 14:46.720
I have a brilliant idea!

14:46.870 --> 14:48.400
Hide and seek, who's with me?

14:50.390 --> 14:51.970
Maybe tomorrow.

14:54.710 --> 14:57.070
Seems like you don't really
wanna go to sleep tonight.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.650
Is there some reason why?

14:58.800 --> 15:01.540
Pfft, of course not!

15:01.700 --> 15:05.090
I just love camping and hanging out
with Rainbow Dash so much

15:05.240 --> 15:09.060
that I don't wanna waste
a single minute with sleep!

15:11.440 --> 15:13.080
Silly sleep.

15:13.230 --> 15:15.130
That's cool and all, Scoot.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.510
But this pony needs her shut-eye
and she needs it now!

15:20.520 --> 15:22.400
This is so unfair...

15:25.420 --> 15:28.420
I'm falling asleep...

15:53.120 --> 15:55.420
If the headless horse catches me,

15:55.570 --> 15:57.600
I'm never gonna be heard from again!

15:57.750 --> 16:00.210
And I wanna be heard from!

16:13.010 --> 16:16.140
It's all over!

16:22.240 --> 16:24.930
A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.450
Princess Luna!

16:33.600 --> 16:35.480
I thought you were
the headless horse!

16:35.630 --> 16:39.160
You were mistaken,
but I hope not disappointed.

16:39.310 --> 16:42.380
You are so, so much better
than the headless horse!

16:42.530 --> 16:45.170
But what are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in Canterlot?

16:45.320 --> 16:47.440
I am the princess of the night.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.160
Thus it is my duty
to come into your dreams.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.370
Oh yeah... wait.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.010
This is just a dream?

16:54.160 --> 16:55.820
But it feels so real!

16:57.040 --> 17:00.030
I assure you that you are asleep.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.610
But when you awake,

17:01.760 --> 17:05.090
the thing that frightens you most
will still exist.

17:06.410 --> 17:08.100
The headless horse?

17:08.920 --> 17:12.740
Is the headless horse really
what frightens you the most?

17:14.730 --> 17:18.010
I'm afraid Rainbow Dash
will find out I'm not as tough

17:18.160 --> 17:19.820
as she thinks I am.

17:19.980 --> 17:22.250
Everypony has fears, Scootaloo.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.620
Everypony must face them
in their own way.

17:25.770 --> 17:29.450
But they must be faced,
or the nightmares will continue.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.540
Face your fears!

17:40.770 --> 17:42.560
Princess Luna?!

17:44.310 --> 17:46.050
It was just a dream.

17:48.660 --> 17:50.760
But the headless horse isn't!

17:51.660 --> 17:55.440
Rainbow Dash said it lives here,
in these very woods!

18:00.150 --> 18:02.650
It's the wicked whinny
of the headless horse!

18:11.280 --> 18:13.420
So, it's a horse without a head...

18:13.570 --> 18:15.580
which means
it doesn't have a mouth...

18:15.730 --> 18:17.920
and if it doesn't have a mouth,
then...

18:18.070 --> 18:20.250
it's not a horsey pony
but a horse...

18:20.400 --> 18:22.110
but still...

18:22.260 --> 18:24.840
it's a horse... without a head!

18:34.640 --> 18:38.210
Hello?!
Is anyone out there?

18:38.960 --> 18:41.840
Anyone except the headless horse?

18:45.250 --> 18:46.830
Heellllp!

18:58.920 --> 18:59.880
I gotcha!

19:00.030 --> 19:03.960
Rainbow Dash! Is that you?
Thank you, thank you!

19:06.090 --> 19:08.810
What were you doing out here
in the middle of the night?!

19:15.350 --> 19:19.350
It is time for you to face
your real fear, Scootaloo!

19:26.870 --> 19:28.840
I'm so, so sorry,
Rainbow Dash,

19:28.990 --> 19:31.490
I just wanted you to hang out
with me and see how cool I was

19:31.640 --> 19:34.120
so you'd take me under your wing
and teach me everything you know

19:34.270 --> 19:36.330
and become like my big sister!

19:36.480 --> 19:39.750
But then you started telling
those spooky stories and I got scared!

19:39.900 --> 19:43.860
I thought I heard the headless horse
so I ran out here by myself, and...

19:44.010 --> 19:47.680
Well, I guess you know the rest.

19:49.820 --> 19:54.100
Hey, I'm gonna tell you something,
but if you ever tell anypony else,

19:54.250 --> 19:55.540
I'm gonna deny it.

19:55.690 --> 19:58.340
First time I heard those stories...

19:58.490 --> 20:00.150
I was scared too.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.230
- You were?
- Sure!

20:04.380 --> 20:06.540
I mean, I got over it
because I realized pretty quick

20:06.690 --> 20:08.820
that if there was such thing
as a headless horse,

20:08.980 --> 20:10.700
I could totally take it on!

20:11.460 --> 20:15.040
So, you're looking for somepony
to take you under their wing, huh?

20:16.170 --> 20:18.290
Yeah, I might be up
for something like that.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.580
Really?

20:19.730 --> 20:20.900
As long as you don't go falling

20:21.050 --> 20:23.490
into any more rivers
in the middle of the night.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.020
It's a deal.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.140
I call sister teams!

20:35.290 --> 20:37.810
Last pair to make it to the falls
is a mouldy carrot!

20:37.960 --> 20:40.540
Ugh, if you insist.

20:42.940 --> 20:44.820
It is so on!

20:46.940 --> 20:49.820
They think they can beat
the two of us?

21:08.180 --> 21:12.470
Who's got my rusty horseshoe?

21:14.470 --> 21:16.220
Here it is, for pony's sake.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.750
Now take it and stop
all your moaning.

21:18.900 --> 21:21.360
Thank you, and have a nice day.
