WEBVTT

00:02.179 --> 00:04.265
Wow, what a gorgeous day!

00:04.529 --> 00:07.954
Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early
for once and cleared all the clouds away.

00:08.569 --> 00:11.756
I bet all of Ponyville is gonna be out,
enjoying the sunshine.

00:12.970 --> 00:15.137
What? Where is everypony?

00:21.709 --> 00:23.536
Is it some sort of pony holiday?

00:23.913 --> 00:24.981
Not that I know of.

00:25.653 --> 00:27.010
Does my breath stink?

00:29.238 --> 00:30.685
Not more than usual.

00:31.126 --> 00:31.761
Is it...

00:32.071 --> 00:33.061
...zombies?!

00:33.132 --> 00:34.943
Uh... not very likely.

00:35.105 --> 00:37.809
Not likely but possible?

00:38.183 --> 00:39.087
Psst!

00:41.522 --> 00:42.511
Twilight!

00:43.804 --> 00:44.670
Spike!

00:44.671 --> 00:45.833
Come 'ere!

00:46.668 --> 00:48.073
Come here!

00:48.324 --> 00:49.784
Hurry!

00:49.884 --> 00:51.552
Before she gets you!

00:54.891 --> 00:56.617
Who?! The zombie pony?

00:56.896 --> 00:58.980
Zzzombie pony?!

01:00.540 --> 01:02.704
Spike, there are no zombie ponies.

01:03.024 --> 01:05.636
Pinkie, what are you doing
here alone in the dark?

01:05.637 --> 01:07.201
I'm not alone in the dark.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.241
Okay then, what are you all
doing here in the dark?

01:11.436 --> 01:13.552
We're h-hidin' from her!

02:03.512 --> 02:04.973
Did you see her, Twilight?

02:04.974 --> 02:06.783
Did you see Zecora?

02:06.784 --> 02:09.285
Apple Bloom! I told you never to say that name.

02:09.620 --> 02:11.676
Well, I saw here glance this way...

02:11.677 --> 02:14.449
Glance eeevilly this way!

02:14.788 --> 02:17.261
...and then a bunch of you
flip out for no good reason.

02:17.551 --> 02:19.051
No good reason?!

02:19.052 --> 02:21.582
You call protectin' your kin no good reason?

02:21.782 --> 02:24.941
Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town...

02:24.942 --> 02:27.554
...she started shakin' in her lil' horse shoes.

02:27.555 --> 02:29.242
Diiid nooot.

02:29.342 --> 02:31.155
So I swept her up and brought her here.

02:31.537 --> 02:33.305
I walked here myself!

02:33.306 --> 02:34.593
For safekeepin'.

02:34.693 --> 02:36.780
Applejack! I'm not a baby!

02:36.781 --> 02:38.605
I can take care of myself.

02:38.919 --> 02:40.923
Not from that creepy Zecora.

02:41.142 --> 02:43.045
She's mysterious...

02:43.046 --> 02:44.263
Sinister...

02:44.264 --> 02:46.988
And spoooky!

02:55.505 --> 02:57.401
Will you cut that out?

02:57.809 --> 03:00.621
Just look at those stripes. So garish.

03:01.163 --> 03:02.420
She's a zebra.

03:02.789 --> 03:04.079
A WHAT?!

03:04.179 --> 03:07.850
A zebra. And her stripes aren't
a fashion choice, Rarity.

03:07.851 --> 03:09.669
They're what she was born with.

03:11.616 --> 03:15.250
Born where? I've never seen
a pony like that in these parts.

03:15.251 --> 03:16.838
'cept her.

03:17.165 --> 03:18.998
Well, she's probably not from here.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.227
And she's not a pony.

03:20.228 --> 03:23.270
My books say that zebras come from a faraway land.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.270
But I've never seen her in Ponyville.

03:25.578 --> 03:26.715
Where does she live?

03:27.233 --> 03:28.697
That's just it.

03:28.897 --> 03:29.965
She lives in...

03:30.214 --> 03:32.354
...the Everfree Forest!

03:33.910 --> 03:34.830
Spike!

03:35.440 --> 03:36.789
Uh... sorry.

03:37.197 --> 03:39.721
The Everfree Forest just ain't natural.

03:39.921 --> 03:41.315
The plants grow...

03:41.316 --> 03:43.635
Animals care for themselves...

03:43.636 --> 03:45.498
And the clouds move...

03:45.598 --> 03:47.847
...ALL ON THEIR OWN!

03:49.854 --> 03:52.657
And that wicked enchantress Zecora
lives there, doing her evil...

03:53.044 --> 03:53.588
...stuff!

03:53.589 --> 03:55.965
Oh, she's so evil I even wrote a song about her!

03:55.966 --> 03:57.333
Here we go...

03:57.334 --> 04:00.162
<i>She's an evil enchantress!
She does evil dances!</i>

04:00.163 --> 04:03.114
<i>And if you look deep in her eyes
She puts you in trances!</i>

04:03.115 --> 04:05.613
<i>Then what will she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew!</i>

04:05.614 --> 04:08.170
<i>Then she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew!</i>

04:08.171 --> 04:09.763
<i>So... WATCH OUT!</i>

04:12.670 --> 04:13.999
Wow. Catchy.

04:14.256 --> 04:15.622
It's a work in progress.

04:15.917 --> 04:18.145
This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors.

04:18.204 --> 04:21.756
Now tell me, what exactly have you
actually seen Zecora do?

04:22.002 --> 04:23.337
Well...

04:23.824 --> 04:27.569
Once a month she comes into Ponyville...

04:27.677 --> 04:28.648
Ooh!

04:28.649 --> 04:31.618
Then she lurks by the stores...

04:31.619 --> 04:33.216
Oh my!

04:33.217 --> 04:36.595
And then she digs at the ground...

04:36.801 --> 04:38.670
Good gracious!

04:38.945 --> 04:40.224
Okay, I'm sorry.

04:40.225 --> 04:42.067
But how is any of this bad?

04:42.068 --> 04:44.274
Maybe she comes to town to visit?

04:44.608 --> 04:47.117
Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' to be neighborly?

04:47.118 --> 04:51.091
And maybe she's not lurking by the stores,
maybe she's going to them...

04:51.092 --> 04:53.327
...lurk-free, to so some shopping.

04:53.570 --> 04:55.786
Yeah! Everypony likes to shop.

04:55.787 --> 04:56.750
You know what I think...?

04:56.751 --> 04:59.373
Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk!

04:59.374 --> 05:01.432
I am a big pony!

05:01.764 --> 05:04.054
W-what about digging at the ground?

05:04.055 --> 05:06.467
You gotta admit that's weird.

05:06.861 --> 05:09.788
What if she's digging for innocent creatures?

05:09.789 --> 05:12.960
I am sure there's an explanation
for everything Zecora does.

05:12.961 --> 05:16.595
And if anypony here were actually
brave enough to approach her...

05:16.596 --> 05:18.255
...she would find out the truth.

05:18.513 --> 05:21.909
Well, I'm brave enough.
I'm gonna find out myself.

05:43.130 --> 05:45.289
You ponies are being ridiculous!

05:45.357 --> 05:47.571
Well, I heard that Zecora...

05:47.572 --> 05:49.094
...EATS HAY!

05:49.332 --> 05:50.855
Pinkie, I eat hay!

05:50.955 --> 05:52.247
You eat hay!

05:52.347 --> 05:56.019
Yeah, but I heard it's
the eeevil way she eats hay.

05:56.020 --> 05:58.241
Hey! Where's Apple Bloom?

05:58.242 --> 05:59.688
The door's open!

06:00.287 --> 06:01.767
She went outside!

06:01.768 --> 06:04.039
And Zecora is still out there!

06:04.518 --> 06:07.633
That silly lil' filly...
I told her to stay put!

06:08.171 --> 06:10.929
Spike, you stay here in case
Apple Bloom comes back.

06:11.111 --> 06:12.076
Will do!

06:36.842 --> 06:37.748
Apple Bloom!

06:39.812 --> 06:41.940
You get back here right now!

06:42.406 --> 06:44.988
Beware! Beware, you ponyfolk!

06:45.088 --> 06:47.390
Those leaves of blue are not a joke!

06:48.409 --> 06:51.785
You... You keep your crazy mumbo-jumbo
to yourself, ya hear?

06:57.128 --> 06:58.374
Oh, brother.

06:58.862 --> 07:01.845
Beware! Beware!

07:02.337 --> 07:04.714
Yeah! Back at you, Zecora!

07:04.715 --> 07:07.812
You and your lame curse
are the ones who better beware.

07:08.276 --> 07:09.322
And you.

07:09.323 --> 07:11.525
Why couldn't you just listen to your big sister?

07:11.825 --> 07:12.945
I... I...

07:13.085 --> 07:16.077
Who knows what kind of nasty curse
Zecora could have just put on you?

07:16.306 --> 07:17.681
Just like in my song!

07:17.874 --> 07:20.258
<i>Evil enchantress! With the dances!</i>

07:20.259 --> 07:21.639
<i>And the trances!</i>

07:21.640 --> 07:24.164
You guys, there's no such thing as curses!

07:24.464 --> 07:28.705
Well, that's interesting to hear
coming from from Miss Magic Pants herself.

07:29.188 --> 07:31.959
My magic, real magic comes from within.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.567
It's the skill you're born with.

07:33.856 --> 07:36.026
Curses are artificial. Fake magic.

07:36.027 --> 07:38.592
It's cantrip with potions and incantations.

07:38.593 --> 07:40.311
All smoke and mirrors meant to scare.

07:40.312 --> 07:42.338
But curses have no real power.

07:42.339 --> 07:43.996
They're just an old pony tale.

07:44.739 --> 07:46.395
Just you wait, Twilight.

07:46.396 --> 07:48.971
You're gonna learn that some pony tales...

07:49.158 --> 07:50.917
...really are true.

07:56.618 --> 07:59.719
<i>She's an evil enchantress!
She does evil dances!</i>

07:59.720 --> 08:03.763
BEWAAARE! BEWAAARE!

08:04.183 --> 08:07.501
<i>If you look deep in her eyes
She will put you in trances!</i>

08:07.701 --> 08:09.637
Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!

08:09.638 --> 08:11.856
-Wicked, wicked zebra!
-A curse.

08:11.857 --> 08:13.344
<i>Then what will she do?</i>

08:13.532 --> 08:15.305
Just you wait, Twilight.

08:15.306 --> 08:17.892
Some pony tales really are true.

08:17.893 --> 08:20.705
<i>Then she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew!</i>

08:20.905 --> 08:23.071
Sooo... WATCH OUT!

08:31.404 --> 08:33.471
Ugh... What a dream.

08:33.660 --> 08:35.268
Curses-shmurses.

08:36.256 --> 08:36.982
Whoa.

08:37.754 --> 08:39.502
Maybe Zecora cursed my hair?

08:44.695 --> 08:46.304
Or she cursed my horn!

08:48.879 --> 08:50.802
No, no, no, no, no!

08:51.481 --> 08:53.089
None of these books have a cure!

08:54.090 --> 08:56.435
There has to be a real reason for this.

08:56.659 --> 08:58.602
An illness? An allergy?

08:58.986 --> 08:59.835
A curse!

09:00.077 --> 09:01.638
I said a real reason.

09:01.718 --> 09:04.026
Something that points to something real.

09:04.328 --> 09:05.402
How about this one?

09:06.263 --> 09:07.737
"Supernaturals"?

09:08.051 --> 09:12.606
Spike, the word "supernatural" refers to
things like ghosts and spirits and zombies.

09:12.706 --> 09:14.744
Which are as make believe as curses.

09:14.745 --> 09:16.687
This book is just a bunch of hooey.

09:17.805 --> 09:19.750
But what if you're wrong, Twilight?

09:19.751 --> 09:20.921
What if this really is a...

09:22.786 --> 09:24.785
"A purse"? How could it be a purse?

09:24.905 --> 09:27.331
Pinkie! What happened?

09:30.601 --> 09:33.656
Hey! Say it, don't spray it, Pinkie.

09:36.848 --> 09:39.105
She's... trying to say... ow...

09:39.311 --> 09:40.617
...Zecora... ow...

09:40.889 --> 09:43.094
...she zapped us all with a... ow!

09:43.457 --> 09:44.396
...curse!

09:44.476 --> 09:46.023
I'm afraid I have to agree.

09:48.915 --> 09:51.187
I hate to say I told you so, Twilight...

09:51.188 --> 09:52.773
...but I told you so!

09:53.987 --> 09:55.757
It's a curse, I tells you!

09:56.386 --> 09:58.977
But Fluttershy seems just fine.

09:59.467 --> 10:02.218
Yes. There doesn't seem to be
a thing wrong with her.

10:02.628 --> 10:05.297
Fluttershy? Are you okay?

10:06.616 --> 10:08.282
Is there something wrong with you?

10:09.920 --> 10:11.089
Would you care to tell us?

10:12.503 --> 10:14.899
So... you're not gonna tell us.

10:16.576 --> 10:18.456
Yes, you're not or yes, you will?

10:18.862 --> 10:21.676
Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?

10:23.135 --> 10:25.100
I don't wanna talk about it.

10:27.577 --> 10:29.237
This is hilarious!

10:29.927 --> 10:31.390
Look at all of you. We got...

10:31.391 --> 10:32.471
Hairity...

10:32.547 --> 10:33.895
Rainbow Crash...

10:34.071 --> 10:35.266
Spitty Pie...

10:35.267 --> 10:36.535
Appletini...

10:36.536 --> 10:37.417
Flutterguy...

10:37.418 --> 10:38.105
And...

10:40.209 --> 10:41.049
I got nuthin'.

10:41.416 --> 10:44.902
Twilight Sparkle. I mean, seriously,
I can't even work with that.

10:45.976 --> 10:47.318
This is no joke, Spike.

10:47.319 --> 10:49.925
Now start looking for more
books so I can find a cure.

10:56.272 --> 10:59.646
I think we'll find a cure
for this curse at Zecora's place.

10:59.841 --> 11:00.822
It's not a curse!

11:02.409 --> 11:03.913
I agree with Dash.

11:04.083 --> 11:07.491
We'll go to Zecora's and force her
to remove this hex.

11:07.769 --> 11:09.437
It's not a hex either!

11:14.245 --> 11:15.409
This is all my fault.

11:15.410 --> 11:19.431
If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place,
none of this would have happened.

11:19.631 --> 11:21.516
I just gotta fix this.

11:22.854 --> 11:25.420
Now where does she think she's goin' this time?

11:28.270 --> 11:30.333
I don't care what you say, Twilight.

11:30.334 --> 11:33.135
It's time to pony up and confront Zecora.

11:33.136 --> 11:35.408
Come on, girls! Are you with me?

11:36.463 --> 11:37.747
And I as well.

11:38.059 --> 11:42.006
Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.

11:44.223 --> 11:45.574
How about you, Applejack?

11:46.321 --> 11:47.296
Applejack?

11:47.807 --> 11:49.037
[She's gone!]

11:50.061 --> 11:51.181
Has somepony stepped on her?!

11:53.938 --> 11:55.260
Or sat on her?

11:58.499 --> 11:59.632
Rarity's hair!

12:00.062 --> 12:02.505
Oh! Oh! Pinkie, what are you doing?

12:03.575 --> 12:06.011
Really... Ah! Ever heard of personal space?

12:06.459 --> 12:07.255
[Nope!]

12:07.548 --> 12:09.135
Apple Bloom is gone too!

12:09.372 --> 12:11.422
I bet they went after Zecora.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.947
Well, we better go find them.

12:13.796 --> 12:15.493
Come on, girls. Let's go!

12:15.936 --> 12:17.675
Ooh! Oh dear, ugh...

12:17.676 --> 12:19.987
Oh, this is so unseemly...

12:20.665 --> 12:22.698
Hey! A little help here?

12:23.079 --> 12:24.988
Oopsie. Sorry.

12:27.683 --> 12:28.466
Ow!

12:30.473 --> 12:32.157
Uh... Spike?

12:32.657 --> 12:33.891
Are you coming?

12:33.969 --> 12:34.650
Nope!

12:36.282 --> 12:38.406
Gotta stay here and look for the cure.

12:39.838 --> 12:40.956
Twilight Flopple!

12:45.625 --> 12:47.323
Stop it right there!

12:49.299 --> 12:51.379
Turn around right now, missy!

12:52.767 --> 12:53.507
No.

12:53.835 --> 12:57.609
No?! You can't ignore direct order
from your big sister!

13:01.402 --> 13:04.873
Sorry, Applejack. But *I'm* the big sister now.

13:05.355 --> 13:08.450
Apple Bloom! You come back here
right this instant!

13:08.715 --> 13:11.270
I'm gonna tell Big Macintosh on you!

13:12.872 --> 13:14.974
Oh, pony feathers.

13:17.132 --> 13:19.190
Come on, girls. We've got to get to Zecora's.

13:19.352 --> 13:20.055
Hurry!

13:23.852 --> 13:25.269
Easier said than done.

13:25.296 --> 13:27.296
Heeey! Wait for me!

13:35.787 --> 13:37.920
Rainbow! Thank Celestia.

13:37.921 --> 13:39.327
There's no time to lose!

13:43.322 --> 13:45.559
I need to get to Zecora's pronto.

13:45.639 --> 13:46.862
Get it up, pony!

13:46.863 --> 13:48.947
Excuse me!?

13:49.281 --> 13:51.166
YEEHAW!

13:51.968 --> 13:52.730
What the...

13:53.804 --> 13:55.831
No, Rainbow Dash! Other way!

14:03.274 --> 14:04.691
I look horrible!

14:05.088 --> 14:07.147
[No. This looks horrible.]

14:07.148 --> 14:10.586
Oh my. That place really does look horrible.

14:13.011 --> 14:16.395
Nice decorations. If you like creepy!

14:34.110 --> 14:35.597
"She stole your song?"

14:35.904 --> 14:38.588
Oh, Pinkie. Doesn't sound anything like your song.

14:47.398 --> 14:51.699
<i>She's an evil enchantress
And she does evil dances</i>

14:51.700 --> 14:56.163
<i>And if you look deep in her eyes
She will put you in trances</i>

14:56.164 --> 14:59.209
<i>Then what will she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew</i>

14:59.210 --> 15:03.178
<i>And she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew</i>

15:03.596 --> 15:06.590
<i>So... watch out.</i>

15:07.048 --> 15:08.798
You saw those terrible things.

15:08.898 --> 15:10.777
Now you believe us, Twilight?

15:12.135 --> 15:16.690
Scary looking masks, confusing incantations
and a great, big, bubbling cauldron?

15:17.603 --> 15:20.548
Oh. Everything is pointing to Zecora being...

15:20.898 --> 15:21.867
...bad.

15:22.332 --> 15:23.419
Or...

15:23.677 --> 15:25.738
What if Zecora is just making soup?

15:28.540 --> 15:31.451
The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume.

15:31.712 --> 15:35.574
Now, where is that little Apple Bloom?

15:36.210 --> 15:37.026
Or...

15:37.027 --> 15:39.554
What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?

15:41.906 --> 15:44.361
What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?

15:48.976 --> 15:51.208
I'm coming for ya, Apple Bloom!

15:55.518 --> 15:56.491
Ho there!

15:57.367 --> 15:58.961
Heel, Rainbow Crash!

16:03.933 --> 16:05.635
What have you done with Apple Bloom?!

16:05.771 --> 16:07.366
No! No!

16:21.414 --> 16:23.258
Ponies! What is this...

16:24.983 --> 16:27.663
No! You know not what you do!

16:27.664 --> 16:30.171
You've gone and spilled my precious brew.

16:30.670 --> 16:32.192
We're on to you, Zecora.

16:32.193 --> 16:34.147
I didn't wanna believe that you cursed us...

16:34.148 --> 16:36.150
...but the evidence is overwhelming.

16:36.535 --> 16:38.276
You made me look ridiculous!

16:38.376 --> 16:40.588
You made me sound ridiculous!

16:43.590 --> 16:45.221
You ruined my horn!

16:45.601 --> 16:46.942
How dare you!?

16:46.943 --> 16:49.956
You destroy my home, destroy my work...

16:49.957 --> 16:52.784
...then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?

16:53.221 --> 16:56.497
You put this curse on us,
now you're gonna uncurse us!

16:56.498 --> 16:59.189
It is unwise to venture down this road.

16:59.672 --> 17:02.483
Your actions will make my anger explode!

17:02.766 --> 17:04.917
Where is Apple Bloom?!

17:06.022 --> 17:09.220
Zecora! I think I found
all the things you asked for.

17:10.036 --> 17:12.663
What in Ponyville is going on here?

17:13.847 --> 17:16.299
Apple Bloom! You're okay!

17:16.300 --> 17:17.344
Why wouldn't I be?

17:17.345 --> 17:21.645
Because Zecora is an evil enchantress, who
cursed us and was gonna cook you up in a soup!

17:24.027 --> 17:25.386
Oh, Twilight.

17:25.387 --> 17:28.394
Did those silly fillies finally get in your head?

17:28.395 --> 17:30.685
You know there's no such thing as a curse.

17:30.951 --> 17:35.029
Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just
stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.

17:35.641 --> 17:37.365
This isn't a curse.

17:37.647 --> 17:41.991
If you will remember back,
the words I spoke were quite exact.

17:42.888 --> 17:45.614
Beware. Beware, you ponyfolk.

17:45.714 --> 17:48.049
Those leaves of blue are not a joke.

17:49.438 --> 17:52.537
It was a warnin'. About that blue plant.

17:52.538 --> 17:54.134
It's called poison joke.

17:54.767 --> 17:57.098
That plant is much like poison oak.

17:57.135 --> 17:59.724
But its results are like a joke.

18:00.274 --> 18:02.453
What in the hay does that mean?

18:02.522 --> 18:05.360
It means this plant does not breed wrath.

18:05.361 --> 18:08.316
Instead this plant just wants a laugh.

18:09.418 --> 18:11.850
Will somepony please talk normal?

18:12.011 --> 18:16.020
I think what she's saying is that
when we ran in to save Apple Bloom...

18:16.021 --> 18:18.022
...we ran into the poison joke.

18:18.469 --> 18:21.264
All our problems are just little jokes it played on us!

18:21.655 --> 18:23.149
LITTLE JOKES?!

18:23.242 --> 18:24.290
Very funny.

18:24.434 --> 18:25.584
Okay, fine.

18:25.585 --> 18:27.652
But... what about the cauldron?

18:27.653 --> 18:28.986
And the chanting.

18:28.987 --> 18:30.580
And a creepy decor.

18:31.167 --> 18:34.139
Treasures of the native land where I am from.

18:34.333 --> 18:38.439
This one speaks "hello" and this "welcome".

18:38.663 --> 18:41.299
Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.

18:41.414 --> 18:44.035
The words I chanted were from olden times.

18:44.036 --> 18:46.682
Something you call a nursery rhyme.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.528
But... the cauldron... the Apple Bloom soup...

18:50.949 --> 18:54.034
Lookie here, Twilight.
That pot o' water wasn't for me.

18:54.035 --> 18:56.049
It was for all these herbal ingredients.

18:56.358 --> 18:59.563
The cure for poison joke is
a simple all-natural remedy.

18:59.887 --> 19:01.467
You just gotta take a bubble bath.

19:02.776 --> 19:06.162
But I tried to find a cure in all my books
and couldn't find anything.

19:06.163 --> 19:08.608
What book has this "natural remedy"?

19:08.910 --> 19:10.835
Here is the book, you see?

19:11.364 --> 19:13.969
Sad that you lack it in your library.

19:14.874 --> 19:17.183
Actually, I do have this book.

19:17.410 --> 19:20.215
But I didn't look inside,
because the title was so...

19:20.516 --> 19:21.529
...weird.

19:21.985 --> 19:26.566
"Supernaturals: natural remedies
and cure-alls that are simply... super."

19:27.336 --> 19:28.859
I... I...

19:28.860 --> 19:30.577
I'm so sorry, Zecora.

19:30.938 --> 19:34.975
I had the answer the whole time
if only I bothered to look inside.

19:36.296 --> 19:39.325
Maybe next time you will take a second look.

19:39.326 --> 19:41.698
And not judge the cover of the book.

19:43.166 --> 19:47.422
Zecora, would you be kind enough to mix up
another batch of the herbal bath?

19:47.783 --> 19:49.827
Mix it up I certainly will.

19:49.927 --> 19:53.155
Yet I am missing an herb from Ponyville.

19:53.515 --> 19:58.077
But whenever Zecora comes to town,
all the shops are mysteriously closed.

19:58.568 --> 20:01.747
Oh, well... I think we can help you with that.

20:05.286 --> 20:07.503
Look, Rose! How awful!

20:07.504 --> 20:09.984
The wicked enchantress has cursed them all!

20:10.772 --> 20:12.949
The horror! The horror!

20:22.865 --> 20:24.839
Daisy, we need to talk.

20:26.502 --> 20:28.246
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:28.247 --> 20:31.517
"My friends and I all learned
an important lesson this week:"

20:31.741 --> 20:33.511
"Never judge a book by its cover."

20:33.823 --> 20:36.966
"Someone may look unusual or funny or scary..."

20:37.106 --> 20:40.173
"...but you have to look past that
and learn who they are inside."

20:40.569 --> 20:42.763
"Real friends don't care what your cover is."

20:42.923 --> 20:45.140
"It's the contents of the pony that count."

20:45.362 --> 20:49.264
"And a good friend, like a good book,
is something that will last forever."

20:49.305 --> 20:51.994
"Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

20:52.430 --> 20:56.032
Miss Zecora, I would love to
get the recipe for this bath.

20:56.033 --> 20:57.990
It's simply luxurious.

20:58.813 --> 21:02.112
Applejack! Hey, where is Applejack?!

21:04.498 --> 21:06.967
I'm right here, lil' sis.

21:06.968 --> 21:08.711
I ain't tiny no more.

21:08.939 --> 21:14.171
Oh, I have never felt so lovely
in all of my life!

21:14.172 --> 21:17.348
Oh my gosh! I never realized
how horrible is not to be able to talk!

21:17.349 --> 21:21.157
I mean I love talking so much and I couldn't
talk at all when my tongue was all EEEH!

21:21.158 --> 21:23.514
It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?

21:25.128 --> 21:26.074
Yes.

21:30.411 --> 21:33.911
