00:08.832 --> 00:11.237
Greetings, Tantabus. I am ready.

00:11.540 --> 00:12.912
Do your worst.

00:19.957 --> 00:22.928
Princess Luna's turning into
Nightmare Moon...again!

00:30.176 --> 00:32.597
Yeah? Well, we've got
the cure for that!

00:51.824 --> 00:54.720
Wait! What is it doing?

00:57.013 --> 00:59.413
NO! It's gone!

01:08.922 --> 01:09.630
What?

01:09.973 --> 01:12.230
My dream ended happily?

01:12.560 --> 01:14.725
That cannot happen!

01:20.114 --> 01:21.847
Regular by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

01:52.533 --> 01:54.880
Ooh! This is amazing!

01:56.453 --> 01:59.386
Yeah, Rarity, thanks
for setting all this up.

02:00.053 --> 02:03.333
A grooming day for our pets
really was a great idea.

02:10.405 --> 02:12.930
Oh my! Oh I'm sorry!

02:13.306 --> 02:16.064
I didn't get my normal
beauty sleep last night.

02:17.541 --> 02:21.445
You know, I didn't
sleep well either.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.616
I'm totally beat, too!

02:27.429 --> 02:30.058
All right, Winona,
time fer yer brushin'.

02:37.296 --> 02:40.790
Whoops. I guess I'm too plumb
tuckered out to do this right.

02:43.146 --> 02:45.018
I even went to bed
early last night.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.994
But then I had a
really scary nightmare.

02:48.394 --> 02:49.824
Me too!

02:50.170 --> 02:53.300
Uh, only, you know, I didn't
think mine was THAT scary.

02:53.584 --> 02:57.034
Well, mine sure was. There was
this blue smoke monster and-

02:59.290 --> 02:59.984
What?

03:00.192 --> 03:03.045
I dreamt about a blue
smoke thingy too!

03:03.082 --> 03:04.340
Me too!

03:04.661 --> 03:07.480
So what? Probably
just a coincidence.

03:07.706 --> 03:10.069
That's an awfully
big coincidence.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.645
Huh. I wonder why I didn't
have that nightmare.

03:12.805 --> 03:14.037
I slept great!

03:15.904 --> 03:19.830
So then what could have given
us all the same nightmare?

03:20.293 --> 03:22.954
I don't know. But I
do know who might.

03:23.093 --> 03:25.701
Spike, could you send a
scroll to Princess Luna?

03:25.968 --> 03:26.500
Sure.

03:27.738 --> 03:28.458
All set!

03:28.810 --> 03:32.581
Dear Princess Luna. Last night,
my friends and I all dreamt

03:32.600 --> 03:34.629
of a creature made
of blue smoke.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.264
I'm sure you're very busy, but

03:39.034 --> 03:40.448
when you have the chance,

03:40.725 --> 03:43.664
please let me know if you have
any idea what it could mean.

03:43.978 --> 03:48.154
Yours, Princess
Twilight Sparkle.

03:48.245 --> 03:49.738
You can leave out the yawns.

03:57.216 --> 03:59.818
Which of you saw the creature of
blue smoke in your nightmare?

04:00.144 --> 04:02.272
Wow! That was fast!

04:02.608 --> 04:03.440
We all did.

04:03.674 --> 04:05.098
Not me!

04:05.344 --> 04:07.226
Ugh! We know!

04:07.317 --> 04:10.101
So you've encountered
the smoke monster, too?

04:10.405 --> 04:12.746
The Tantubus is a
creature of my nightmares!

04:13.045 --> 04:15.077
It escaped from my
slumbers yesterday.

04:15.642 --> 04:18.192
But, how did it get into ours?

04:18.597 --> 04:20.450
The Tantabus is like a parasite.

04:20.789 --> 04:22.864
My dreams must no
longer be enough for it.

04:23.253 --> 04:25.397
Now it seeks others
to infect and corrupt.

04:25.877 --> 04:28.630
It must have learned of you six
from seeing you in my dream.

04:29.077 --> 04:31.680
Whoa whoa whoa! So what
you're saying is...

04:32.154 --> 04:35.056
You dreamt about all
of them and not me?

04:36.943 --> 04:40.312
So Smokey gave us bad
dreams. No biggie.

04:41.488 --> 04:44.048
I saw that the Tantabus
had grown more powerful,

04:44.314 --> 04:47.002
but I did not realize that
power was enough to enable it

04:47.029 --> 04:48.213
to escape my dreams.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.504
If its power grows,
it could very well

04:51.520 --> 04:53.637
find a way to escape
into the real world.

04:53.882 --> 04:57.248
It could turn all of Equestria
into a living nightmare!

05:00.992 --> 05:05.962
OK, OK, OK! I take it back. That
does sound bad! Really bad!

05:09.509 --> 05:10.661
We've prepared everything

05:10.688 --> 05:12.042
exactly as you requested.

05:13.162 --> 05:16.816
Good. As you six slumber here,
I will pursue the creature

05:16.837 --> 05:18.880
into whichever of your
dreams it infests.

05:19.194 --> 05:22.005
Ooh! It'll be like a
princess sleepover!

05:22.656 --> 05:25.893
Speaking of Princesses, aren't
you going to ask Celestia

05:25.904 --> 05:26.912
for her help as well?

05:27.386 --> 05:28.990
There is nothing
my sister can do.

05:29.312 --> 05:31.386
She has no power in
the realm of sleep.

05:31.744 --> 05:33.760
Only I can move
from dream to dream.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.430
I am afraid no pony
can help me tonight.

05:36.650 --> 05:37.509
Even us?

05:37.994 --> 05:39.050
Especially you.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.920
You have all suffered
so much because of me.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.488
You need only slumber

05:43.514 --> 05:45.510
while I hunt the
Tantabus in your dreams.

05:47.445 --> 05:50.405
I know you said no pony
can help, but I'm no pony.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.765
I'm going to stay up and watch
over you guys just in case.

05:55.290 --> 05:57.285
Oh, thank you, Spike.

05:57.749 --> 06:00.933
One good thing about not
sleeping well last night:

06:01.296 --> 06:03.424
shouldn't be too hard
to fall asleep now!

06:03.560 --> 06:05.813
Are you kidding?
This is so exciting,

06:05.946 --> 06:07.146
I don't know how
I'm ever going to -

06:42.938 --> 06:46.400
Oh my! This is simply divine!

06:49.002 --> 06:50.314
How avant-garde!

06:57.016 --> 07:00.018
Forget avant-garde. I should
have said, "en-garde!"

07:05.365 --> 07:06.128
It is here!

07:13.477 --> 07:15.664
You were such a
pretty little chiffon!

07:16.709 --> 07:19.189
What kind of monster
would do this?

07:19.616 --> 07:20.670
The Tantabus.

07:20.901 --> 07:22.298
Then let's stop it!

07:22.458 --> 07:26.618
No! Please! I don't want you to
suffer any more because of me.

07:27.813 --> 07:28.618
I will catch it!

07:39.328 --> 07:40.784
It has jumped into
another dream!

07:41.061 --> 07:42.640
I am sorry, but if
I am to stop it,

07:42.661 --> 07:44.352
I must follow it
where you cannot.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.130
Go!

07:46.672 --> 07:48.700
I shall be able to
handle things here!

07:49.989 --> 07:50.760
I hope.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.274
<i> ♪ La la la la ! ♪</i>

07:56.304 --> 07:57.800
<i> ♪ La la la la la! ♪</i>

07:57.968 --> 08:01.034
I followed the Tantabus
here. Now I need only find--

08:01.760 --> 08:04.416
Sorry! Can't help it. An
idea pops into my head and--

08:05.045 --> 08:07.205
Oooh! Cake!

08:15.578 --> 08:16.992
Eww! Cake!

08:27.072 --> 08:27.701
No!

08:27.989 --> 08:28.656
Sorry!

08:31.349 --> 08:33.557
Who wants ice cream?

08:37.370 --> 08:40.869
Hmmm. It's so nice to
be the pet for once.

08:49.226 --> 08:53.190
N-n-nice, giant, evil Angel?

08:56.538 --> 08:59.210
Whew! Oh, thank you, Princess!

09:09.504 --> 09:12.710
Now, this is what I call
an incredible dream!

09:39.541 --> 09:41.930
I can see the Tantabus has
already turned your slumbers

09:41.936 --> 09:42.810
into a nightmare!

09:43.040 --> 09:44.512
What are you talking about?

09:44.848 --> 09:46.480
This is my favorite dream!

09:51.733 --> 09:55.893
<i> ♪ We are such happy flowers! ♪</i>

09:56.176 --> 10:00.213
<i>♪ We will now sing for hours! ♪</i>

10:00.608 --> 10:04.130
<i> ♪ Aren't we unbearably cute? ♪</i>

10:04.490 --> 10:08.805
<i>♪ Watch me solo on jazz flute! ♪</i>

10:27.168 --> 10:27.744
Huh?

10:38.496 --> 10:39.184
Luna!

10:50.368 --> 10:52.202
What happened? Are you guys OK?

10:52.533 --> 10:54.714
That...that was terrible!

10:55.034 --> 10:58.234
I...I never want to have
that nightmare again!

10:59.493 --> 11:00.634
Me either!

11:02.304 --> 11:04.672
But Luna caught it? Didn't she?

11:05.088 --> 11:07.781
I am so sorry, my
friends. I failed.

11:09.125 --> 11:12.112
It will be back to infect your
dreams the next time you sleep.

11:12.997 --> 11:14.298
Oh, no!

11:15.514 --> 11:17.765
Yeah, I reckon I could
live without seeing

11:17.781 --> 11:19.440
that thing ever again.

11:19.824 --> 11:23.008
But you will. Again
and again. Every night.

11:23.130 --> 11:26.096
Until it grows powerful enough
to infect the waking world!

11:26.608 --> 11:28.565
After what I did
as Nightmare Moon,

11:29.002 --> 11:31.920
the fact that I am once again
responsible for harming others

11:32.026 --> 11:33.472
is more than I can bear.

11:33.850 --> 11:36.805
It'll be OK. Everypony
makes mistakes.

11:37.386 --> 11:39.637
As long as none of you
dreamt about another pony,

11:39.952 --> 11:42.160
the Tantabus remains
confined to your dreams.

11:42.448 --> 11:44.900
I still have a chance to catch
it before it's too late!

11:45.098 --> 11:46.837
Whew! That's good to hear.

11:47.349 --> 11:48.928
Although after you left,
I did happen to dream

11:48.930 --> 11:50.869
I was eating a giant ice
cream cone with all of Ponyville

11:50.874 --> 11:52.440
while taking a test
we hadn't studied for.

11:52.592 --> 11:56.240
See, what did I tell ya?
Everypony makes mistakes!

12:02.037 --> 12:04.757
But that means the Tantabus
could be turning every dream

12:04.768 --> 12:06.420
in Ponyville into a nightmare!

12:06.794 --> 12:07.989
It is far worse than that.

12:08.229 --> 12:11.242
Infecting all those dreams
gives it more and more power.

12:11.621 --> 12:13.893
Soon it will be able to
escape into the real world

12:13.914 --> 12:16.130
and infect Equestria with
its nightmare plague!

12:16.464 --> 12:19.270
Then you must let us help you
stop it before that happens!

12:19.616 --> 12:22.666
But how? The Tantabus
was able to escape Luna

12:22.682 --> 12:25.040
when it only had SIX
dreams it could get to.

12:25.322 --> 12:28.165
It is true. With so
many dreams to hide in,

12:28.474 --> 12:30.325
I do not know how
I can catch it.

12:30.805 --> 12:34.960
Hmmm. What if everypony in
Ponyville were having one dream?

12:36.197 --> 12:39.066
I can create shared dreams, yes.

12:39.573 --> 12:41.333
But for so many ponies at once?

12:41.781 --> 12:43.413
I have never done
anything like that.

12:43.909 --> 12:45.578
The amount of power
it would take...

12:46.101 --> 12:49.221
Well, it is worth a try.
Isn't it?

12:49.696 --> 12:52.130
Of course. I will do ing to end this.

12:52.448 --> 12:53.877
Including accept your help.

12:54.282 --> 12:56.981
I cannot allow the Tantabus to
escape into the real world.

12:57.482 --> 12:59.402
All of you must now
go back to sleep.

13:00.096 --> 13:02.874
And hope that I can
create such a dream...

13:35.640 --> 13:36.840
Meow?

13:50.976 --> 13:54.474
Big Mac! Boy, I'm glad to
see something familiar!

13:57.717 --> 13:58.746
Eeyup.

13:59.642 --> 14:00.666
Ponies!

14:01.829 --> 14:03.530
Princess Luna!

14:04.640 --> 14:06.940
There is no time for
bowing, my friends.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.540
There is something coming!
Something terrible.

14:10.325 --> 14:12.580
No! It is already here!

14:17.722 --> 14:23.258
I am so sorry. I brought this
upon you. But I will end it now!

14:31.189 --> 14:32.630
Princess! What's wrong?

14:33.866 --> 14:36.112
It is taking all my strength

14:36.181 --> 14:38.218
just to hold this
massive dream together!

14:38.624 --> 14:39.930
You will have to stop it!

14:40.352 --> 14:43.173
I truly wish I did not
have to ask this of you.

14:44.746 --> 14:45.936
Then you're in luck.

14:46.117 --> 14:47.978
Yeah! We're already on it!

15:06.416 --> 15:09.130
Please, I'll pay you anything!

15:11.381 --> 15:12.549
Ya-wah!

15:14.234 --> 15:15.008
I got ya!

15:35.733 --> 15:36.464
Oh, no!

15:37.765 --> 15:41.733
Big Mac! You can do anything
in a dream, remember?

15:55.754 --> 15:58.350
E-wheeeeeee.

16:00.832 --> 16:03.450
C'mon! If that Tantabus
thing turns any more

16:03.461 --> 16:04.608
of this dream against us,

16:04.906 --> 16:07.190
we'll be too busy saving
ponies to catch it

16:07.408 --> 16:10.976
and it'll grow powerful enough
to escape into the real world!

16:12.592 --> 16:14.869
How are we even gonna know
when it's able to escape?

16:20.826 --> 16:22.741
Oh, I think we'll know.

16:32.613 --> 16:33.909
Hurry, my friends!

16:39.189 --> 16:39.770
What the--?

16:40.690 --> 16:43.322
Please! We need your help, too!

16:47.818 --> 16:50.394
Fluttershy's right! We've
all got to work together

16:50.421 --> 16:51.968
to stop it from escaping!

16:52.309 --> 16:56.176
But how can we help? No pony
in Ponyville has your magic.

16:56.277 --> 16:57.780
Or your speed.

16:58.293 --> 16:59.248
That's true!

16:59.658 --> 17:01.301
In Ponyville.

17:01.664 --> 17:04.597
But this here isn't
Ponyville! It's a dream!

17:06.064 --> 17:07.018
Eeyup!

17:07.322 --> 17:10.060
And not just any.
This is YOUR dream.

17:10.224 --> 17:13.230
Anything you can do in your
dreams, you can do now!

17:17.157 --> 17:19.642
Well, if you're gonna dream,
might as well dream big, right?

17:20.600 --> 17:21.893
He-ya!

17:22.020 --> 17:22.900
MEOW!

17:59.170 --> 18:00.186
It's working!

18:00.714 --> 18:01.898
But it's not enough.

18:06.874 --> 18:09.856
Then do more! This
is a dream, remember?

18:37.466 --> 18:40.058
I cannot hold this
dream together much longer.

18:40.394 --> 18:44.010
Equestria will
fall because of me!

18:51.610 --> 18:54.992
Am I crazy or did it
just get even bigger

18:55.008 --> 18:56.208
after Luna said that?

18:57.397 --> 19:00.197
I think it's feeding off
your guilt, Princess Luna!

19:00.538 --> 19:04.245
If that is so, then perhaps that
is how it grew strong enough

19:04.298 --> 19:05.813
to escape in the first place!

19:07.232 --> 19:08.370
Say what now?

19:09.973 --> 19:11.722
I created the Tantabus

19:12.277 --> 19:14.341
to give myself the same
nightmare every night.

19:15.946 --> 19:19.408
To punish myself for the evil
I caused as Nightmare Moon.

19:20.010 --> 19:22.320
But why would you do that?

19:22.592 --> 19:25.290
To make sure I
never forgave myself

19:25.557 --> 19:27.898
for how much Equestria
suffered because of me.

19:28.410 --> 19:30.272
But it seems I have
not learned my lesson,

19:30.773 --> 19:33.237
for now I have only
made you suffer more!

19:36.880 --> 19:40.042
But that means you might just be
the key to stopping all this!

19:40.213 --> 19:43.002
Yeah! If it gets strong
because you feel bad

19:43.024 --> 19:45.024
about what you did
as Nightmare Moon,

19:45.354 --> 19:48.506
then you just gotta stop
feeling bad for what you did!

19:48.949 --> 19:52.976
How can I forgive myself? I am
no better now than I was then!

19:53.354 --> 19:57.936
My creation is about to turn the
world into a living nightmare!

19:58.432 --> 20:00.181
But look at what YOU'RE doing!

20:00.341 --> 20:02.298
Nightmare Moon would
have wanted the Tantabus

20:02.346 --> 20:04.474
to turn Equestria
into a nightmare.

20:04.842 --> 20:07.088
You're doing everything
you can to stop it!

20:07.344 --> 20:08.512
Don't you see?

20:08.624 --> 20:11.413
That proves you're not the same
pony you were then!

20:11.856 --> 20:14.106
Everypony who knows you
knows that Nightmare Moon

20:14.117 --> 20:15.240
is in the past.

20:15.392 --> 20:17.310
We all trust you, Luna.

20:17.536 --> 20:20.138
Do you trust us enough
to believe we're right?

20:24.992 --> 20:26.450
I do!

20:43.210 --> 20:46.176
Thank you. Thank you all!

20:53.600 --> 20:54.784
Luna did it!

20:56.992 --> 21:01.620
She sure did! Only, I'm not
exactly sure WHAT she did.

21:01.978 --> 21:04.460
Luna created the Tantabus
to punish herself.

21:04.736 --> 21:07.248
The worse she felt,
the more power it had.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.541
But once she finally
forgave herself

21:09.557 --> 21:10.800
for what Nightmare Moon did...

21:11.173 --> 21:11.700
Poof!

21:11.973 --> 21:12.608
Shhh!

21:14.740 --> 21:17.341
Huh. Wonder what she's
dreaming about now?
