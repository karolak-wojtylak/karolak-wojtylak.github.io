WEBVTT

00:14.348 --> 00:16.582
Congratulations,
Silverstream.

00:16.684 --> 00:20.086
You're officially the first
non-Pegasus Wonderbolt.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.422
Really!? That is such an honor!

00:23.724 --> 00:25.992
I don't know how to thank
you, Professor Dash!

00:26.594 --> 00:30.162
Easy. You're kicking
off our show.. right now!

00:30.264 --> 00:32.231
So get up there
and make me proud.

00:33.300 --> 00:36.235
Wait..! I don't have my uniform!

00:36.337 --> 00:38.871
Silverstream! Somehow, I
missed a class all year

00:38.973 --> 00:40.639
and the final
is today!

00:40.741 --> 00:42.274
If I don't pass,
I can't graduate!

00:53.654 --> 00:55.254
Whoa. That was weird.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.622
And that's even weirder!

01:00.094 --> 01:01.226
[slurp] Ah!

01:01.328 --> 01:02.094
Huh?

01:02.496 --> 01:04.030
Uh, this isn't mine.

01:04.832 --> 01:08.467
Waaa! Make it stop!
Make it stop!

01:13.640 --> 01:14.273
Huh?

01:28.322 --> 01:31.257
Good. You have all
answered my summons.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.226
Wait. You mean this
isn't my dream?

01:34.328 --> 01:36.295
Friends must be
dreaming together!

01:36.397 --> 01:37.829
More like a
nightmare...

01:37.931 --> 01:40.599
I know, right? How
do I pick just one?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.401
They all look so good!

01:42.503 --> 01:44.737
That's your version
of a bad dream?

01:45.239 --> 01:47.673
But why did you bring us
here, Headmare Twilight?

01:47.775 --> 01:50.709
I am not Twilight. I am
merely the messenger.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.244
You all must hurry.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.513
The Tree of Harmony needs you!

02:42.529 --> 02:43.462
Lookin' good!

02:43.981 --> 02:45.997
Spike! I have
horrible news!

02:46.300 --> 02:48.834
What's wrong? Is the Crystal
Empire under attack again?

02:49.136 --> 02:51.770
What? No! We only have
twenty highlighters!

02:51.872 --> 02:52.771
And they're all orange!

02:52.873 --> 02:55.074
How will everycreature
color code their notes!?

02:55.876 --> 02:58.510
I'm pretty sure you're the
only one that does that.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.480
Still! Twenty isn't enough
for the new school year!

03:01.682 --> 03:03.849
We've got plenty of
time to order more.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.384
The friendship students
won't be back until--

03:07.855 --> 03:09.454
Spike: Uh...now?

03:12.559 --> 03:14.059
Well, this is
a surprise.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.795
Why are you all
here so early?

03:16.197 --> 03:18.263
Did I send out the wrong
back-to-school date?

03:18.565 --> 03:20.265
Oh, we're not
here for school.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.467
Yeah, we're back 'cause
the Tree of Harmony

03:22.569 --> 03:23.535
called us here.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.539
Don't feel bad it
didn't reach out to you.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.474
We kinda have a special
connection with it

03:29.576 --> 03:30.476
after last year.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.412
But the Tree couldn't have
called you. It's gone.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.114
Sombra destroyed it.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.019
Maybe next time, ease in
with those truth bombs.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.254
What about the
Elements of Harmony?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.022
Those are gone too.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.057
But doesn't that mean
the Everfree Forest

03:46.159 --> 03:47.959
will take over Equestria?

03:48.161 --> 03:49.728
We've got that
part under control.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.330
And Sombra won't
be coming back.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.966
So...some good news, right?

03:57.371 --> 03:58.970
Can we see the tree ourselves?

03:59.172 --> 04:01.140
Or...what's left of it?

04:01.442 --> 04:03.342
As long as you promise
to stick together.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.743
The Castle of the
Two Sisters

04:04.845 --> 04:07.079
isn't the safest place,
as you may remember.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.881
Yona not scared of
puckwudgies anymore!

04:09.983 --> 04:13.318
Friends save whole
school from evil Pegasus!

04:13.620 --> 04:15.020
She does have a point.

04:22.329 --> 04:23.562
How could this happen!?

04:28.402 --> 04:30.769
If only we hadn't gone
home for summer break,

04:31.071 --> 04:32.871
maybe we could've
saved the Tree!

04:34.042 --> 04:37.042
Hmph. I wish that Sombra
guy was still around,

04:37.144 --> 04:38.744
so we could teach
him a lesson!

04:38.846 --> 04:42.280
That not bring back tree.
Or Elements of Harmony...

04:44.051 --> 04:47.719
Wait! We all saw and heard
the Tree in our dream, right?

04:47.821 --> 04:50.956
How could it talk to us
if it was really gone?

04:51.858 --> 04:54.025
Maybe, if we close our eyes

04:54.127 --> 04:56.261
and think really strong
friendship thoughts,

04:56.363 --> 04:58.130
the Tree will get better!

04:58.532 --> 05:00.565
Eh. I've heard worse
suggestions.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.043
[whispering]
Is it working?

05:12.145 --> 05:12.845
No.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.914
I guess the Tree
really IS gone.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.317
Then we need to do
something to honor it!

05:18.519 --> 05:20.485
Ah! Good idea, Gallus!

05:20.587 --> 05:23.322
Hey, maybe that's why
the tree called us!

05:23.624 --> 05:25.657
It must have used the last
of its magic to make sure

05:25.759 --> 05:27.659
we'd come here and
keep its memory alive!

05:28.061 --> 05:29.828
It did say it needed us.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.062
<i> Thorax (angry):</i>
<i> Ocellus!</i>

05:34.701 --> 05:37.402
There you are! The hive
has been worried sick!

05:37.504 --> 05:39.238
Why did you leave
without telling us?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.006
The last time you and
your friends did that,

05:41.208 --> 05:43.475
it almost brought
our kingdoms to war!

05:45.012 --> 05:47.779
Uh sorry, Thorax. It
was an emergency!

05:47.881 --> 05:50.715
Well, next time, ask
before you run off.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.484
Now c'mon,
let's go home.

05:55.889 --> 05:59.391
Wait! She can't leave!
We have a...Dragon Quest!

05:59.693 --> 06:01.127
But she's not a dragon.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.495
You know what I mean.

06:05.266 --> 06:08.700
This quest for <i>all</i> Yona
friends. Need to help Tree.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.235
And it might take a while.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.004
Can we stay,
Headmare Twilight?

06:18.312 --> 06:21.613
Well, as long you get
permission from your kingdoms,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.048
I suppose it's all right.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.850
You want that permission
slip in triplicate

06:24.952 --> 06:26.151
or is one enough?

06:27.454 --> 06:29.120
What? I like to be prepared.

06:41.068 --> 06:41.800
Yeah!

06:42.636 --> 06:44.102
Ha ha ha ha !

08:06.787 --> 08:08.754
Sandbar: Hey, you're back! Great!

08:09.056 --> 08:10.388
Since I live locally,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.157
I figured I'd do a
little cleaning up

08:12.259 --> 08:13.091
while you were gone.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.926
Give us a headstart, y'know?

08:16.463 --> 08:19.098
Sandbar. Where's the tree?

08:19.600 --> 08:22.067
I got rid of it. To make
room for our memorial.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.602
YOU did this?

08:24.004 --> 08:27.473
Uh, yeah. That's what you
guys were thinking, right?

08:28.375 --> 08:30.209
Sooo not.

08:30.611 --> 08:34.012
How can we remember the
Tree if it's totally gone!?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.247
Oh, it's not gone! Look!

08:37.618 --> 08:39.684
I planted a new Tree!

08:47.694 --> 08:50.929
Sandbar. You know that's
not the same tree, right?

08:51.131 --> 08:53.064
But it's a symbol, you know?

08:53.166 --> 08:55.200
Pony heart in right place.

08:55.302 --> 08:55.967
Gallus: [growl]

08:56.069 --> 08:57.402
That doesn't matter!

08:57.504 --> 09:00.305
This cave was supposed
to stay EXACTLY the same,

09:00.407 --> 09:02.340
so future creatures could
come visit and experience

09:02.442 --> 09:03.875
the memory of the Tree!

09:04.177 --> 09:06.945
Sorry, everycreature. I
thought I was helping.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.114
The Tree of Harmony
is a huge part

09:09.216 --> 09:10.615
of Equestrian history.

09:10.717 --> 09:14.286
If we're gonna honor it, we
need to do better than THAT.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.855
Yeah! Like, with lots of artwork

09:16.957 --> 09:19.958
that represents the
symbolism and deep emotions

09:20.060 --> 09:21.226
of the Tree!

09:21.328 --> 09:22.927
No, it should be a museum,

09:23.029 --> 09:25.196
with all the Tree's
history and artifacts!

09:25.398 --> 09:27.999
Or a really big and
imposing monument,

09:28.101 --> 09:31.169
so everycreature knows how
powerful the Tree was!

09:31.471 --> 09:33.705
I think we should turn
this cave into a place

09:33.807 --> 09:36.274
for creatures to reflect
on the Tree's true gift,

09:36.476 --> 09:38.409
the Elements of Harmony.

09:38.611 --> 09:39.778
Boring.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.112
I like my idea better.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.081
What's more perfect
than ANOTHER tree?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.883
What would Headmare
Twilight want?

09:44.985 --> 09:46.985
Yona! You've been awfully quiet.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.653
Which idea do you like best?

09:49.055 --> 09:51.156
Yona like when
friends not argue.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.458
Maybe friends
listen to each other

09:53.560 --> 09:55.259
and make plan together?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.029
All: Nah!

10:02.869 --> 10:05.203
Hey, little guy.
Need a drink?

10:05.405 --> 10:08.573
<i> Gallus: Step right up,</i>
<i> walk this way!</i>

10:08.675 --> 10:12.110
<i> Welcome to the</i>
<i> one, the only</i>

10:12.212 --> 10:15.414
<i>magical Tree of
Harmony museum!</i>

10:15.716 --> 10:18.449
Come! See the
birthplace of the Tree!

10:19.219 --> 10:21.720
Grown from the
tears of a basilisk

10:22.122 --> 10:26.859
and tended day and
night by Pony magicians,

10:27.661 --> 10:32.064
this is truly one of the
wonders of Equestria!

10:32.966 --> 10:36.101
Uh, Gallus? None of
that actually true.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.236
So? Honoring the tree
means giving it a story

10:38.338 --> 10:39.604
that creatures will
care about.

10:39.706 --> 10:42.006
It already HAS
a great story!

10:42.208 --> 10:44.109
Yeah, but mine
makes more sense.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.477
Whatever, can you
just keep it down?

10:46.579 --> 10:48.513
My sapling doesn't
like the noise.

10:48.815 --> 10:52.284
Good! It doesn't belong in
the Tree's memorial anyway!

10:52.686 --> 10:56.054
AND! If you think this is great,

10:56.156 --> 11:01.727
just wait until you see the
mystical Cave of Harmony!

11:16.109 --> 11:17.876
What dragon doing?

11:19.746 --> 11:22.047
Making a memorial
statue of the Tree.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.117
When creatures see this,
they'll be super-impressed.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.853
Uh. Look like rock, not Tree.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.255
I'm not finished yet!

11:30.757 --> 11:34.525
And honestly? I'm kinda
having a hard time

11:34.627 --> 11:36.861
remembering what the
Tree looked like.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.430
I can't believe I'm
already forgetting.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.746
Hmm. Needs more "loyalty."

11:55.899 --> 11:58.849
Careful, Yona!
It's not dry yet.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.552
What hippogriff
painting?

12:00.754 --> 12:02.921
It's the Tree, silly!

12:05.225 --> 12:09.160
See? These are the emotions
its loss made me feel,

12:09.262 --> 12:11.029
dancing with the representations

12:11.131 --> 12:12.797
of elements of harmony!

12:16.002 --> 12:17.468
Maybe I should label it.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.873
Oops! Sorry!

12:22.175 --> 12:26.010
Oh, no! Brown isn't
an Element of Harmony!

12:31.017 --> 12:34.853
Thanks, Yona! This fountain
is heavier than I thought.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.163
It's for creatures to
look at as they honor

12:45.265 --> 12:48.699
the Tree's memory in quiet
thought and contemplation.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.170
I got some help and
guidance from the counselor

12:52.272 --> 12:53.972
at our Feelings Forum back home.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.876
Only positive energy
will bloom here.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.077
<i> Gallus: WAIT! You</i>
<i> can't go yet!</i>

13:03.783 --> 13:04.349
Huh?

13:04.450 --> 13:05.716
There's a whole puppet
show of the time

13:05.819 --> 13:07.452
the Tree tested us
in the catacombs

13:07.554 --> 13:08.787
under the School of Friendship!

13:11.358 --> 13:12.657
Hey! Stop!

13:13.760 --> 13:16.128
You can't bring that hunk
of junk into my museum!

13:16.830 --> 13:20.698
It's not for your museum.
It's for my Tree memorial!

13:23.436 --> 13:25.404
So leave it OUTSIDE!

13:26.106 --> 13:28.106
It BELONGS in here!

13:31.878 --> 13:32.677
Oh!

13:35.281 --> 13:35.980
Ah!

13:39.919 --> 13:40.751
Uh oh.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.358
What did you DO!?

13:50.230 --> 13:53.464
♪♪

13:53.666 --> 13:55.600
My meditation garden is ruined!

13:55.802 --> 13:57.502
Why couldn't you have
been more careful?

13:57.804 --> 13:59.270
This never
would've happened

13:59.372 --> 14:01.206
if you all just
listened to me!

14:01.408 --> 14:03.975
And made the Tree some kind
of roadside attraction?

14:04.077 --> 14:05.944
Uh, no thanks!

14:08.548 --> 14:11.149
Headmare Twilight is gonna
be so mad when she sees

14:11.251 --> 14:13.451
what you guys did to
the Cave of Harmony.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.754
Yeah, like some rainbow
art project was better?

14:16.956 --> 14:18.022
Not cool.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.524
It's impressionism!

14:19.826 --> 14:22.126
I'm just glad the Tree
isn't here to see this.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.962
This is all YOUR fault!

14:24.364 --> 14:25.129
I give up!

14:25.231 --> 14:27.031
AH QUIET!

14:28.368 --> 14:30.435
Friends doing this
the wrong way.

14:31.137 --> 14:34.239
All remembering Tree of
Harmony for what Tree WAS,

14:34.541 --> 14:36.307
not what Tree IS.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.809
You mean "gone"?

14:37.911 --> 14:42.380
No! Yona mean, even though
Tree not HERE here,

14:42.582 --> 14:45.850
Tree here! In hearts.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.853
Tree made friendship
even closer.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.857
That's right! We ran
away to be together

14:52.959 --> 14:56.895
right above this spot, the
Castle of the Two Sisters!

14:56.997 --> 14:58.796
And later on, the
Tree tested us

14:58.898 --> 15:00.866
to show us we're
stronger as a team.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.769
It DID call us all here.

15:04.171 --> 15:08.640
[gasp] You mean the Tree of Harmony
lives on in our friendship!

15:08.842 --> 15:12.577
Wow. I can't believe we
just got schooled by a yak.

15:12.879 --> 15:16.915
Yaks know things not forever.
That's why smash and rebuild.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.084
I think we took care
of the smashing part.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.688
Then maybe we should
start building. Together?

15:23.590 --> 15:25.190
Just one problem.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.959
We still haven't decided what
we should do for the Tree.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.129
Yona have idea...

15:37.437 --> 15:39.938
The Tree! Where did
you find it?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.141
Oh, I didn't
move it too far.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.376
It was kinda heavy.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.980
And you're just
mentioning this now...

15:48.882 --> 15:51.782
What important is that
Yona bring back branches

15:51.884 --> 15:53.451
so friends can rebuild!

15:53.653 --> 15:55.553
Rebuild what, exactly?

15:55.655 --> 15:58.456
Ooh, I know! Something
that represents what

15:58.558 --> 16:02.194
the Tree is: the gateway
to our friendship!

16:03.296 --> 16:03.894
Yes!

16:06.699 --> 16:10.702
What Ponies
call it? Club... home?

16:11.404 --> 16:12.237
A treehouse!

16:12.539 --> 16:14.138
[gasp] That's a great idea!

16:14.240 --> 16:16.141
I know the tree
would've liked that.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.508
Uh huh!

16:21.982 --> 16:23.214
Help me lift this piece.

Sandbar: Well? What
do you think?

18:41.821 --> 18:44.956
It's uh ... kinda messy.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.059
Smolder: Yeah. Like a
bunch of different parts

18:48.161 --> 18:49.994
all smooshed together.

18:50.396 --> 18:52.297
Aw it's just like us!

18:53.299 --> 18:55.400
Yona think it perfect.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.167
Let's give it a try.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.913
Whoa! What's happening?

19:09.015 --> 19:10.448
It looks like magic!

19:10.750 --> 19:12.483
Everycreature, out!

19:48.621 --> 19:51.122
How.. did that happen?

19:53.526 --> 19:54.626
[echoing] Because of you.

19:54.928 --> 19:56.994
The spirit of the Tree
house would have perished

19:57.096 --> 19:58.930
without your selfless
deeds and caring.

19:59.332 --> 20:02.133
Whenever you seek
solace, come here.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.302
Your friendship,
and the friendship

20:04.404 --> 20:07.371
of future generations
will always be safe

20:07.473 --> 20:09.007
within these walls.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.046
I felt a burst of magic all
the way over at the school!

20:16.148 --> 20:17.582
Is everycreature OK?

20:18.384 --> 20:21.819
A little confused,
but definitely OK.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.055
[gasp] Where did
this come from?

20:24.657 --> 20:27.058
We were kinda gonna
ask you the same thing.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.260
It looks like part of
the Tree of Harmony.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.830
But how? I thought
it was destroyed.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.398
It was. But when we
used the broken parts

20:34.500 --> 20:36.601
to build something
new, this happened.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.504
The Tree has always
been good at surprises.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.708
When Starswirl planted
the Tree's seed,

20:43.910 --> 20:45.776
he didn't even know
what it would grow into!

20:45.978 --> 20:47.645
I guess the Tree
is still alive,

20:47.747 --> 20:50.581
changing and adapting to be
whatever Equestria needs.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.183
A cool place
to hang out?

20:52.685 --> 20:54.819
Something tells me
this is more than that.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.488
It seems the Elements of
Harmony may still be with us

20:57.590 --> 20:58.690
in their own way.

20:58.792 --> 21:01.660
Ah! That's actually
really reassuring.

21:02.162 --> 21:06.130
But why did the Tree need OUR
help to become something new?

21:06.532 --> 21:08.799
I'm not sure. If I had to guess,

21:08.901 --> 21:11.903
I'd say your friendship is
more powerful than you know.

21:12.005 --> 21:17.208
Oh, Yona know. Yona just
need to remind friends.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.810
So, who's going to
give us the tour?

21:23.382 --> 21:26.083
Why don't we all
go in.... together?
