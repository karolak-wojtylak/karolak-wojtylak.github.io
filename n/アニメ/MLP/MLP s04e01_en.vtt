WEBVTT

00:08.260 --> 00:10.620
You gotta really
flap 'em hard.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.040
Whoa!

00:15.840 --> 00:17.840
Uh, maybe not quite that hard.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.460
Whoa!

00:23.400 --> 00:25.660
Looking good up there,
Princess Twilight.

00:25.940 --> 00:28.820
Applejack, you know you
don't have to call me that.

00:28.980 --> 00:30.520
Why do you protest so?

00:30.660 --> 00:33.220
You've already given up
wearing your crown all the time,

00:33.260 --> 00:35.980
the least you can do
is embrace your new title.

00:36.060 --> 00:38.280
If other ponies want to
address me that way,

00:38.380 --> 00:40.200
I suppose it's fine. But...

00:40.320 --> 00:41.780
not my friends.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.940
It just doesn't
feel right.

00:44.710 --> 00:46.820
And neither does
all this flying business.

00:47.020 --> 00:49.540
The Summer Sun Celebration
is only two days away

00:49.600 --> 00:51.800
and I'm never going to be
ready to perform my part.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.720
Not if you spend all your
time down here you won't.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.080
Now get up there and show
everypony the big finish!

01:03.470 --> 01:06.290
That's what
I'm talking about!

01:07.200 --> 01:08.500
Waa-hoo!

01:28.040 --> 01:30.420
Wow! That was a big finish!

01:40.461 --> 01:45.698

02:16.800 --> 02:18.900
You look amazing, darling.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.940
They've really captured
your regality.

02:21.980 --> 02:22.880
I suppose.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.000
Oh, don't be so modest.

02:25.010 --> 02:27.720
<i>It's everypony's dream to</i>
<i>someday wear a crown</i>

02:27.760 --> 02:29.480
<i>and have their coronation</i>
<i>ceremony preserved</i>

02:29.520 --> 02:30.940
<i>in stained glass</i>
<i>for all to see.</i>

02:31.960 --> 02:34.500
I don't know if it's
everypony's dream.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.700
Most of my dreams
are about frosting.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.460
We'd better get going.

02:40.540 --> 02:41.900
We don't want to
miss our train.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.140
Fluttershy's
right.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.060
Don't know about y'all

02:44.100 --> 02:46.180
but I've still got bushels
to do to get ready.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.600
The official celebration
may be here in Canterlot

02:48.640 --> 02:50.780
but whoo-wee! has the
Mayor put us in charge

02:50.820 --> 02:52.960
of one heck of a
party back home.

02:54.820 --> 02:57.180
Aw, don't look like
that, sugarcube.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.360
You get to be right there
with the other princesses

02:59.400 --> 03:01.180
when Celestia
raises the sun.

03:01.220 --> 03:01.920
And I'm honored.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.100
Really I am.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.620
It's just that the
Summer Sun Celebration

03:05.640 --> 03:07.360
is what first brought
all of us together.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.660
It just doesn't feel right
not getting to spend

03:09.700 --> 03:11.980
such a special day with
my Ponyville friends.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.940
It doesn't feel right
to us either, darling.

03:15.140 --> 03:17.100
If the Mayor wasn't
so desperate for our assistance,

03:17.140 --> 03:19.540
we'd most certainly
stay here in Canterlot.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.360
<i>And of course we</i>
<i>do understand</i>

03:21.420 --> 03:23.620
<i>that your royal duties</i>
<i>must come first.</i>

03:23.630 --> 03:25.140
The Summer Sun
Celebration

03:25.180 --> 03:26.600
may have brought
us together,

03:26.640 --> 03:28.160
but it's something
much bigger

03:28.180 --> 03:30.020
that'll always
keep us connected.

03:30.220 --> 03:31.920
Exhibit A.

03:32.260 --> 03:34.220
The six of us are
united by the

03:34.280 --> 03:35.360
Elements of Harmony.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.520
No amount of "royal duties"
is gonna change that.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.140
Right everypony?

03:42.100 --> 03:43.880
Right, Pinkie Pie?

03:44.120 --> 03:46.940
Creamy, creamy frosting.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.540
You should take
that as a "yes".

03:54.080 --> 03:54.920
<i>We're going to </i>
<i>write you</i>

03:54.960 --> 03:56.120
and give you so
many details,

03:56.140 --> 03:57.760
it'll be like you're in
Ponyville with us!

03:57.900 --> 03:58.900
Right, girls?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.080
Cross my heart
and hope to fly.

04:01.180 --> 04:03.200
Stick a cupcake in my eye.

04:03.340 --> 04:04.560
<i>And you will be </i>
<i>with us</i>

04:04.620 --> 04:06.100
right after the
celebration.

04:06.180 --> 04:07.820
We already have an
appointment on the books

04:07.840 --> 04:10.640
to discuss the royal
upgrades to your loft decor.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.780
<i>All aboard for </i>
<i>Ponyville!</i>

04:17.200 --> 04:18.700
Whee!

04:26.640 --> 04:28.080
I can't help it, Spike.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.560
They've only been
gone a minute

04:29.620 --> 04:31.840
and I already feel like
I'm missing something.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.520
For the Princess.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.640
Dear Twilight, you
aren't missing anything.

04:36.740 --> 04:38.200
Your friend, Pinkie Pie.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.080
<i>That's me!</i>

04:40.200 --> 04:42.860
<i>Whoo whee!</i>

04:42.940 --> 04:44.220
But I am.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.200
I just know it.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.880
Check. Check. Check. Check.
And... check.

04:52.020 --> 04:53.000
Huh. What do you know?

04:53.040 --> 04:54.080
We're way ahead
of schedule.

04:54.180 --> 04:56.780
I credit your extremely
competent assistant.

04:58.700 --> 04:59.600
So do I.

04:59.940 --> 05:01.520
The Celebration isn't
until the day

05:01.580 --> 05:02.640
after tomorrow.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.080
We could still fit in a
quick trip to Ponyville

05:05.090 --> 05:06.400
and be back in
plenty of time

05:06.410 --> 05:08.800
to finish off these last few
things before the main event.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.200
That would be nice, Spike.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.720
But what if something
else came up

05:12.780 --> 05:13.500
while we were gone?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.460
What if we were delayed
getting back

05:15.500 --> 05:17.760
and I wasn't able to finish
everything on that list?

05:17.880 --> 05:19.760
What if we lost the list
on the way to Ponyville

05:19.780 --> 05:21.180
and then couldn't remember
which things we'd done

05:21.240 --> 05:22.200
and which things
we hadn't done

05:22.280 --> 05:23.680
and then spent so much
time trying to figure out

05:23.740 --> 05:24.920
what we hadn't done
and what we had done

05:25.040 --> 05:26.340
that we ruined the
entire celebration

05:26.400 --> 05:27.640
by not doing the one
really important thing

05:27.680 --> 05:28.720
that we were supposed to do?

05:28.730 --> 05:29.340
that we were supposed to do?

05:30.630 --> 05:33.040
Uh, so that's a "no", then?

05:33.120 --> 05:35.820
These are the first royal
duties Princess Celestia

05:35.880 --> 05:36.580
has given me.

05:36.740 --> 05:38.620
I can't risk
letting her down.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.040
<i>And I'm sure </i>
<i>you won't.</i>

05:43.480 --> 05:44.660
Your Highness!

05:46.340 --> 05:49.460
No need for that now,
Princess Twilight.

05:49.880 --> 05:50.680
Sorry.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.160
No need
to apologize.

05:53.260 --> 05:54.280
Sorry.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.500
I must admit that it is
wonderful to actually

05:58.540 --> 06:01.480
be looking forward to the
Summer Sun Celebration.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.740
What do you mean?

06:02.920 --> 06:05.520
For my subjects it has
always been a celebration

06:05.540 --> 06:08.880
of my defeat of Nightmare
Moon, but for me?

06:09.560 --> 06:11.180
It was just a
terrible reminder

06:11.240 --> 06:13.240
that I'd had to
banish my own sister.

06:14.340 --> 06:17.400
I guess I'd never really
thought about it that way.

06:17.780 --> 06:20.020
But now it has become a
wonderful reminder

06:20.060 --> 06:23.180
of her transformation
back into Princess Luna

06:23.300 --> 06:24.880
and our happy reunion.

06:24.980 --> 06:27.560
I am so pleased that you
will be playing a role

06:27.600 --> 06:28.800
in the festivities.

06:28.980 --> 06:30.520
I know it must have
been difficult

06:30.560 --> 06:33.060
to see your friends return
to Ponyville without you.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.380
Maybe a little.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.540
You may no longer
be my student,

06:36.580 --> 06:37.580
Princess Twilight,

06:37.800 --> 06:39.980
but I hope you know that
I will always be here

06:40.000 --> 06:41.080
if you need me.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.140
Just as I hope that you
will always be there

06:43.200 --> 06:44.480
when I need you.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.340
I think this guy
needs you.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.240
A message for
Princess Twilight.

06:55.460 --> 06:57.320
A letter from
Ponyville, I presume?

06:57.840 --> 06:58.820
Never mind.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.260
It's not important.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.160
Spike, where were we?

07:02.360 --> 07:03.880
About to call it a night?

07:03.940 --> 07:06.880
We should probably go over
the checklist one more time.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.420
I knew you were
gonna say that.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.260
I'll leave you to it.

07:32.780 --> 07:33.820
Huh?

07:33.960 --> 07:34.420
Spike?

07:35.300 --> 07:36.820
Check. Check. Check. Check.

07:36.900 --> 07:37.540
Spike!

07:39.480 --> 07:40.920
What time is it?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.500
It's the middle
of the night.

07:42.660 --> 07:43.820
But it could
be morning.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.600
That's just it.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.280
I can't tell.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.260
Whoa. That is weird!

07:50.580 --> 07:51.440
Come on, Spike.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.380
We have to find out
what's going on.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.180
What do you
think it means?

08:01.140 --> 08:02.920
Princess Twilight
will know.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.860
I'm sure it's just...

08:07.000 --> 08:08.340
There's certainly a logical...

08:08.350 --> 08:10.880
Your Highness, you
must come with us.

08:14.220 --> 08:16.980
It's Princess Luna and
Princess Celestia.

08:17.900 --> 08:18.960
They're gone!

08:24.580 --> 08:27.200
<i>But I don't understand. </i>
<i>Where are they?</i>

08:27.260 --> 08:28.220
We don't know.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.780
It seems that Princess
Celestia and Princess Luna

08:30.800 --> 08:31.800
have simply...

08:31.980 --> 08:33.460
... <i>vanished</i> .

08:33.580 --> 08:34.580
Vanished!

08:36.040 --> 08:37.700
This is why we
have come to you.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.880
We await your command.

08:40.180 --> 08:41.980
My command?

08:42.140 --> 08:44.500
We're officers of
the Royal Guard.

08:44.580 --> 08:46.600
We take our orders
from royalty.

08:46.680 --> 08:49.540
With Princess Luna and
Princess Celestia gone

08:49.580 --> 08:51.160
and Princess Cadance
overseeing

08:51.180 --> 08:52.600
the Crystal Empire now,

08:52.780 --> 08:55.520
that means we take our
orders from you.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.700
<i>Princess Twilight, there</i>
<i>is no time to waste.</i>

08:59.840 --> 09:01.840
<i>We need to know what</i>
<i>you want us to do.</i>

09:04.030 --> 09:06.260
I want you to continue the
search for Princess Luna

09:06.300 --> 09:07.400
and Princess Celestia.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.020
We have to find them
before ponies start to panic.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.430
There must be some clue
that can tell us

09:11.440 --> 09:13.080
what's happened to them.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.020
If you find
something, anything,

09:15.180 --> 09:16.670
<i>let me know immediately.</i>

09:19.480 --> 09:21.650
Way to take
charge, Twilight.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.260
Your Highness, news
from Ponyville.

09:24.410 --> 09:27.490
The Everfree Forest
appears to be, well...

09:28.030 --> 09:29.350
...invading!

09:33.900 --> 09:36.070
<i>Excuse me. </i>
<i>Pardon me.</i>

09:36.860 --> 09:37.800
Are you all right?

09:43.060 --> 09:45.780
My goodness, what is it
that has caused you all

09:45.800 --> 09:47.070
such distress?

09:49.040 --> 09:51.470
Whatever it is, I'm
sure it's nothing

09:51.480 --> 09:53.210
you need to really
worry about.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.290
No. You were right.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.330
You should be worried.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.080
Very, very worried.

10:08.540 --> 10:11.000
<i>Come on, y'all,</i>
<i>put your backs into it.</i>

10:16.800 --> 10:17.670
Eeyup.

10:18.580 --> 10:19.340
Nnope.

10:19.830 --> 10:20.620
Eeyup.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.010
Nnope.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.430
Eeyup.

10:24.400 --> 10:24.860
Nnope.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.800
Dagnabit! We ain't never
seen this kind of trouble

10:31.820 --> 10:32.990
with weeds before.

10:33.770 --> 10:35.390
Now that I think about it.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.560
I've never even seen these
kind of weeds at all!

10:37.930 --> 10:38.830
Have y'all?

10:39.710 --> 10:40.260
Nnope.

10:40.810 --> 10:43.260
Where the heck are these
things comin' from?

10:44.270 --> 10:47.640
And what in tarnation is
going on with the sky?

10:49.070 --> 10:51.020
<i>Oh, no you don't.</i>

10:51.780 --> 10:54.010
This is Ponvyille
territory.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.470
And we aren't due
for rain until

10:55.480 --> 10:57.520
after the Summer Sun
Celebration.

10:57.710 --> 11:00.340
You Everfree clouds need
to just head on back

11:00.350 --> 11:01.580
to where you belong.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.130
Whoa!

11:07.990 --> 11:10.860
Gonna make me do this
the hard way, huh?

11:14.320 --> 11:15.180
Hey!

11:20.220 --> 11:23.340
Hm. Something strange
about the sky.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.920
What in the name of calming
chamomile is going on?

11:48.460 --> 11:50.640
Opal Essence,
darling, I'm so sorry.

11:50.650 --> 11:53.280
I promise I'm not doing
this on purpose.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.000
It wasn't me.

11:59.160 --> 11:59.950
I swear.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.330
Sweetie Belle, if this is
some sort of prank

12:06.340 --> 12:08.170
you and your little Crusader
friends are pulling,

12:08.190 --> 12:10.090
I find very little
humor in it.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.060
<i>Rarity! You have to </i>
<i>help me.</i>

12:12.180 --> 12:14.310
I think something's
wrong with my horn.

12:28.760 --> 12:29.950
Where are we going?

12:30.220 --> 12:33.000
The Everfree Forest
is ... invading.

12:33.050 --> 12:34.270
Whatever is going on,

12:34.280 --> 12:35.700
I'm sure we're going
to need our friends

12:35.720 --> 12:37.950
and the Elements of
Harmony to stop it.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.850
I just hope we haven't
missed the train.

12:40.190 --> 12:43.950
Uh, Twilight, there
is another way for us

12:43.960 --> 12:45.700
to get to Ponyville, remember?

12:45.800 --> 12:46.280
There is?

12:49.720 --> 12:50.600
You can fly.

12:51.540 --> 12:53.230
Oh. Right.

12:55.770 --> 12:56.870
Whoa!

13:11.390 --> 13:13.450
Something very
strange is going on and--

13:15.890 --> 13:18.360
I for one would
appreciate an explanation.

13:18.510 --> 13:20.700
All I know is the
sky's split in two

13:20.720 --> 13:23.800
and these clouds moving in
sure aren't from around here.

13:23.820 --> 13:26.170
<i>Neither are all</i>
<i>these crazy plants.</i>

13:27.610 --> 13:29.940
They're comin' from
the Everfree Forest.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.300
And try as we might,
us Earth Ponies

13:32.330 --> 13:34.000
can't do anything
to get rid of 'em.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.760
Don't suppose you
know any magic

13:35.770 --> 13:37.320
that might stop 'em
from spreadin'?

13:37.720 --> 13:40.280
Alas, this whole "raging
forest" situation

13:40.320 --> 13:42.170
seems to have left my
horn on the fritz.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.200
We have to figure
out something.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.580
I don't know how
much more of this

13:45.600 --> 13:46.860
Ponyville can take.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.950
I don't know how
much more I can take.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.990
<i>The Forest is
expandin', y'all.</i>

13:53.020 --> 13:54.920
And judgin' by how
fast it's movin',

13:55.050 --> 13:57.850
it doesn't seem content just
takin' over Ponyville.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.240
I reckon before long, it'll
cover half of Equestria.

14:14.430 --> 14:16.590
Whoa!

14:21.220 --> 14:25.170
I'm starting to wish
we'd taken the train!

14:25.200 --> 14:26.320
Almost there.

14:26.330 --> 14:27.130
Come on, Spike.

14:27.220 --> 14:28.870
We need to get the
Elements of Harmony

14:28.880 --> 14:30.030
and find the others.

14:31.340 --> 14:33.180
Incoming!

14:35.610 --> 14:36.810
Whoa!

14:43.530 --> 14:44.930
Oh, thank goodness.

14:45.170 --> 14:47.040
Oh, I hope you know we
wouldn't normally

14:47.060 --> 14:48.730
go through your books
without permission.

14:49.770 --> 14:50.600
Sweet ground.

14:51.510 --> 14:54.410
Sweet, sweet,
wonderful ground.

14:54.730 --> 14:56.220
OK, I get it!

14:56.240 --> 14:57.900
I need to work
on my flying.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.280
I don't know if
you've noticed,

14:59.370 --> 15:01.900
but the Everfree Forest is
just a teeny-tiny bit

15:02.040 --> 15:02.870
out of control.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.120
Guess it turned out you
were missing something

15:08.130 --> 15:09.820
here in Ponyville
after all.

15:12.380 --> 15:13.850
But perhaps you
already know

15:13.860 --> 15:15.630
what's causing all
of this calamity?

15:15.780 --> 15:18.000
Has Princess Celestia
sent you to dispel it

15:18.030 --> 15:18.760
post haste?

15:18.940 --> 15:20.860
Not exactly.

15:21.180 --> 15:23.520
You see, Princess
Celestia is,

15:23.570 --> 15:26.820
well, she and Princess
Luna are both...

15:27.200 --> 15:28.510
They're missing!

15:30.560 --> 15:32.100
I don't know who
has taken them.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.660
But I've got a hunch
we're going to need

15:33.670 --> 15:35.700
the Elements of Harmony
to get them back.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.330
Oh yeah.

15:37.530 --> 15:39.050
Just like old times.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.320
Aaa-boo-yah!

15:45.760 --> 15:48.320
I told you we'd always be
connected by the Elements.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.890
Now we just gotta
figure out who to aim

15:50.910 --> 15:53.770
these bad boys at so we can
get Celestia and Luna back

15:53.870 --> 15:56.670
and keep the rest of Equestria
from becoming plant food.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.080
Any ideas?

15:58.220 --> 15:59.190
Hmmm.

15:59.390 --> 16:01.420
<i>I haven't found squat</i>
<i>in any of the books</i>

16:01.430 --> 16:02.510
<i>I've been looking through.</i>

16:03.680 --> 16:05.660
Oopies. Missed a spot.

16:07.380 --> 16:09.040
Half-day. Half-night.

16:09.470 --> 16:10.900
Strange weather patterns.

16:11.050 --> 16:12.670
Out of control plants.

16:13.150 --> 16:16.170
I think I'm starting to
get a pretty good idea

16:16.180 --> 16:17.300
of who we're up against.

16:44.430 --> 16:45.630
Winter wrap up.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.630
Winter wrap up-- Ooooh!

16:47.660 --> 16:52.000
Ho ho! Now Twilight,
you know Princess Celestia

16:52.010 --> 16:53.840
said that you were to
give me a heads-up

16:53.850 --> 16:57.600
before you summoned me with
that little spell she gave you.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.330
In case you
haven't noticed,

16:59.470 --> 17:01.690
I was in the middle of
a particularly

17:01.710 --> 17:03.730
invigorating shower.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.050
Enough!

17:05.110 --> 17:07.670
Release Princess Celestia
and Princess Luna

17:07.680 --> 17:10.000
and stop the Everfree
Forest from invading!

17:12.270 --> 17:14.830
Why whatever are
you talking about?

17:15.390 --> 17:17.580
Don't you play dumb
with us, Discord.

17:17.650 --> 17:19.630
We know you're the one
behind all of this.

17:21.420 --> 17:24.560
Don't get me wrong, I
absolutely LOVE

17:24.570 --> 17:25.840
what you've done
with the place,

17:26.300 --> 17:29.110
but I couldn't possibly
take responsibility.

17:29.370 --> 17:30.560
I'm reformed.

17:30.590 --> 17:31.740
Don't you remember?

17:32.530 --> 17:33.610
Yeah. Right.

17:34.040 --> 17:37.080
This has got your cloven
hoof-prints all over it.

17:37.090 --> 17:41.210
I'll have you know that I
have only one cloven hoof.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.630
Such accusations.

17:45.650 --> 17:48.170
And here I thought
we were friends.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.400
Drop the act, Buster!
We're onto you.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.360
<i>Ladies, ladie,</i>
<i>I'm innocent.</i>

17:54.400 --> 17:56.370
Would I lie to you?

17:56.680 --> 17:57.710
<i>Yes!</i>

17:57.740 --> 17:59.260
<i>Um? Maybe?</i>

18:00.300 --> 18:03.160
Well, then, it seems
we've reached an impasse.

18:03.190 --> 18:05.960
I'm telling the truth,
but you think I'm lying.

18:06.010 --> 18:08.460
What do friends like us do
in a situation like this,

18:08.480 --> 18:10.670
Princess Twilight?

18:10.720 --> 18:13.270
Congrats by the way
on the promotion.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.440
You totally deserve it.

18:15.580 --> 18:18.250
I say we blast
him back to stone.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.450
Works for me.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.520
Here! Here!

18:22.190 --> 18:24.320
Hey! We can't do that.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.410
What if he really is
telling the truth?

18:27.680 --> 18:29.500
Well, finally!

18:29.750 --> 18:32.840
Somepony willing to give me
the benefit of the doubt.

18:32.890 --> 18:34.410
The rest of you could
learn a lot about

18:34.440 --> 18:36.840
friendship from my dear
friend, Shutterfly here.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.960
Um, it's Fluttershy.

18:38.970 --> 18:40.470
Oh, right. Whatever.

18:40.510 --> 18:41.900
If you're not the
one responsible,

18:41.910 --> 18:43.740
then help us
figure out who is.

18:43.830 --> 18:45.880
I suppose I could,

18:45.888 --> 18:48.930
but after all the hoof-pointing
and besmirching

18:48.940 --> 18:53.100
of my good name, I just
don't know if I'm up to it.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.240
Why don't you ask
your zebra friend

18:58.250 --> 18:58.260
if she knows anything?
Why don't you ask
your zebra friend

18:58.270 --> 18:59.550
if she knows anything?

19:02.680 --> 19:03.660
Zecora!

19:06.650 --> 19:09.320
From my home,
I've had to flee.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.920
The forest has grown
too wild even for me.

19:13.070 --> 19:15.230
Any idea why all
this is happenin'?

19:15.250 --> 19:18.580
I'm afraid it is a
mystery to me as well.

19:18.620 --> 19:21.700
But I may have
something that,

19:21.710 --> 19:23.630
if combined with a spell...

19:24.920 --> 19:27.460
<i>I do not dare</i>
<i>to use it myself.</i>

19:27.470 --> 19:29.400
<i>The results</i>
<i>would be tragic.</i>

19:29.410 --> 19:32.600
It only responds
to alicorn magic.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.330
Princess Twilight, you
can turn the potion

19:38.340 --> 19:39.920
from purple to white.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.340
After a sip you may see
why the sky is day

19:44.350 --> 19:45.770
<u>and</u> night.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.550
Oooohhh!

20:08.670 --> 20:10.050
Doesn't seem to be work--

20:17.950 --> 20:18.710
Where am I?

20:18.720 --> 20:21.030
Not another step.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.950
Princess Luna!

20:24.960 --> 20:26.390
I don't understand.

20:26.670 --> 20:27.580
Where are we?

20:27.680 --> 20:29.880
Why did you and
Celestia disappear?

20:30.230 --> 20:33.270
Did you really expect me
to sit idly by

20:33.280 --> 20:36.400
while they all basked in
your "precious light"?

20:36.490 --> 20:37.790
"Precious light"?

20:38.120 --> 20:41.230
There can only be one
Princess in Equestria.

20:41.310 --> 20:45.080
And that Princess
will be me!
