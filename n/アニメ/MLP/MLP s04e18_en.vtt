00:05.086 --> 00:07.717
Has anypony heard from
Pinkie Pie since yesterday?

00:10.401 --> 00:11.713
I don't see what's
so important

00:11.728 --> 00:13.840
we had to meet her
here this early.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.507
Celestia hasn't even
raised the sun yet.

00:19.467 --> 00:20.942
I hope everything's OK.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.193
Thank goodness you're all here.
There's no time to lose.

00:32.042 --> 00:32.928
Whoa!

00:34.251 --> 00:35.006
<i>Careful.</i>

00:36.878 --> 00:37.902
What is all this?

00:38.961 --> 00:40.524
My sister Maud's
going to be here soon

00:40.532 --> 00:41.303
and I need your help

00:41.311 --> 00:43.432
taste-testing my
rock candy recipes.

00:43.841 --> 00:45.966
Uh, we're happy to help
you, Pinkie Pie,

00:46.185 --> 00:48.630
but this seems like an
awful lot of candy...

00:48.891 --> 00:50.208
Even for you.

00:50.540 --> 00:53.024
I may have gone a
teensy bit overboard.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.947
Everypony ready for more?

01:39.289 --> 01:40.774
My teeth hurt.

01:42.298 --> 01:44.193
I think we've had plenty.

01:44.567 --> 01:46.755
And shouldn't you be on
your way to pick up Maud

01:46.760 --> 01:47.806
from the train station?

01:48.277 --> 01:50.068
But you've only tried
half of the flavors

01:50.076 --> 01:51.166
and we have to choose
the perfect ones

01:51.172 --> 01:53.248
before she gets here
so I have time to make more.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.492
Maud is your sister;

01:59.896 --> 02:01.551
I'm sure she'll love
your rock candy.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.590
And I'm pretty sure
you've made enough.

02:03.902 --> 02:05.525
She's only staying
for the week.

02:06.089 --> 02:08.101
It's not just
for Maud, silly.

02:08.259 --> 02:09.843
I'm making candy
for all of us.

02:11.445 --> 02:14.997
It's part of a very important,
super-duper special tradition

02:15.002 --> 02:18.103
that only the closest and
bestest of friends can share.

02:18.489 --> 02:21.295
We're going to make rock
candy necklaces together.

02:22.618 --> 02:26.419
<i>It all started when Maud and I</i>
<i>were fillies on the Rock Farm.</i>

02:27.315 --> 02:29.508
<i>She taught me the Pie</i>
<i>family rock candy recipe.</i>

02:29.717 --> 02:31.067
<i>It has a secret ingredient.</i>

02:32.039 --> 02:33.578
<i>It's rocks.</i>

02:34.597 --> 02:36.056
<i>And she showed me how</i>
<i>to string the pieces</i>

02:36.066 --> 02:37.397
<i>to make them into a necklace.</i>

02:38.550 --> 02:40.382
<i>And once we were</i>
<i>done, we'd trade.</i>

02:43.412 --> 02:45.387
Maud and I have been trading
necklaces back and forth

02:45.397 --> 02:46.435
since I moved to Ponyville.

02:46.628 --> 02:48.723
They're a sign that we'll
always be best friends.

02:49.453 --> 02:51.416
Aw, what a great tradition.

02:51.752 --> 02:52.599
Hold on.

02:52.848 --> 02:54.965
The "secret
ingredient" is rocks?

02:55.348 --> 02:55.820
Yeah.

02:56.060 --> 02:58.864
But these are a special kind
of rock that Maud discovered.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.344
What kind of a rock are they?

03:01.523 --> 03:02.930
I can't tell you that, silly.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.514
It's a secret.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.020
Now that Maud is heading off
to get her Rocktorate

03:09.030 --> 03:09.863
in Rock Science,

03:09.877 --> 03:11.539
this may be our last
chance to trade them

03:11.543 --> 03:12.952
for a really long time.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.778
I can't wait for
you all to meet her.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.780
I just know that my best
Ponyville friends

03:16.798 --> 03:20.146
and my best sister friend are
going to become bestest friends.

03:20.415 --> 03:24.019
We can make bestestest friend
rock candy necklaces together!

03:24.351 --> 03:26.454
She expresses herself through
fashion just like Rarity.

03:26.829 --> 03:29.229
And she's really smart and loves
reading, just like Twilight.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.453
And she's honest and
loves forest things

03:31.518 --> 03:33.211
and is good at games and...well?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.683
SHE'S AWESOME!

03:36.181 --> 03:37.617
She sounds amazing.

03:37.713 --> 03:39.320
But won't she start worrying

03:39.332 --> 03:41.451
if you aren't at the train
station when she gets here?

03:41.631 --> 03:42.468
She sure will.

03:44.439 --> 03:45.434
I gotta get out of here!

03:52.579 --> 03:54.560
I sure hope Maud
has an appetite.

03:54.762 --> 03:56.487
Never met a pony, or a
critter, who didn't love

03:56.499 --> 03:58.300
Granny Smith's
apple-spice muffins.

03:58.524 --> 04:00.230
Oh! It's no use!

04:00.433 --> 04:03.340
I simply cannot find
anything suitable to wear.

04:05.233 --> 04:07.609
I doubt she'll notice
what anypony's wearing.

04:07.896 --> 04:09.201
So what's the big deal?

04:09.701 --> 04:12.612
The big deal is that it will be
very difficult to show Maud

04:12.622 --> 04:15.098
what a strong fashion presence
we have in Ponyville

04:15.299 --> 04:16.971
if the most fashion-forward
pony here

04:16.987 --> 04:19.449
can't keep her hat
from falling apart.

04:20.624 --> 04:22.961
I think we're all a little
nervous about Maud's visit.

04:23.348 --> 04:24.835
She's Pinkie Pie's sister

04:25.139 --> 04:27.795
and it's obvious Pinkie really
wants us to hit it off.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.476
Being able to make those rock
candy necklaces together

04:30.483 --> 04:31.898
is really important to her.

04:32.331 --> 04:33.664
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.625
<i>WE'RE HERE.</i>

04:40.035 --> 04:40.995
Where's Maud?

04:41.240 --> 04:42.343
She's coming.

04:48.618 --> 04:49.482
<i>you sure?</i>

04:50.095 --> 04:51.406
She's not quite
as fast as me.

04:51.506 --> 04:53.865
I asked Gummy to stay with
her in case she got lost.

05:02.585 --> 05:04.161
Is she even moving?

05:07.114 --> 05:09.763
WE'RE OVER HERE, MAUD!

05:21.410 --> 05:21.937
Hmm.

05:22.554 --> 05:23.549
Sedimentary.

05:24.887 --> 05:25.278
Huh?

05:26.191 --> 05:27.898
This is a sedimentary rock.

05:30.394 --> 05:33.276
That's really fascinating,
isn't it, girls?

05:34.341 --> 05:36.171
We're just so thrilled you
could come for a visit

05:36.189 --> 05:37.281
before your big trip.

05:37.681 --> 05:39.773
Pinkie Pie has told
us so much about you.

05:40.323 --> 05:43.342
I'm Twilight and this is
Applejack, Fluttershy,

05:43.748 --> 05:45.369
Rainbow Dash, and Rarity.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.445
We're ever so
glad to meet you.

05:47.451 --> 05:49.184
We're just gonna
have the best time.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.187
Pinkie Pie tells me you
share my love for fashion.

05:56.546 --> 05:59.215
I'm really into expressing
myself through my wardrobe.

05:59.920 --> 06:03.681
And what is the delightful
frock you're wearing now saying?

06:05.102 --> 06:06.064
It doesn't talk.

06:06.439 --> 06:07.332
It's a dress.

06:08.189 --> 06:10.628
Oh! Yes. Of course.
I just meant...

06:15.383 --> 06:17.880
Uh. So this here's Winona.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.034
<i>That's Owlowiscious...</i>

06:19.457 --> 06:21.094
Tank, Opal, and Angel.

06:22.101 --> 06:24.138
Pinkie Pie told us
you have a pet, too.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.507
He's in my pocket.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.975
Oooh, You have a pocket pet?

06:29.248 --> 06:30.329
Like a tiny mouse?

06:30.528 --> 06:31.678
Or a baby bird?

06:31.830 --> 06:33.313
Or a trained butterfly?

06:34.524 --> 06:35.274
It's a rock.

06:40.380 --> 06:41.650
His name is Boulder.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.946
This is going to be the best,
most awesome, funnest week ever.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.803
I can't wait for us all
to become bestest friends.

07:01.828 --> 07:04.501
Maud? Would ya care to
try one of Granny Smith's

07:04.515 --> 07:06.037
famous apple spice muffins?

07:08.856 --> 07:11.176
Oh, uh, ha, that's not--

07:16.064 --> 07:17.455
It's crunchy.

07:19.738 --> 07:21.795
Maud's right. They
are crunchy!

07:22.883 --> 07:24.206
Yum.

07:25.227 --> 07:28.310
So, uh, Pinkie Pie
tells us you like games.

07:29.441 --> 07:32.520
Boulder and I sometimes play a
game called "camouflage."

07:33.135 --> 07:34.599
It's kind of like
"hide-and-seek,"

07:34.782 --> 07:37.082
but way more intense.

07:38.481 --> 07:39.580
Awesome.

07:45.073 --> 07:45.754
Any luck?

07:46.160 --> 07:48.376
I truly wish I had spent
more time with Boulder,

07:48.384 --> 07:50.835
because I'm having a very
hard time remembering

07:50.842 --> 07:51.910
what he looks like.

07:52.495 --> 07:54.751
It's like lookin' for
a pebble in a haystack.

07:55.012 --> 07:57.215
More like, "in a pile
of pebbles."

07:58.241 --> 07:59.949
Well, you don't have to
make it even harder.

08:00.448 --> 08:02.165
Agh! I give
up.

08:02.312 --> 08:03.281
This is impossible.

08:03.547 --> 08:05.793
It'll hurt Maud's feelings
if we all stop playing.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.133
Besides, look how much
fun Pinkie Pie is having.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.585
IS THIS IT? IS THIS IT?
IS THIS IT? IS THIS IT?

08:13.030 --> 08:14.593
Just a little longer, OK?

08:14.928 --> 08:17.465
All right. Fine.

08:17.820 --> 08:18.602
<i>Found him.</i>

08:19.986 --> 08:20.954
Where was he?

08:21.278 --> 08:23.127
He was hiding in my pocket.

08:23.701 --> 08:25.079
Oh, come on!

08:33.032 --> 08:34.236
I don't mean to interrupt,

08:34.321 --> 08:36.708
but we really should get these
little critters home.

08:36.971 --> 08:39.430
It's getting awfully late and
they've had a very busy day.

08:39.746 --> 08:41.125
Maud and I'd better
get going, too.

08:41.350 --> 08:42.643
I want her to taste
the rock candy

08:42.653 --> 08:43.689
we're going to use for our...

08:43.931 --> 08:46.087
...best friends necklaces.

08:46.253 --> 08:47.178
Oh yeah!

08:52.054 --> 08:54.963
She sure is different
from what I expected.

08:55.336 --> 08:57.180
We spent all day
digging in the dirt

08:57.319 --> 08:59.951
and he was in her pocket
the whole time?

09:00.314 --> 09:02.809
On the bright side, Boulder
seemed really sweet.

09:03.313 --> 09:04.723
He's a ROCK!

09:05.477 --> 09:06.234
Come on, girls.

09:06.292 --> 09:08.905
I'm sure Maud was just nervous
about meeting all of us.

09:09.274 --> 09:11.235
Maybe she was just
acting a little "off"

09:11.324 --> 09:12.850
because she's shy or somethin'.

09:13.045 --> 09:13.765
Exactly.

09:14.177 --> 09:17.086
It must be awfully intimidating
to meet all of us at once,

09:17.440 --> 09:19.884
especially since we're
already such good friends.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.681
Maybe if we spent some
time with her one-on-one

09:25.693 --> 09:27.038
to try to get to
know her better?

09:27.266 --> 09:30.025
I'm sure we'll be making those
best-friend rock candy necklaces

09:30.031 --> 09:30.874
in no time.

09:32.889 --> 09:33.966
<i>Where shall we start?</i>

09:34.548 --> 09:36.706
I've chosen a few fabrics
I think would be stunning with--

09:38.936 --> 09:40.679
Choices, choices, choices.

09:40.977 --> 09:43.849
Of course, if you don't see
anything that speaks to you,

09:43.861 --> 09:45.400
I would be happy to suggest--

09:45.523 --> 09:46.821
I like this one.

09:50.017 --> 09:52.839
Pinkie Pie didn't tell
us you were so funny.

09:54.688 --> 09:56.031
What do you mean?

09:56.524 --> 10:00.335
Oh, well, it's just, I
believe that is a dish towel.

10:03.711 --> 10:06.632
But, it does go very
well with your complexion.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.801
I'm sure I could
work my magic

10:08.817 --> 10:10.491
and turn it into
something fabulous.

10:11.471 --> 10:13.453
Rarity and my sister
working together

10:13.463 --> 10:15.133
to design something amazing.

10:15.436 --> 10:17.660
This is the best day ever!

10:18.384 --> 10:19.982
Perhaps I could sew
all of these together

10:19.994 --> 10:21.412
and make you something
you would like.

10:21.910 --> 10:22.608
No, thanks.

10:22.840 --> 10:23.676
One is enough.

10:25.717 --> 10:28.384
Doesn't Maud make
the coolest scarves?

10:29.186 --> 10:29.853
Quite.

10:38.232 --> 10:39.720
Hello there, Hummingway.

10:39.892 --> 10:41.765
I'm ever so happy to see you.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.141
What's he saying?

10:43.574 --> 10:46.138
He says hello, and he's
happy to see us too.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.550
I wish I could
speak hummingbird.

10:48.979 --> 10:52.085
Hummmmm, hum, hum,
hum, hummmmmm.

10:54.130 --> 10:55.828
These spiders only
live in Ponyville,

10:56.062 --> 10:58.142
and even though they may
look a teeny bit scary,

10:58.341 --> 10:59.683
they're actually
very sweet

10:59.691 --> 11:02.126
and help keep other, more
dangerous insects away.

11:02.671 --> 11:04.165
I was looking at
the rock.

11:05.123 --> 11:05.785
Oh.

11:07.164 --> 11:08.511
Thanks again, Fluttershy.

11:08.649 --> 11:10.480
Start thinking about which
flavors you want to put

11:10.497 --> 11:12.915
in your best-friend
rock candy necklace.

11:13.687 --> 11:14.398
Oh, gosh.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.729
I'm not sure we're
even friends yet.

11:18.922 --> 11:20.409
<i>Maud is a total bookworm.</i>

11:20.735 --> 11:22.011
She loves poetry.

11:22.495 --> 11:23.863
I've got lots of poetry.

11:24.343 --> 11:25.779
Do you read anything
by Quill and Ink?

11:26.154 --> 11:27.520
Or Flourish Prose?

11:28.384 --> 11:30.370
I prefer to read my own poetry.

11:31.849 --> 11:33.537
I'd love to hear some of it.

11:35.752 --> 11:37.908
Rock. You are a rock.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.079
Grey...

11:39.527 --> 11:40.437
you are grey...

11:41.075 --> 11:41.806
like a rock...

11:42.431 --> 11:43.404
which you are.

11:43.966 --> 11:44.507
Rock.

11:47.514 --> 11:48.915
I've written thousands.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.602
She's so prolific!

11:51.287 --> 11:53.324
This next one is about rocks.

11:53.908 --> 11:55.681
They're all about rocks.

11:57.523 --> 11:59.668
Rocks, these are my rocks.

11:59.962 --> 12:00.852
Sediments.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.483
Make me sentimental.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.220
<i>Smooth and round.</i>

12:04.452 --> 12:05.925
<i>Asleep in the ground.</i>

12:06.126 --> 12:08.364
<i>Shades of brown. And grey.</i>

12:14.967 --> 12:17.420
You 'bout done peeling them
apples for the cider, Maud?

12:18.230 --> 12:19.625
I think this one is done.

12:22.696 --> 12:23.754
Oh, uh, yep.

12:24.154 --> 12:26.240
That's a very interestin'
method you've got there.

12:28.743 --> 12:29.986
Should I peel another?

12:30.204 --> 12:31.783
NO! I mean, naw...

12:32.003 --> 12:33.925
I'm sure there's plenty
apples in it already.

12:34.770 --> 12:35.752
Can we taste it now?

12:36.234 --> 12:37.104
Sure, why not?

12:44.745 --> 12:45.385
WOW!

12:45.570 --> 12:47.397
That's the best apple
cider I've ever had!

12:47.890 --> 12:48.909
What do you think, Maud?

12:51.531 --> 12:53.000
It tastes like apples.

12:53.309 --> 12:54.850
Told you she was
super honest.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.474
Just like you.

12:57.160 --> 13:00.109
We're practically twins. Heh.

13:06.880 --> 13:07.621
Yeah!

13:07.861 --> 13:09.549
Let's see you beat that.

13:22.606 --> 13:24.776
THAT WAS AMAZING!

13:25.032 --> 13:26.958
Whoa! How'd you do that?

13:27.705 --> 13:28.688
I threw it.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.737
I guess you won
this one, Maud.

13:34.487 --> 13:36.899
I'm not really into "winning".

13:42.971 --> 13:44.142
Great! You're all here.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.636
Maud is off looking for rocks,
so this is the perfect time

13:46.649 --> 13:47.955
for us to set up
everything we'll need

13:47.964 --> 13:50.220
to make our best-friend
rock candy necklaces.

13:53.598 --> 13:54.263
What's wrong?

13:58.829 --> 14:02.292
Well? I'm not sure it's the
best time to make best-friend

14:02.302 --> 14:03.806
rock candy necklaces.

14:04.376 --> 14:05.139
Why not?

14:05.676 --> 14:06.099
Uh...

14:07.110 --> 14:08.866
Well, darling, you see...

14:10.700 --> 14:12.228
You're ever so
thoughtful to share

14:12.234 --> 14:14.511
your special bonding
ritual with us, but...

14:16.275 --> 14:17.629
But what?

14:20.078 --> 14:22.706
The truth is, we've all
been trying real hard

14:22.712 --> 14:25.075
to get closer to
Maud, but, well,

14:25.586 --> 14:27.287
maybe some
ponies just don't click

14:27.293 --> 14:28.273
the way others do.

14:31.262 --> 14:32.934
We just wouldn't feel
right making something

14:32.942 --> 14:36.409
that means we're best
friends if, well, we aren't.

14:40.142 --> 14:42.068
Oh. OK.

14:42.850 --> 14:46.115
If anypony needs me I'll be in
here trying to figure out

14:46.126 --> 14:48.507
what to do with 200
pounds of rock candy.

14:57.843 --> 15:00.388
<i>I feel awful,</i>
<i>just awful.</i>

15:01.625 --> 15:03.340
Maybe we should have
just pretended

15:03.354 --> 15:04.743
we were friends with Maud.

15:05.053 --> 15:06.419
If we didn't tell Pinkie Pie

15:06.425 --> 15:08.801
that we hadn't all become
the best of friends,

15:09.141 --> 15:10.675
I think Maud would have.

15:11.069 --> 15:12.905
Maybe. But who really knows?

15:13.145 --> 15:16.872
That pony is a riddle wrapped
in a mystery inside an igneous.

15:17.219 --> 15:19.555
Don't you mean
"inside an enigma"?

15:20.027 --> 15:21.920
Nope. I mean igneous.

15:22.257 --> 15:23.510
It's a kind of rock.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.670
Ask me how I know that.

15:28.474 --> 15:29.750
I've come up with
just the thing

15:29.761 --> 15:31.980
to bring everypony
closer together.

15:47.395 --> 15:50.846
I call it Pinkie-Rainbow-Rari-
Twi-Apple-Flutter-Maud

15:50.999 --> 15:51.857
Fun Time!

15:53.500 --> 15:53.990
Huh?

15:54.520 --> 15:56.035
It combines
everypony's interests

15:56.048 --> 15:57.467
into one giant activity

15:57.596 --> 15:58.805
that we can all enjoy together

15:58.817 --> 16:01.754
and that will totally bring all
my bestest friends together

16:01.978 --> 16:04.033
as bestestest friends.

16:04.872 --> 16:05.728
You'll need these.

16:07.773 --> 16:09.701
Like I said, "Huh?"

16:10.480 --> 16:12.269
Probably better
for me to show you.

16:12.612 --> 16:13.459
Watch this!

16:13.984 --> 16:15.295
Applesauce tunnel for Applejack.

16:17.578 --> 16:19.248
Pretty, shiny stuff for Rarity.

16:19.962 --> 16:21.393
Reading material for Twilight.

16:23.297 --> 16:24.891
Critter time for Fluttershy.

16:28.390 --> 16:30.066
Cupcakes for yours truly.

16:31.248 --> 16:33.322
And it's a race
for Rainbow Dash.

16:33.812 --> 16:35.978
Pinkie Pie, what is that?

16:39.043 --> 16:41.131
A rock slide, of course.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.273
For Maud.

16:43.644 --> 16:45.248
First you climb, then you slide.

16:46.249 --> 16:48.376
I've got a bad
feelin' about this.

16:53.888 --> 16:54.476
Huh?

17:01.102 --> 17:01.783
<i>OH!</i>

17:01.974 --> 17:03.516
<i>Oh, goodness.</i>

17:07.795 --> 17:08.665
Watch out!

17:08.995 --> 17:09.449
Huh?

17:10.247 --> 17:13.110
Ahhhh! Help!

17:32.513 --> 17:33.795
What? How? What?

17:38.534 --> 17:40.915
Pinkie Pie, what
were you thinking?

17:42.343 --> 17:43.701
I guess I wasn't.

17:44.694 --> 17:47.884
I know how important it is
to you that your friends

17:47.896 --> 17:49.293
become my friends.

17:49.625 --> 17:51.564
But I just don't think
it's going to happen.

17:52.107 --> 17:54.911
I think it would be best if I
just go back to the Rock Farm

17:54.924 --> 17:56.729
and spend the rest of
the week there.

17:58.842 --> 18:00.171
It was nice to meet you all.

18:00.403 --> 18:03.225
Makes me happy knowing Pinkie
Pie has such good friends.

18:04.513 --> 18:08.803
But we never even got to make
our rock candy necklaces.

18:10.199 --> 18:12.755
Wait, Maud. I'll come with you.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.904
I can't believe Maud
cut her trip short.

18:16.189 --> 18:18.318
I can't believe we
nearly lost Pinkie Pie

18:18.323 --> 18:20.255
to that ridiculous
obstacle course.

18:20.827 --> 18:23.588
Thank goodness Maud was
able to reach her in time.

18:23.765 --> 18:25.976
Did you see how
fast Maud moved?

18:26.419 --> 18:29.385
And the way she smashed
that huge rock into dust?

18:29.726 --> 18:31.982
How in Equestria
did she do that?

18:32.197 --> 18:33.465
<i>Pinkie Pie was in trouble.</i>

18:33.746 --> 18:36.382
Maud would move mountains
for her if she had to.

18:38.173 --> 18:40.901
That's it! I think
I've finally realized

18:40.913 --> 18:42.708
what we all have in
common with Maud.

18:43.036 --> 18:45.211
Something that just might be
worthy of a very important,

18:45.227 --> 18:46.413
super-duper special tradition

18:46.423 --> 18:48.878
that only the closest and
bestest of friends can share.

18:53.783 --> 18:55.139
Thank you for
coming with me.

18:55.769 --> 18:58.487
I don't know how long I'll be
gone on my rock research trip.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.898
I'm glad I still get to spend
some time with you before I go.

19:02.481 --> 19:03.361
Me, too.

19:03.783 --> 19:06.653
I'm sorry I put so much
pressure on everypony to bond.

19:07.077 --> 19:10.505
I only wanted my friends to get
to know my amazing older sister.

19:21.182 --> 19:22.788
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

19:23.525 --> 19:25.931
Pinkie Pie, we're so sorry
we hurt your feelings

19:25.941 --> 19:27.701
by not bonding with
Maud right away.

19:28.325 --> 19:31.319
And Maud, we're sorry that
you felt the only way to spare

19:31.322 --> 19:34.165
Pinkie Pie's feelings was
to leave Ponyville early.

19:35.695 --> 19:39.006
We've seen how much you care
about Pinkie Pie, first-hoof.

19:39.629 --> 19:42.729
Pinkie Pie's happiness means as
much to us as it does to you,

19:43.127 --> 19:44.932
and we're sorry we
couldn't see it sooner.

19:45.215 --> 19:47.617
The thing that makes us click
and creates a special bond

19:47.621 --> 19:50.723
between us is how much
we ALL love Pinkie Pie!

19:51.219 --> 19:52.840
Aw, shucks.

19:53.311 --> 19:55.992
That's a pretty great thing to
have in common if you ask me.

19:56.503 --> 19:57.719
<i>What do you think, Maud?</i>

20:00.068 --> 20:00.755
Sure.

20:04.770 --> 20:05.549
What's wrong?

20:06.015 --> 20:08.548
Sorry, darling, I think
we all just thought

20:08.554 --> 20:10.673
she'd be a bit more
excited about this.

20:11.112 --> 20:12.800
Are you kidding me?

20:13.160 --> 20:15.990
I've never seen her more
excited in my entire life.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.650
I don't know if you've noticed
but I don't show my enthusiasm

20:19.662 --> 20:22.234
for things quite in the
same way my sister does.

20:24.089 --> 20:25.898
Uh, we noticed.

20:26.944 --> 20:29.334
And we're totally cool with it.

20:38.831 --> 20:41.580
Maud, we'd like to give you
something to take on your trip,

20:41.966 --> 20:44.684
so that you remember all
your friends from Ponyville.

20:57.106 --> 20:57.972
Thank you.

20:58.860 --> 21:01.381
Try not to eat all the
candy before you leave.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.260
Are those all the
necklaces Pinkie Pie sent you?

21:15.459 --> 21:16.314
Mm hm.

21:17.094 --> 21:18.839
You haven't eaten any of them?

21:19.393 --> 21:20.885
I don't really like candy.

21:22.550 --> 21:24.790
But I do love Pinkie Pie.

21:28.509 --> 21:31.377
Mmmmm!
