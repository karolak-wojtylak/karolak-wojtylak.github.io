Hey, Starlight! Ready
to celebrate your first

01:42.420 --> 01:44.360
Hearth's Warming Eve
here in Ponyville?

01:44.660 --> 01:47.250
I was thinking I
might just skip it.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.648
Derpy is Best Pony!

01:56.650 --> 02:01.650
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu/

02:27.490 --> 02:29.430
SKIP HEARTH'S WARMING EVE?

02:29.920 --> 02:32.250
I just find it all
a little silly.

02:33.170 --> 02:36.930
It's mostly a day dedicated to
presents and candy, isn't it?

02:37.140 --> 02:39.520
And why would you deny
yourself presents and candy?

02:39.590 --> 02:40.870
That's crazy talk!

02:41.090 --> 02:44.020
I THINK what Spike
means to say is,

02:44.130 --> 02:46.950
Hearth's Warming is about
more than presents and candy.

02:47.190 --> 02:49.340
It's a time to spend
with friends and family

02:49.390 --> 02:51.260
when we celebrate a
very important day

02:51.300 --> 02:52.680
in Equestria's history.

02:52.870 --> 02:55.510
I think to most ponies,
it's just an excuse

02:55.560 --> 02:57.360
for silly songs and fun,

02:57.650 --> 03:00.370
not a day to remember
some old story.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.670
Maybe you just haven't
heard the right

03:03.730 --> 03:05.510
Hearth's Warming
Eve story yet.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.310
Earth ponies, pegasi
and unicorns sing songs

03:08.350 --> 03:10.690
around a hearth to fight
back an eternal winter

03:10.740 --> 03:12.470
caused by the
mythical Windigos?

03:12.590 --> 03:15.050
Every foal and fill
knows that story.

03:15.390 --> 03:18.280
Not THAT one. My
favorite holiday story.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.000
A Hearth's Warming Tale.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.000
Oooooo! I love that one!

03:24.710 --> 03:28.600
This is the story of a powerful
unicorn named Snowfall Frost

03:28.750 --> 03:30.570
who hated Hearth's
Warming Eve!

03:30.900 --> 03:33.580
It all began many moons
ago in Canterlot...

03:34.770 --> 03:37.920
Every home in Canterlot was
filled with Holiday spirit.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.550
Every home except one.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.670
It was said of Snowfall that
she was almost as studied

03:43.720 --> 03:44.930
as Starswirl the Bearded.

03:46.090 --> 03:49.650
Almost, since everypony knows
that Starswirl was an expert

03:49.690 --> 03:51.500
at everything from
transfiguration,

03:51.590 --> 03:53.960
Dimensional Calibration,
Teleportation--

03:54.300 --> 03:56.390
We get it.
Starswirl's awesome.

03:56.590 --> 04:00.610
Right. The point is, Snowfall
was also a powerful unicorn.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.670
She wanted to be perfect.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.200
Anything that got in the way
of that was a waste of time.

04:06.490 --> 04:07.330
Ugh!

04:10.150 --> 04:13.070
Well, that batch is
ruined. SNOWDASH!

04:13.520 --> 04:15.780
Snowdash was Snowfall's
loyal assistant.

04:16.420 --> 04:17.110
What do you need?

04:17.260 --> 04:18.570
Get this mess cleaned up.

04:18.860 --> 04:21.410
Those foolish ponies were
ringing those blasted bells

04:21.460 --> 04:24.070
outside the window and
I lost my concentration.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.080
Whoa. Ponies
actually enjoying

04:26.120 --> 04:29.130
Hearth's Warming Eve. Where
did they get that crazy idea?

04:29.420 --> 04:31.300
Today is nothing
to celebrate.

04:31.390 --> 04:33.260
Hearth's Warming
Eve is a menace,

04:33.620 --> 04:35.950
a dangerous day for
all of Equestria.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.280
Dangerous? It's awesome!

04:38.530 --> 04:40.980
It's the day we remember
how unicorns, pegasi,

04:41.040 --> 04:43.010
and earth ponies came
together in friendship

04:43.060 --> 04:44.880
to defeat the Windigos!

04:45.000 --> 04:47.230
That silly legend
is the problem!

04:47.540 --> 04:50.630
Telling everypony that
singing songs and being nice

04:50.670 --> 04:54.200
will solve anything? I've
spent years studying magic

04:54.280 --> 04:56.250
and that's not how it works.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.810
I think you might be
missing the point.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.140
Work hard, learn and use your
skills to better Equestria.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.460
THAT'S a worthy
goal for anypony.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.470
But by all means, if you
want to go home early,

05:09.590 --> 05:12.090
ignore all of the work you
have and spend the rest --

05:12.130 --> 05:13.250
SWEET!

05:14.230 --> 05:15.000
Ugh.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.250
I HATE Hearth's Warming Eve!

05:20.610 --> 05:22.670
All of Equestria
would be better off

05:22.710 --> 05:25.160
if we just skipped
the day all together.

And they'll have
me to thank for it!

07:44.860 --> 07:45.750
Wait a minute.

07:46.070 --> 07:48.160
Snowfall doesn't like
Hearth's Warming Eve

07:48.210 --> 07:51.500
so she decides to cast a spell
to get rid of it all together?

07:52.020 --> 07:54.540
That seems a little extreme.

07:54.860 --> 07:57.390
Says the pony who tried
to make everypony the same

07:57.430 --> 07:59.870
by replacing their cutie
marks with equal signs.

08:01.300 --> 08:04.630
I THINK what Spike is trying
to say is that everypony

08:04.670 --> 08:08.020
has their reasons for doing
things. Even Snowfall.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.200
And if I could
continue the story,

08:10.390 --> 08:12.180
we might just find
out what they are.

08:12.670 --> 08:13.590
Proceed.

08:14.300 --> 08:17.520
Snowfall was all set to cast
her spell that would erase

08:17.570 --> 08:19.500
Hearth's Warming
Eve for all time

08:19.790 --> 08:22.100
when a voice from the hearth
caught her attention.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.530
You SURE you wanna
go through with this?

08:24.740 --> 08:26.220
Who's there!

08:27.900 --> 08:31.100
The Spirit of Hearth's
Warmin' Past, that's who.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.130
And you and me have got
to have us a little chat.

08:35.450 --> 08:40.300
A spirit! I didn't cast any
spirit-summoning spell.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.250
What are you doing here?

08:42.500 --> 08:44.360
You don't think a spell
like that would get by

08:44.400 --> 08:46.320
without some powerful
forces noticing?

08:46.580 --> 08:48.920
You've got our attention,
Snowfall Frost

08:49.320 --> 08:51.430
and we've got some
pretty strong opinions

08:51.470 --> 08:52.760
on this spell of yours.

08:53.020 --> 08:53.590
We?

08:53.880 --> 08:57.290
They'll be along in a bit.
For now it's just you and me.

08:57.490 --> 08:59.690
Let's get a move on.
We got a ton to see

08:59.730 --> 09:01.070
and barely any time
to see it.

09:01.230 --> 09:03.190
I'm not going anywhere.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.760
I've got a spell to cast. And
I don't need a history lesson

09:06.790 --> 09:08.330
about Hearth's Warming Eve.

09:08.580 --> 09:11.590
We aren't goin' to the past
to learn about the holiday.

09:11.970 --> 09:14.410
We're goin' to

10:33.830 --> 10:34.900
Professor Flintheart!

10:35.580 --> 10:39.100

to be a powerful unicorn,

10:39.160 --> 10:40.840
did you not?
I do!

10:41.110 --> 10:44.830
And what is the way that one
becomes a powerful unicorn?

10:45.930 --> 10:48.340
Work hard, learn
and use your skills

10:48.380 --> 10:49.730
to better Equestria.

10:52.420 --> 10:55.900

you to learn magic?

10:56.120 --> 10:59.200

10:59.560 --> 11:02.770
That's just a story
we tell little ponies.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.400
Real magic takes
time to learn.

11:09.410 --> 11:10.450
It's your choice.

11:10.550 --> 11:13.590
Spend your time learning to
become a powerful unicorn,

11:13.810 --> 11:17.430

12:08.340 --> 12:13.860
<i>♪ All tied to this one holiday ♪</i>

12:18.570 --> 12:21.100
Spirit?
What am I supposed to--

12:24.390 --> 12:26.970
SNOWFALL FROST! IT IS I,

12:27.130 --> 12:30.330
THE SPIRIT OF HEARTH'S
WARMING PRESENTS!

12:31.430 --> 12:34.160
Um, don't you mean
present, like, the time?

12:34.290 --> 12:37.140
No. Toys, Hearth's Warming
dolls. Here! Want a cupcake?

12:38.110 --> 12:41.610
Fine. Presents. All of
the pointless things

12:41.660 --> 12:43.410
that ponies waste
their time on.

12:43.610 --> 12:46.650
Oh Snowfall. It's not what
the gift is that matters,

12:46.760 --> 12:48.570
it's what the gift MEANS!

12:49.010 --> 12:51.810
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just stuff.

12:51.930 --> 12:54.800
Exactly! Sometimes a
cupcake means I love you!

12:54.930 --> 12:56.750
Or a toy means Hi!
How ya doin?

12:56.880 --> 12:59.830
And sometimes a book means,
"Your mane looks AMAZING!"

12:59.950 --> 13:01.260
And sometimes a scarf means...

13:01.880 --> 13:04.060
well, a scarf usually
means you look cold.

13:04.270 --> 13:05.490
That one's easy.

13:06.010 --> 13:08.180
I don't understand
anything you're saying.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.800
Whoa, whoa!

13:10.920 --> 13:12.120
What's happening to you?

13:12.240 --> 13:15.560
My Spirit of Hearth's Warming
Presents-sense is going off!

13:15.770 --> 13:19.050
That means a song

What?

15:07.720 --> 15:10.420
You know you're doing your
Pinkie Pie voice, right?

15:10.670 --> 15:12.010
I was not...

15:14.050 --> 15:17.000
So what happens next?

15:17.220 --> 15:18.660
Well, the party was--

15:18.730 --> 15:20.550
WAIT! Can we take
a quick break?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.490
I need to refill my cocoa!

15:22.680 --> 15:24.010
Fine.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.190
But hurry up! We're
almost to the best part!

15:32.580 --> 15:33.950
OK. I'm ready.

15:34.970 --> 15:36.750
The party was in full swing.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.300
Snowdash!

15:38.490 --> 15:39.720
Hey, Merry.

15:40.180 --> 15:42.480
Why, whatever is
the matter, darling?

15:42.580 --> 15:43.780
Was it the eggnog?

15:43.940 --> 15:46.350
I knew I put in too
much cinnamon.

15:46.710 --> 15:49.350
Oh, no! The eggnog was
awesome, Flutterholly.

15:49.590 --> 15:51.810
I'm just mad at somepony
who was complaining

15:51.840 --> 15:53.890
about how awful
Hearth's Warming Eve is.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.030
I don't suppose that pony's
name starts with "Snow"?

15:58.230 --> 15:59.950
And ends with "frost"?

16:00.380 --> 16:03.490
She said Hearth's Warming Eve
is just an excuse to party

16:03.670 --> 16:06.130
and we'd all be better
off spending time working

16:06.150 --> 16:08.250
to make Equestria
a better place.

16:08.340 --> 16:11.080
Boo!

16:11.570 --> 16:14.480
What does Snowfall think a
better Equestria looks like?

16:14.670 --> 16:16.410
Ponies working hard.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.190
Learning.

16:17.320 --> 16:20.430
And using their abilities for
the benefit of Equestria.

16:23.015 --> 16:26.351
Yeah!

16:26.490 --> 16:29.260
It looks like we've got
everything on Snowfall's list

16:29.500 --> 16:30.400
right here.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.160
I think a perfect
Equestria looks a lot like

16:33.200 --> 16:34.940
a Hearth's Warming Eve party.

16:37.650 --> 16:42.590
Me too. Too bad it's going
to be the last one EVER!

16:42.750 --> 16:45.830
Ever...ever...ever.

16:46.660 --> 16:50.380
Spirit? What do you mean?
What's going to happen?

16:58.350 --> 16:59.540
Who are you?

16:59.880 --> 17:02.840
I am the Spirit of Hearth's
Warming Yet to Come.

17:03.740 --> 17:05.240
Are you here to show me

17:05.270 --> 17:07.400
what future Hearth's
Warming Eves are like?

17:07.590 --> 17:11.130
No. For there are no more
Hearth's Warming Eves

17:11.180 --> 17:12.220
for me to show.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.450
Why not?

17:13.730 --> 17:17.960
You will succeed in erasing
the holiday as you wished.

17:18.460 --> 17:19.670
And what happens?

17:20.270 --> 17:25.310
<i> ♪ I see a cold wind</i>
<i> blowing through ♪</i>

17:27.380 --> 17:31.450
<i> ♪ I see days neither</i>
<i> fun nor free ♪</i>

17:33.520 --> 17:38.360
<i> ♪ I see a future</i>
<i> caused by you ♪</i>

17:40.230 --> 17:44.890
<i> ♪ I see a path not</i>
<i> meant to be ♪</i>

17:46.080 --> 17:51.780
<i> ♪ The future should</i>
<i> be filled with magic ♪</i>

17:52.350 --> 17:58.550
<i> ♪ dreams and wishes</i>
<i> brought to life ♪</i>

17:59.070 --> 18:05.320
<i> ♪ But the days ahead</i>
<i> are dark and tragic ♪</i>

18:06.120 --> 18:12.360
<i> ♪ no time for hope</i>
<i> when all is strife ♪</i>

18:12.870 --> 18:15.880
<i> ♪ Whatever might have been ♪</i>

18:16.110 --> 18:19.440
<i> ♪ all the dreams</i>
<i> that ponies share ♪</i>

18:19.560 --> 18:22.500
<i> ♪ Because of you,</i>
<i> Snowfall Frost ♪</i>

18:22.810 --> 18:26.610
<i> ♪ Now the future is</i>
<i> a cold nightmare ♪</i>

18:26.810 --> 18:28.680
WINDIGOS!? They
aren't real.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.530
It's just a little
filly's story!

18:30.770 --> 18:32.870
They are all too
real, Snowfall.

18:32.910 --> 18:35.530
And your actions will
allow them to return.

18:35.960 --> 18:38.970
The future of Equestria
shall be bathed in a blanket

18:39.020 --> 18:40.460
of eternal snow.

18:40.680 --> 18:44.440
No! I never meant for this to
happen. I didn't understand!

18:44.740 --> 18:47.580
I didn't see how important
Hearth's Warming Eve was!

18:47.940 --> 18:50.610
Please, spirit! I haven't
cast the spell yet!

18:50.920 --> 18:53.890
Is there still time?
I'm sorry!

19:04.960 --> 19:06.290
There's still time!

19:09.800 --> 19:10.580
Oh my.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.420
Snowfall Frost?

19:12.730 --> 19:14.810
I was hoping I wasn't
too late for the party.

19:14.940 --> 19:16.530
I brought gifts.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.750
Boss?

19:19.492 --> 19:22.493
I was wrong earlier. About
Hearth's Warming Eve.

19:22.700 --> 19:25.040
It's not all about
singing and presents.

19:25.380 --> 19:27.800
The singing and presents
are all about celebrating

19:27.860 --> 19:29.310
the ponies in our lives.

19:29.740 --> 19:33.790
The ponies we should listen
to more often. Our friends.

19:36.450 --> 19:37.470
Wow.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.060
Dragon toenail? Uh...thanks?

19:43.360 --> 19:46.560
I was in a hurry. I'll
do better next time.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.180
You kidding?

19:48.250 --> 19:50.700
No one's ever given me
dragon toenail before!

19:50.860 --> 19:53.410
It's awesome! Now
come get some eggnog!

19:53.910 --> 19:56.180
<i> And from then on it</i>

20:07.640 --> 20:09.300
Guess you can call
it a night.

heading downstairs.

20:12.310 --> 20:15.090

be welcome to join us.
