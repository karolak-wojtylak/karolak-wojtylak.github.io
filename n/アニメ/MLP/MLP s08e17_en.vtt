WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:09.208
Oh! Rarity! Just the
pony I'm looking for.

00:09.310 --> 00:12.077
Can you come to Twilight's class
with me? It won't take long.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.179
Oh, I'd love to help,

00:14.281 --> 00:17.149
but I have to meet Rainbow Dash
for our day of fun together.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.185
Twilight wants to use you as
an example for the students.

00:20.487 --> 00:21.220
Oooh!

00:22.256 --> 00:25.891
Your example is here!
Ha ha! Oh!

00:27.161 --> 00:29.595
I thought I was the example.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.864
You both are. Because together,
you perfectly demonstrate

00:32.966 --> 00:35.267
my lesson on compromise
in friendship!

00:35.369 --> 00:37.736
Rainbow Dash and Rarity have
very different interests

00:37.838 --> 00:41.106
that keep them busy. But being
friends is so important to them,

00:41.208 --> 00:43.742
they always manage to
make time for each other.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.878
Our Day of Fun was hard to plan,

00:47.080 --> 00:49.481
what with Rainbow Dash's
extremely time-consuming

00:49.583 --> 00:51.984
and erratically scheduled
Wonderbolts practice...

00:52.086 --> 00:54.686
And Rarity's<i> weird</i>
fashion seasons.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.588
She's working on her
winter collection

00:56.690 --> 00:58.624
and it's not even summer yet!

00:59.326 --> 01:01.360
But you still found
time to be together,

01:01.562 --> 01:03.095
and that's what counts!

01:03.197 --> 01:05.364
See, class? These
ponies are models

01:05.466 --> 01:07.399
of true friendship in action.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.504
Thanks for stopping by!
Enjoy your "Day of Fun"!

01:12.606 --> 01:16.442
Ooh, ooh! What amazing stuff
are you gonna do together?

01:16.944 --> 01:18.177
Shoe shopping!
Obstacle races!

01:18.579 --> 01:19.411
Dress shopping!

01:19.713 --> 01:20.946
Flight goggle shopping!

01:21.248 --> 01:24.984
Aw, come ON! I even said
<i> shopping</i> that time!

01:25.086 --> 01:27.252
Perfect! We'll go
shopping first.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.954
But, I brought
stuff for Buckball-

01:29.056 --> 01:31.190
Are we supposed to be
learning something here?

01:31.292 --> 01:33.993
Cause this doesn't sound
like compromising at all.

01:34.295 --> 01:38.897
Yeah! You guys have nothing in
common. How can you be friends?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.108
Even though Rainbow
Dash and Rarity

02:23.210 --> 02:24.743
enjoy doing different things,

02:24.845 --> 02:27.846
there are plenty of reasons
why they're friends.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.450
Uh, like what?

02:30.952 --> 02:33.585
Tch. We've <i>always</i> been friends!

02:33.987 --> 02:34.954
Always?

02:36.056 --> 02:40.125
Well, no. Not<i> always.</i> But
for like a super long time.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.562
And we know all
the same ponies.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.330
Um, is that it?

02:46.867 --> 02:50.001
There was that time during the
Cloudsdale Best Young Flyer

02:50.103 --> 02:53.272
competition when I totally saved
Rarity's life!

02:53.374 --> 02:56.908
Yes! And <i>I</i> once proved
Rainbow Dash's innocence

02:57.010 --> 02:58.443
to her beloved Wonderbolts

02:58.545 --> 03:01.446
when she was being framed
for a mysterious incident!

03:01.548 --> 03:03.783
Cool! What else?

03:05.294 --> 03:06.394
Heh heh..

03:06.919 --> 03:10.656
Uh, look, it may seem like
Rarity and Rainbow Dash

03:10.758 --> 03:12.157
don't have that
much in common

03:12.259 --> 03:14.026
when you try to put
it into words..

03:14.128 --> 03:18.096
But sometimes friendships
can't be explained.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.900
You just have to see them
in action to understand.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.002
Actually... that's
a great idea!

03:27.841 --> 03:30.876
Just go about your Day of
Fun as you normally would!

03:31.278 --> 03:33.011
You won't even know we're here!

03:33.213 --> 03:35.013
Game On!

03:43.857 --> 03:47.359
Rarity! You were supposed
to be holding your bucket!

03:47.461 --> 03:52.197
Hmm? Oh, sorry, darling! Wearing
this drab jersey gave me an idea

03:52.299 --> 03:55.167
for a Buckball-inspired
line of "athleisure wear"

03:55.269 --> 03:58.537
that would allow for maximum
flexibility and style.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.206
But I'm ready now!

04:01.108 --> 04:04.243
Good. Cause this time I'm
gonna try something new

04:04.345 --> 04:06.979
and super-intense!

04:15.989 --> 04:18.957
Rarity! Are you even
paying attention?

04:19.059 --> 04:22.962
What? Oh, I mean, of course! I
held my bucket and everything!

04:23.364 --> 04:26.099
But you have to
CATCH the ball.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.835
Really? Well, that
sounds dangerous.

04:31.738 --> 04:34.573
Oh, forget it. She's
never gonna understand

04:34.675 --> 04:36.141
the point of this game.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.843
Buckball time is over!

04:39.046 --> 04:40.579
Ah! Finally!

04:41.949 --> 04:45.117
Er.. see? They did something
Rainbow Dash likes,

04:45.219 --> 04:48.820
so now it's time for something
Rarity likes. Compromise!

04:50.557 --> 04:56.595
Hmmm. I'm genuinely not
sure. Are they too in style?

04:56.897 --> 04:59.765
Uh, isn't that what
you want them to be?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.801
Yes, yes. But they should
be ahead of the curve.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.403
If they're in
fashion right now,

05:04.505 --> 05:06.472
then they're
practically already out!

05:06.774 --> 05:08.207
That doesn't make any sense.

05:09.978 --> 05:12.611
Hmm. Perhaps I should get
the stilettos instead.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.045
What do you think?

05:14.782 --> 05:17.382
Unless you like tripping
with every step,

05:17.684 --> 05:20.386
heels on a horse
are pretty useless.

05:20.588 --> 05:24.923
[snort]<i> Au contraire!</i> They're perfect
in a multitude of situations:

05:25.025 --> 05:28.260
Formal functions, afternoon
teas, evening teas, high teas,

05:28.362 --> 05:29.561
tea by the sea, royal tea--

05:29.663 --> 05:33.432
Can they clean up glitter?
Ew! It's on my hooves!

05:35.235 --> 05:36.469
Are we done yet?

05:37.871 --> 05:38.738
Agh!

05:39.640 --> 05:43.108
This is <i>so</i> boring!

05:43.410 --> 05:45.911
Rainbow Dash and
Rarity are just... er..

05:46.013 --> 05:49.381
showcasing an aspect of
friendship called "banter":

05:49.483 --> 05:52.651
the playful and friendly
exchange of remarks!

05:52.953 --> 05:54.419
It's all in good fun!

05:57.525 --> 06:01.693
Ooh I cannot wait! Collecting
gemstones is my favorite.

06:02.395 --> 06:06.197
Finally, something we can
agree on: treasure hunting!

06:11.839 --> 06:14.372
See, everycreature?
That didn't take long.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.508
Now they're having a
great time together.

06:17.912 --> 06:21.747
Ooh<i> Magnifique!</i> This will
be perfect for the

06:21.849 --> 06:24.383
emerald-encrusted romper
I've been working on.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.918
Cool! Now what would
be even cooler

06:27.120 --> 06:29.287
is if we could find a treasure
chamber or something.

06:30.858 --> 06:35.094
Now if I were a secret
door, where would I be?

06:40.367 --> 06:44.469
Rainbow Dash! Could you please
refrain from all of that racket?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.438
It's muddying my
concentration.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.708
[gasp] Look! A lever!

06:52.245 --> 06:54.445
It's stuck. Come
help me, Rarity!

06:55.549 --> 06:56.948
[sigh] Just a moment.

07:04.025 --> 07:06.926
[gasp] You<i> ruined</i> my gems!

07:07.628 --> 07:10.795
Yeah, well. <i>You</i> ruined
my treasure hunt!

07:11.698 --> 07:13.799
Ugh. This wasn't about treasure!

07:13.901 --> 07:17.068
It was about finding gemstones
for my winter collection.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.187
Who cares about clothes!?

07:19.339 --> 07:21.807
We're supposed to be on
an adventure together!

07:23.043 --> 07:23.861
Uh oh.

07:23.962 --> 07:29.080
That. Is. It! This "Day of
Fun" is officially OVER!

07:29.383 --> 07:32.384
Fine by ME! Maybe I can spend
some time doing something

07:32.486 --> 07:34.519
I actually like now!

07:36.289 --> 07:37.489
Er.. heh heh heh.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.224
Surely you don't mean that!

07:39.326 --> 07:41.626
You're just having
a little.. disagreement!

07:41.828 --> 07:45.263
Sometimes that happens between
pals. But no matter what,

07:45.365 --> 07:48.667
they can always get past the
problem and stay good friends!

07:48.800 --> 07:50.233
I don't think we can.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.572
You don't care about any
of the things I like!

07:53.750 --> 07:56.984
It's always about you
and your boring fashions.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.912
Oh, Please!<i> You</i> don't even
give my interests a chance!

08:01.014 --> 08:03.615
You have absolutely no
respect for the finer things.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.751
NO RESPECT, I tell you!

08:06.253 --> 08:09.654
[both]
I guess we're just
NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE!

08:09.756 --> 08:10.622
Oh!

08:16.963 --> 08:19.230
And then there was the
time Rainbow Dash

08:19.332 --> 08:21.700
called my Cloudsdale
Couture Boutique idea

08:21.802 --> 08:24.269
"impractical"! Imagine that.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.637
Just because I'd
needed Twilight

08:25.739 --> 08:27.672
to perform the Butterfly
Wing spell on me

08:27.774 --> 08:29.975
whenever I wanted to
deliver merchandise.

08:30.477 --> 08:34.245
And I told her a thousand
times Pegasi don't even want

08:34.347 --> 08:38.817
restrictive, heavy dresses! We
need to be able to fly. Duh.

08:39.119 --> 08:43.054
Not to mention the day I was
wearing a<i> really</i> gorgeous hat

08:43.256 --> 08:46.325
and Rainbow Dash
didn't even notice!

08:46.927 --> 08:49.561
The Wonderbolts
show was RUINED!

08:49.663 --> 08:53.332
Rarity's hat was blocking
everypony's view!

08:54.568 --> 08:55.601
ENOUGH!

08:56.003 --> 08:58.637
Guidance counseling is for
talking out your problems,

08:58.739 --> 09:00.572
not telling me everything
that's ever happened

09:00.674 --> 09:02.240
in the history of Equestria!

09:04.377 --> 09:07.479
But I've learned sometimes
talking isn't enough.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.014
You need to put yourselves
in one another's shoes.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.719
No way am I wearing those.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.855
[groan]
What I'm saying is,

09:16.957 --> 09:21.593
we need a way to help you
two reconnect. Follow me!

09:27.834 --> 09:32.204
The library? And
this helps us how?

09:32.406 --> 09:34.239
You both love books!

09:34.341 --> 09:37.576
Rainbow Dash never
stops talking about
Daring Do adventures.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.279
And you're a huge fan of
Shadow Spade mysteries.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.180
Your point?

09:42.282 --> 09:45.150
The perfect way for you
two to reconnect as friends

09:45.252 --> 09:47.553
is to read each
other's favorite book.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.256
I'll read them, too! Then
we'll all discuss afterward.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.126
It'll be a "Good
Friends Book Club"! OK?

09:54.828 --> 09:55.961
I'll bring snacks..

09:56.663 --> 09:58.463
Ugh, fine.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.764
If you insist.

10:02.069 --> 10:05.770
Great! We're all here! To
start, why don't you two

10:05.872 --> 10:08.573
share one thing you liked
about each other's books?

10:12.713 --> 10:16.247
OK, I'll go first! Erm.. I
really enjoyed the part in

10:16.349 --> 10:18.617
"Daring Do and the
Razor of Dreams"

10:18.719 --> 10:21.586
when Daring used a vicious
Cragadile as a raft and then--

10:23.389 --> 10:24.289
Please!

10:24.591 --> 10:26.424
Uh, what's so funny?

10:26.526 --> 10:29.528
Uh sorry, it's just that I
find those action sequences

10:29.630 --> 10:32.030
so ridiculously
over-the-top.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.400
But they're real.. you've
even met Daring Do!

10:35.702 --> 10:38.837
Yes, but the book's
descriptions just drag on.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.407
And what about all those
silly, unpronounceable names?

10:42.509 --> 10:44.175
Doctor whozit, whatsit...

10:44.277 --> 10:45.711
Cab-a-YAIR-on?

10:46.413 --> 10:52.251
CAB-A-LER-ON! Just like it
looks! How hard is that?

10:53.153 --> 10:56.221
Uh tea, anypony?
Cucumber sandwich? Heh..

10:56.523 --> 11:00.159
Or we could go over some nice,
friendly talking points!

11:00.961 --> 11:04.295
Hah! Seriously? Don't
even get me started

11:04.397 --> 11:07.699
on those clothing
descriptions in Shadow Spade!

11:07.801 --> 11:10.068
What a yawn fest!

11:10.470 --> 11:13.938
B-But... the outfit
descriptions are an integral part of the plot

11:14.040 --> 11:17.576
of "The Colt in Crimson:
A Shadow Spade Mystery"!

11:21.948 --> 11:23.815
You see, if you
didn't know

11:23.917 --> 11:25.383
that Sir Fluffingsworth
von Radishfield

11:25.485 --> 11:27.919
wears only silk,
double-breasted waistcoats,

11:28.021 --> 11:31.223
you'd never deduce that
he, in fact, was the culprit!

11:31.725 --> 11:33.592
Wait, he was?

11:33.894 --> 11:37.596
[gasp] You didn't
even read it!

11:38.398 --> 11:40.232
I can see I'm gonna
need reinforcements.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.469
Not my fault it's so
boring it put me to sleep.

11:44.771 --> 11:47.572
If you can't be bothered
to read the thing I like,

11:47.674 --> 11:49.307
that just further
illustrates the point

11:49.409 --> 11:51.376
that we have nothing
in common anymore!

11:52.913 --> 11:55.914
At least we agree on
that! From now on,

11:56.016 --> 11:59.350
I'm only hanging out
with ponies who "get" me.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.756
Your drama can wait!
Twilight needs help, now!

12:09.930 --> 12:10.862
Any luck?

12:11.264 --> 12:13.965
No! It's GONE!

12:14.567 --> 12:15.600
What's gone?

12:15.902 --> 12:17.436
The Amulet of Aurora.

12:17.538 --> 12:19.804
Agh! One of the magical items
you've been keeping

12:19.906 --> 12:21.339
for Princess Celestia?

12:21.641 --> 12:25.009
That amulet can reverse the
tides and summon tsunamis!

12:25.111 --> 12:26.945
If it falls into the
wrong hooves,

12:27.147 --> 12:29.948
Equestria will be
in grave danger!

12:30.550 --> 12:31.750
Don't worry, Twilight!

12:31.851 --> 12:34.351
I know tons about searching
for lost treasure!

12:34.454 --> 12:36.087
And if I follow the
culprit's clues,

12:36.189 --> 12:38.489
I'm certain I can find
who took your amulet!

12:39.926 --> 12:41.860
Thank you! I'll
feel so much better

12:41.962 --> 12:45.130
knowing you two are
looking for it.. together!

12:46.299 --> 12:48.199
While WE work on
a locator spell!

12:48.301 --> 12:49.801
It's the perfect solution!

12:54.140 --> 12:56.307
There appear to be
no signs of damage

12:56.409 --> 12:58.309
to the surrounding
artifacts,

12:58.411 --> 13:01.679
suggesting the thief
did not leave in a hurry.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.688
RARITY! Your boots are leaving
sparkles all over the floor!

13:12.126 --> 13:18.997
Pfft. Those aren't from my
boots. Mine are magenta,
not blue. See?

13:22.068 --> 13:23.802
I mean, really!

13:30.944 --> 13:33.644
Turns out these boots were
not "made for trotting",

13:33.717 --> 13:35.051
as advertised.

13:35.275 --> 13:35.775
Uch!

13:37.252 --> 13:41.286
Where are you going?
We promised Twilight we'd work together!

13:41.788 --> 13:42.987
Don't you see?

13:43.089 --> 13:46.391
The Amulet of Aurora is
made out of Azurantium!

13:48.929 --> 13:51.562
Azurantium? You know,
the same metal

13:51.664 --> 13:52.897
that the Amulet of Atonement

13:52.999 --> 13:54.899
from Daring Do Book
4 is made from?

13:55.001 --> 13:57.435
It always leaves sparkles
wherever it goes!

13:57.537 --> 14:01.673
Just like this. Remember? It's
from the book you JUST READ?

14:02.075 --> 14:08.313
[nervous chuckle]
That book yes. The one I - I just read. Heh.

14:09.816 --> 14:13.184
Seriously? After giving
me all that grief,

14:13.386 --> 14:15.487
you didn't read
mine either!?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.056
Oopsie?

14:17.658 --> 14:22.326
Grrr. As soon as we find this
amulet, we are DONE with each other!

14:23.563 --> 14:25.430
Fine by me!

14:35.985 --> 14:36.485
Oooh!

14:36.710 --> 14:41.480
Rainbow Dash, slow down!
You're flying past important clues!

14:42.082 --> 14:44.549
It's a print, but
definitely not a hoof.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.351
Are those claw marks?

14:46.653 --> 14:49.554
Who cares? I found
a bigger clue.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.493
I hope you don't
expect me to...

14:55.595 --> 14:58.163
[shudder] WADE through that.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.273
Nah, it's too deep.
We'll get stuck.

15:07.875 --> 15:11.676
Ooh clever! What Daring Do book
did you get that from?

15:11.778 --> 15:14.345
Actually, I learned it at
Scootaloo's Filly Guides camp.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.949
Ach. At least you can fly across...

15:23.490 --> 15:26.591
Nope! If one of those geysers
burns off my wingfeathers,

15:26.750 --> 15:28.985
I'll be out of the
Wonderbolts for weeks.

15:29.130 --> 15:33.364
[sigh] I could try and
slingshot my way through,

15:33.566 --> 15:35.433
but I'd need two
perfectly placed trees,

15:35.535 --> 15:37.835
some stretchy rope,
and a pith helmet.

15:38.159 --> 15:39.038
Hm..

15:39.539 --> 15:41.539
Too bad we can't
do what Daring Do did

15:41.641 --> 15:44.609
in book 4 and find a
Cragadile for a raft.

15:44.711 --> 15:49.280
Ta da! The SS Cragadile,
at your service.

15:50.350 --> 15:54.052
Uh. That. Is... Awesome!

15:54.254 --> 15:57.388
I-I mean... it's all
right. I guess.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.560
How did you know
how to do that?

16:01.662 --> 16:04.996
Hm! We may have been friends
"for a super long time",

16:05.198 --> 16:07.565
but you don't know
EVERYTHING about me yet!

16:17.844 --> 16:20.345
[gasp] The glitter trail! It's gone!

16:20.647 --> 16:23.915
How are we supposed to find
the Amulet of Aurora now!?

16:31.224 --> 16:36.294
[very quietly] Ow, ears!
Why hoof-hoofs yell?

16:36.396 --> 16:38.930
Too-too loud.

16:39.933 --> 16:42.334
Sorry, what did you say?

16:42.736 --> 16:46.004
Too-too loud.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.975
I think it's a Bufogren! They
have really sensitive ears.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.443
[whispering] Did you happen to
see anycreature

16:52.545 --> 16:55.080
with a sparkly
thingy go this way?

16:55.882 --> 16:57.215
Saw it.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.251
Gah!

16:59.853 --> 17:00.918
Hold that thought.

17:06.559 --> 17:10.161
His breath smells so
bad I can't think!

17:10.263 --> 17:14.465
But we can't hear him
from back here. Now what?

17:14.567 --> 17:15.401
Hmm.

17:20.273 --> 17:24.275
Aha! I think I have
the perfect solution.

17:24.377 --> 17:28.246
An old unicorn beauty trick.
That is, if you can somehow

17:28.348 --> 17:30.048
procure us a tiny
bit of cloud?

17:30.150 --> 17:31.782
Now that! I can do!

17:37.691 --> 17:40.091
Oooh! It's adorable!

17:46.733 --> 17:49.067
[nasal] Uh. Excuse me, kind sir.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.502
I have a special
treat for you

17:51.704 --> 17:53.938
in exchange
for your information.

17:54.876 --> 17:58.010
Uhm. What's that?

17:59.312 --> 18:02.413
It is a magical
Unicorn delicacy

18:02.615 --> 18:04.282
called "Effervescence".

18:04.384 --> 18:06.851
Very now, very chic.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.687
Ooow!

18:09.789 --> 18:11.789
Sorry. Sorry. Enjoy!

18:12.394 --> 18:18.763
Mmmmm. Mm.
Muh mouth. Fresh and minty.

18:21.301 --> 18:28.073
Ah! Good! Now which way did
the sparkly thing go?

18:28.475 --> 18:31.443
Up-up! Up there.

18:31.845 --> 18:32.844
Thank you!

18:34.781 --> 18:37.281
Well, what are you
waiting for? Go on!

18:37.383 --> 18:39.285
Fly up there and
get that amulet!

18:39.887 --> 18:43.087
Uh.. we're doing this
together, remember?

18:43.189 --> 18:44.889
But how can we? Oh!

18:49.662 --> 18:53.064
Sorry, but I wasn't leaving
you behind in that swamp.

18:53.367 --> 18:55.434
[gasp] Thank you.

19:01.675 --> 19:04.542
Huh... maybe the key to
unlocking this thing

19:04.744 --> 19:06.911
is in these inscriptions.

19:07.013 --> 19:10.214
Or.. perhaps the
key is right here!

19:13.053 --> 19:15.319
I couldn't decide between
the boots and the stilettos,

19:15.421 --> 19:16.421
so I got both.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.734
High heels can
do that!?

19:21.895 --> 19:23.795
And you called
them useless..

19:24.797 --> 19:27.698
I shouldn't have said that. Or
made fun of the other stuff

19:27.800 --> 19:31.269
you like to do. Some of
it's actually sorta neat.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.572
I owe you an apology, too.

19:34.674 --> 19:38.843
Buckball may not be my thing,
but it's something you enjoy.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.745
And you're very good at it!

19:41.147 --> 19:42.713
I never should have
treated your interests

19:42.815 --> 19:44.716
like they were worth
less than mine.

19:45.418 --> 19:49.154
So... does this mean
we're still friends?

19:49.556 --> 19:51.590
I would very
much like that.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.692
Now let's go find
that amulet!

19:54.994 --> 19:56.627
Yeah! Ha ha!

20:00.099 --> 20:03.668
Wait. That tunnel
leads to the SCHOOL?

20:03.970 --> 20:07.071
A secret passage!
AWESOME!

20:08.308 --> 20:13.478
[gasp] Spikey-Wikey, you
stole the Amulet of Aurora!?

20:13.680 --> 20:15.580
Twilight: Not exactly.

20:17.684 --> 20:22.320
You mean... this was a
setup to make us get along?

20:22.422 --> 20:25.656
Sorry to interfere,
but you both--

20:25.958 --> 20:28.326
Reaaally needed it.

20:31.798 --> 20:35.199
So even though you don't like
any of the same stuff,

20:35.301 --> 20:37.102
you two are friends again?

20:37.404 --> 20:42.607
Heh. Always. I think we just
needed a teensy reminder.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.776
Yeah. We don't have to
love the exact same things

20:45.878 --> 20:49.147
to have fun together. I
mean, imagine if we did!

20:49.349 --> 20:51.349
How boring would that be?

20:51.751 --> 20:54.285
When we give each other
a chance to share the
different things

20:54.387 --> 20:57.823
we enjoy, it can be
surprisingly wonderful!

20:58.325 --> 21:01.326
Ah. Too bad we wasted
our Day of Fun.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.327
We still have a
little time left!

21:03.529 --> 21:05.563
You wanna... go hit the shops?

21:05.665 --> 21:06.731
I could actually
use your help

21:06.833 --> 21:08.566
picking out some
new Buckball gear!

21:08.668 --> 21:09.567
DO I?

21:09.969 --> 21:13.571
But... only if you help me choose
some Buckball fan attire,

21:13.773 --> 21:15.573
so I can cheer for
my favorite player

21:15.675 --> 21:17.608
at the drop of a fabulous hat.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.444
Uh, YEAH! Let's go already!

21:22.949 --> 21:26.885
See? Good friends always work
through their differences.

21:26.987 --> 21:30.354
[chuckle] Even if it takes
a little help.
