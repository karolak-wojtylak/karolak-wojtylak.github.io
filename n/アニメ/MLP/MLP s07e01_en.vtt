WEBVTT

00:04.848 --> 00:06.064
Hey Spike. What's up?

00:06.492 --> 00:08.300
Just, uh, wanted to
make sure you're ready

00:08.324 --> 00:09.464
for your big
ceremony today.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.656
Yup. Wow, I still can't
believe my friends and I

00:13.672 --> 00:15.636
are getting medals of honor.

00:16.476 --> 00:19.344
Are you kidding? You
totally deserve it!

00:19.596 --> 00:25.348
After all, you saved Equestria
from Queen Chrysalis

00:25.536 --> 00:29.336
with the help of Trixie
and Thorax and Discord.

00:29.488 --> 00:33.288
Uh, yeah. I know what
happened. I was kinda there?

00:33.664 --> 00:37.556
Oh, right. Uh, so
what are you wearing?

00:38.352 --> 00:41.736
Not sure. Why? Am I
supposed to dress up?

00:41.976 --> 00:45.676
No. I mean, you could. It's
like Rarity always says:

00:46.480 --> 00:49.352
"There's no such thing
as overdressed darling.

00:49.452 --> 00:51.908
You're just the best-looking
pony in the room!"

00:54.864 --> 00:56.356
What are you
looking at?

00:56.668 --> 00:57.572
No, don't look!

01:00.116 --> 01:04.468
Cuz there was a spider there
but it's gone now so...

01:04.992 --> 01:05.724
Thanks, Starlight!
Bye!

01:11.724 --> 01:15.996
Heh heh. She had no idea.
We're a good team, Sparkle.

01:16.440 --> 01:21.408
Sparkle? Yeah we are.
So, do you think she'll like it?

01:21.760 --> 01:25.216
I want this present to
say "I'm so proud of you,

01:25.316 --> 01:27.540
both as a mentor
and a friend.

01:27.744 --> 01:30.476
Equestria is safer
thanks to you."

01:30.996 --> 01:34.104
Oh. I thought you were getting
her a mirror, like yours.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.008
I am.

01:36.468 --> 01:37.868
Maybe you should
get her a card,

01:37.924 --> 01:39.944
cause I don't think the
mirror will say all that.

01:40.044 --> 01:41.336
But I think
she'll like it.

01:41.584 --> 01:43.260
It's just what
her room needs.

01:43.488 --> 01:45.816
The first thing she'll see
when she wakes up is herself

01:45.852 --> 01:47.416
surrounded by all her friends!

01:47.696 --> 01:49.900
I plan on giving it to
her after the ceremony.

01:50.170 --> 01:51.424
Yeah, about that.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.868
Don't you need to get the castle
ready for the celebration?

01:54.360 --> 01:56.436
Nah. Pinkie Pie's
got that covered.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.132
Hm.

02:08.362 --> 02:13.360

By YayPonies
Hey look! it's NEW PONY SEASON TIME!
https://yp1.yayponies.eu

02:40.928 --> 02:44.492
Starlight, Trixie,
Thorax and Discord

02:44.544 --> 02:46.444
were brave in the
face of danger,

02:46.808 --> 02:48.832
resourceful when
things got challenging

02:48.972 --> 02:50.964
and proved that the
bonds of friendship,

02:51.036 --> 02:54.916
no matter how unlikely, are
stronger than any adversity.

02:55.572 --> 02:57.140
By stopping
Queen Chrysalis,

02:57.340 --> 02:59.464
not only did they
save Equestria,

02:59.576 --> 03:02.192
they set the changelings
free from her reign.

03:02.776 --> 03:06.912
Go Discord! Yahoo!

03:08.844 --> 03:12.440
And that's why we're proud
and honored to give them

03:12.464 --> 03:15.584
the Equestrian Pink
Hearts of Courage.

03:28.956 --> 03:33.192
Yeah! Oh! Not quite!

03:34.900 --> 03:38.716
All right! There it is.
YAAAAAAY!

03:41.392 --> 03:43.328
We are so proud of you all.

03:55.832 --> 03:59.460
It was the Great and
Powerful Trixie's pleasure

03:59.620 --> 04:02.296
to save you from
your imminent doom.

04:02.416 --> 04:06.324
Yes. Because you did
it all by yourself.

04:07.196 --> 04:09.888
I can't believe you managed
to do it without magic.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.508
It was amazing!

04:11.640 --> 04:14.168
No one's ever stood up
to Chrysalis like that.

04:14.492 --> 04:18.684
Oh, I just did what
anypony would've done.

04:19.156 --> 04:20.996
It's a wonderful
feeling, isn't it?

04:21.044 --> 04:22.624
Watching your
student shine

04:22.644 --> 04:24.796
the way you always
knew they could.

04:25.996 --> 04:27.436
My cheeks are sore.

04:27.728 --> 04:30.336
I don't think I've ever
smiled this much in my life.

04:30.544 --> 04:33.440
I can only imagine
what that feels like.

04:36.032 --> 04:39.264
Yes, Starlight is student
of the year, isn't she?

04:39.360 --> 04:41.040
She has so much
potential.

04:41.176 --> 04:43.120
So, what are we going
to do with her?

04:43.268 --> 04:46.028
And by "we" I
definitely mean you.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.924
Being her mentor
and all that,

04:48.096 --> 04:51.528
her destiny falls
squarely on your haunches.

04:53.332 --> 04:54.496
Oh, don't you worry.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.400
I've planned enough
friendship lessons

04:56.424 --> 04:58.132
to cover the next
three years.

05:01.016 --> 05:01.672
What's so funny?

05:01.708 --> 05:03.212
No, no.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.492
Clearly Starlight is beyond
basic friendship lessons.

05:06.672 --> 05:09.768
She just won a medal,
for Equestria's sake!

05:09.936 --> 05:14.116
I thought you were joking.
You are joking, right?

05:14.264 --> 05:16.884
Of course I was.

05:17.508 --> 05:20.796
Obviously you should have a
grand master plan for her,

05:20.948 --> 05:24.260
the same way Celestia
set you on a path

05:24.340 --> 05:27.728
that eventually
made you a princess.

05:28.128 --> 05:28.780
Yup.

05:29.372 --> 05:35.560
Oh, good. I'm sure she can't
wait to hear all about it!

05:38.004 --> 05:41.352
So how's the whole
ruling-a-kingdom thing going?

05:41.596 --> 05:45.068
It's a bit... overwhelming.
But we're adjusting.

05:46.036 --> 05:48.964
So you can't have friendship
without makeovers?

05:49.960 --> 05:51.324
Not exactly.

05:52.740 --> 05:54.344
Oh, Starlight!

05:54.464 --> 05:57.176
Princess Twilight has something
very important to tell us.

05:57.328 --> 06:01.444
Well, just you really, but
I'm nosey and I want to hear.

06:01.888 --> 06:04.280
OK. Would you
excuse me?

06:06.084 --> 06:06.976
Never mind.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.396
What's going on?

06:08.504 --> 06:11.144
Well, Twilight was
just about to reveal

06:11.180 --> 06:13.996
her grand master
plan for you.

06:14.228 --> 06:16.152
Really? I was kind
of wondering

06:16.192 --> 06:17.372
what we were going
to do next.

06:17.504 --> 06:20.728
Yes, I'd say we were
both fairly interested.

06:21.928 --> 06:26.304
Of course you are. And I
do have a plan, obviously,

06:26.508 --> 06:28.540
but now's clearly not
the time to do it.

06:28.580 --> 06:29.960
You should enjoy your party.

06:30.780 --> 06:32.004
Starlight, come on!

06:32.036 --> 06:34.216
The Ponyville Chronicle
wants to take our picture!

06:34.872 --> 06:37.228
Ugh. You too,
Discord.

06:40.276 --> 06:43.012
PSST. I see what you're doing.

06:43.432 --> 06:44.092
You do?

06:44.548 --> 06:47.464
You already planned
the perfect moment

06:47.548 --> 06:50.044
during the party to make
the grand announcement

06:50.080 --> 06:52.624
to everypony
about your plan!

06:53.948 --> 06:55.280
Brava, Twilight.

06:55.328 --> 06:57.640
I can't wait to tell
Fluttershy and the others!

06:58.068 --> 06:59.120
Discord, no.

07:03.868 --> 07:07.104
Twilight? Are you reading
during a party again?

07:07.572 --> 07:09.640
No, no, no. She's
already good at that.

07:09.716 --> 07:12.932
She mastered this. She
taught me about this one!

07:13.336 --> 07:15.352
Wild guess: something's wrong.

07:15.416 --> 07:17.732
Spike, I'm a terrible mentor.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.200
Why didn't I come up with
a path for Starlight?

07:20.412 --> 07:22.936
Princess Celestia had it
all figured out for me.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.784
That's it!

07:28.380 --> 07:30.260
I had years' worth
of friendship lessons

07:30.296 --> 07:31.052
ready to go,

07:31.296 --> 07:33.044
but when we were
captured by Chrysalis,

07:33.188 --> 07:35.452
Starlight took charge
and really stepped up.

07:35.852 --> 07:37.184
I don't think
friendship lessons

07:37.212 --> 07:38.732
are enough for
her anymore.

07:39.212 --> 07:43.076
So you have an overachieving
student? Sounds familiar.

07:44.340 --> 07:45.992
That's why I had
to talk to you.

07:46.168 --> 07:48.208
You of all ponies
would know what to do.

07:48.352 --> 07:50.784
I mean, you were me
and I was Starlight.

07:51.024 --> 07:53.608
But for now, I need you to
pretend you're you and I'm me.

07:53.828 --> 07:54.456
Huh?

07:55.156 --> 07:55.992
Go on.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.560
When I was your student
and you were in this place,

07:58.692 --> 08:02.812
you... oh no. You
sent me to Ponyville.

08:03.124 --> 08:04.444
Which means, it's
time for me

08:04.468 --> 08:06.228
to send Starlight
Glimmer away!

08:10.164 --> 08:11.424
I can't believe it.

08:11.568 --> 08:14.656
It really is time for
Starlight to go, isn't it?

08:15.160 --> 08:17.456
Only you can make
that decision.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.088
It's a difficult one, but your
heart knows what's right.

08:21.304 --> 08:22.984
Even as it hurts.

08:23.620 --> 08:24.624
Where are you going
to send her?

08:26.836 --> 08:27.376
Too soon?

08:28.500 --> 08:30.944
No. This is something
I have to do.

08:34.504 --> 08:35.436
Oh, boy.

08:35.644 --> 08:36.948
Oh, boy?

08:37.532 --> 08:39.312
Whatever Twilight's
planning for Starlight

08:39.352 --> 08:41.560
is going to be
so exciting!

08:41.816 --> 08:44.864
Hm. Wonder why she didn't
tell any of us about it?

08:45.236 --> 08:48.056
Probably because you're not as
close as you think you are.

08:50.052 --> 08:53.500
Just kidding. She wanted
it to be a big surprise.

08:53.644 --> 08:55.808
Just between us,
she's getting ready

08:55.848 --> 08:58.052
to make a big
announcement!

08:58.248 --> 09:00.760
Eeeee. That's so
exciting! And surprising.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.180
Usually you tell
your party planner

09:02.212 --> 09:03.764
about all your plans
for your party.

09:03.856 --> 09:05.508
Well, she definitely has one.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.680
I mean when has
Twilight not had a plan?

09:10.750 --> 09:14.700
Hm, gosh, I don't know.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.744
I GOT IT!
Since defeating Chrysalis,

09:17.784 --> 09:19.064
Starlight's given
the changelings

09:19.108 --> 09:21.488
an opportunity to
revolutionize their society.

09:21.744 --> 09:23.152
Maybe I can send her there.

09:29.924 --> 09:30.956
Cool spell.

09:31.484 --> 09:33.272
If Starlight goes to
the changeling hive,

09:33.408 --> 09:35.628
she can help them adjust
to their new way of life.

09:36.156 --> 09:38.164
OK, friendship one-oh-one:

09:38.610 --> 09:41.332
Thorax and I are going to
show you how to compromise.

09:41.610 --> 09:45.112
I want to have honeysuckle
nectar for lunch.

09:45.472 --> 09:49.544
I would like a sandwich.
Oh, no. What should we do?

09:49.788 --> 09:52.860
Attack! The winner
gets to choose!

09:55.520 --> 09:59.872
OR, Thorax and I can
talk about it and come up

09:59.900 --> 10:01.772
with a solution that
works for everypony.

10:02.396 --> 10:04.936
Starlight. How do
you feel about

10:04.964 --> 10:08.056
honeysuckle and peanut
butter sandwiches?

10:08.340 --> 10:11.284
Why, that sounds
delicious.

10:11.536 --> 10:13.444
Compromise!

10:17.708 --> 10:19.776
Um, this doesn't
seem like something

10:19.800 --> 10:21.368
Starlight and
Thorax would do.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.980
Uh, this is Twilight's
fantasy, Spike.

10:24.176 --> 10:26.384
There is no wrong
way to fantasize.

10:26.576 --> 10:27.488
Thank you.

10:27.616 --> 10:31.712
Starlight Glimmer is a most
apt and perspicacious pony!

10:32.036 --> 10:34.452
Yep, definitely a
Twilight fantasy.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.902
This seems like a lovely
path for Starlight.

10:38.024 --> 10:39.728
The Changelings have
so much to learn

10:39.752 --> 10:42.368
about how to enjoy love
through friendships.

10:42.660 --> 10:45.232
Starlight would be busy
for a very long time,

10:45.540 --> 10:48.808
but her work there
would be very rewarding.

10:50.360 --> 10:53.116
Or dangerous. It would
only take one Changeling

10:53.140 --> 10:54.540
to deviate from the pack.

11:03.564 --> 11:07.684
Hi, I'm Starlight Glimmer.
What's your name?

11:07.944 --> 11:09.524
Uh, Cornicle?

11:09.900 --> 11:13.404
PFFFT! HA! What kind
of name is that?

11:14.344 --> 11:19.364
Your wings are so
um, see-through.

11:19.700 --> 11:25.384
I'm so glad I'm a pony.
Are you like bugs or what?

11:31.228 --> 11:32.820
There she is! Get her!

11:36.920 --> 11:39.596
Um, that probably
won't happen.

11:39.876 --> 11:42.516
But it could. I can't
just send her off to

11:42.548 --> 11:44.892
Celestia-knows-where without
thinking it through!

11:45.105 --> 11:47.939
Huh. I was not aware
that I was an expression.

11:48.060 --> 11:49.856
An appropriate one, of course,

11:50.056 --> 11:51.964
for even I don't
know the answer.

11:52.168 --> 11:54.340
This is a momentous
decision.

11:54.504 --> 11:56.924
You must consider all
the possibilities.

11:57.244 --> 11:58.788
Rethink, rethink, rethink...

12:00.860 --> 12:01.884
What about the dragons?

12:02.172 --> 12:04.076
I can send Starlight
to the Dragon Lands.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.072
She and Ember would
totally hit it off!

12:11.084 --> 12:12.936
Emberrrr!

12:13.332 --> 12:15.008
Starliiiiight!

12:17.296 --> 12:19.820
You ready to do some
death-defying dragon stuff?

12:20.340 --> 12:21.568
Totally.

12:21.948 --> 12:23.772
OK, that doesn't sound anything

12:23.792 --> 12:25.608
like Ember or Starlight.

12:25.768 --> 12:27.940
Who knows what their
dynamic would be, Spike?

12:40.816 --> 12:41.376
Freaky.

12:42.444 --> 12:44.772
Starlight will love it
in the dragon lands.

12:45.044 --> 12:47.320
In her letters, Ember
said dragons do a lot

12:47.340 --> 12:50.372
of fun things: The Feast
of Fires, the Dragon Bowl,

12:50.424 --> 12:51.620
Clawchella...

12:53.100 --> 12:56.028
Starlight could be there
for a really long time.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.360
But then again, not
all dragons like ponies

12:59.388 --> 13:01.084
as much as Ember does.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.668
Hey, Twinkle Star!

13:03.928 --> 13:05.700
It's uh, Starlight Glimmer.

13:05.972 --> 13:08.152
Star-kle Light-star?

13:08.424 --> 13:10.028
Starlight Glimmer.

13:10.192 --> 13:11.764
Yeah Whatever. You
wanna hang with us?

13:13.596 --> 13:15.112
What are we diving into?

13:15.408 --> 13:16.948
Lava!

13:17.060 --> 13:17.824
WHAT?!

13:19.172 --> 13:20.988
Twilight, this is crazy!

13:23.292 --> 13:24.864
Starlight's really
good with magic.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.532
She could just stop
herself from falling

13:26.552 --> 13:27.644
into a pit of lava.

13:27.956 --> 13:30.848
What if she didn't
realize it was happening?

13:31.116 --> 13:32.628
You just never know, Spike!

13:32.788 --> 13:34.944
I just need to think of
someplace safe to send her.

13:35.244 --> 13:36.848
Some place safe, some place
safe. Some place safe.

13:38.332 --> 13:39.944
I could send her to
the Crystal Empire

13:39.980 --> 13:42.344
to continue her magical
studies with Sunburst!

13:47.288 --> 13:48.328
It'll be perfect!

13:48.590 --> 13:50.748
Sunburst's knowledge of
magic is only matched

13:50.788 --> 13:52.040
by Starlight's abilities.

13:53.340 --> 13:57.080
I've got it! Try placing your
horn directly on the potion

13:57.152 --> 13:58.840
and picture the clock
you wish to make.

14:04.312 --> 14:05.872
They could challenge
each other into becoming

14:05.904 --> 14:08.472
the most talented unicorns
Equestria's ever seen!

14:08.640 --> 14:10.760
We did it! Quick,
what's next?

14:12.112 --> 14:15.488
Of course, the study of
magic is a lifelong pursuit

14:15.512 --> 14:17.516
and Starlight could
be there for a while,

14:17.540 --> 14:18.900
especially once they
start attempting

14:18.928 --> 14:20.720
the really complicated stuff!

14:21.084 --> 14:23.764
Three... two... one...

14:24.100 --> 14:26.052
What if they become
too ambitious?

14:27.292 --> 14:29.300
I never would have thought
to combine Starswirl's

14:29.336 --> 14:31.560
apparition spell with
spatium flexibus!

14:31.960 --> 14:33.652
But what would
happen if we added

14:33.672 --> 14:35.736
Sonambula's tempus
objectus?

14:36.032 --> 14:38.212
If we do it just right,
it should allow us

14:38.236 --> 14:41.076
to materialize an object
that was lost in the past!

14:50.120 --> 14:51.600
No, don't do it.

15:01.460 --> 15:04.600
Starlight! NOOOO!

15:05.912 --> 15:08.096
Twilight! Snap out of it!

15:10.944 --> 15:13.232
Easy, Twilight.
It didn't happen.

15:13.332 --> 15:14.588
But it could.

15:15.432 --> 15:17.508
I just don't think I
can send her anywhere.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.580
What am I going to do?

15:25.536 --> 15:26.772
Are you laughing at me?

15:33.156 --> 15:35.552
I can't believe
you're laughing at me.

15:36.288 --> 15:39.576
Oh, Twilight, I'm not.
I'm laughing because

15:39.596 --> 15:41.884
I had the exact same
fears you're having.

15:42.040 --> 15:42.712
What?

15:43.212 --> 15:44.728
Let me tell you a story.

15:45.376 --> 15:48.880
Once upon a time there was
a very bright young filly.

15:49.524 --> 15:52.028
She was truly one
of my best students.

15:52.488 --> 15:54.264
Are you talking about Twilight?

15:54.576 --> 15:56.164
I can't see what
you're thinking about.

15:57.072 --> 15:58.152
Yes, Spike.

16:04.990 --> 16:07.716
I was constantly
surprised and impressed

16:07.820 --> 16:08.612
with her discoveries.

16:12.312 --> 16:14.872
But I noticed that her
pursuit of academia

16:14.940 --> 16:17.532
was preventing her from
reaching her full potential.

16:17.732 --> 16:20.284
You mean it was keeping
her isolated and alone?

16:20.468 --> 16:21.800
Uh. Yes, Spike.

16:22.320 --> 16:26.864
I had a decision to
make. But it wasn't easy.

16:28.712 --> 16:30.520
Maybe I could close the library

16:30.560 --> 16:32.776
or throw a party in the castle?

16:33.172 --> 16:35.640
She'd have to talk to
the other fillies then.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.144
I must send her away!

16:42.868 --> 16:46.132
I knew there was a special
group of fillies in Ponyville,

16:46.516 --> 16:48.796
but I kept inventing
all kinds of reasons

16:48.860 --> 16:50.360
why I shouldn't send you.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.388
What if she runs into a
manticore? Or what if

16:54.408 --> 16:57.264
she gets pulled into
Tartarus? Or worst of all,

16:57.300 --> 16:59.352
what if she doesn't
get along with anypony?

17:00.096 --> 17:01.236
Are we supposed
to say something?

17:01.380 --> 17:02.572
I don't think so.

17:03.972 --> 17:07.028
I kept you in Canterlot
longer than I should have.

17:08.676 --> 17:11.544
Eventually, I realized
all the anxiety I felt

17:11.692 --> 17:14.240
was because I didn't
want you to go.

17:14.572 --> 17:15.528
Really?

17:15.852 --> 17:18.184
I loved having you
as a student.

17:18.444 --> 17:20.932
You challenged me and
taught me just as much

17:20.960 --> 17:22.252
as I taught you.

17:22.624 --> 17:25.668
I am embarrassed to admit
it, but I was afraid

17:25.684 --> 17:29.148
if you made friends, you
wouldn't need me anymore.

17:30.812 --> 17:33.744
Princess Celestia,
that is so not true.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.860
I will always need you.

17:36.136 --> 17:38.576
I think Starlight Glimmer
might feel the same way

17:38.600 --> 17:41.196
about you, if that is
what you're afraid of.

17:41.412 --> 17:43.268
Maybe it is.
Just a little.

17:43.544 --> 17:46.512
Oh, it definitely
is. Like a lot.

17:47.676 --> 17:50.724
Here we are after all
these years, Twilight.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.504
We are living proof
that letting someone

17:53.532 --> 17:56.392
spread their wings doesn't
mean you no longer have

17:56.436 --> 17:58.236
a place in their lives.

17:58.628 --> 17:59.352
Thank you.

17:59.540 --> 18:00.956
And if you're still worried,

18:01.340 --> 18:03.300
you can always make
her write you letters!

18:13.120 --> 18:15.668
I may have let it slip
that you'd be unveiling

18:15.692 --> 18:19.168
your big plan for Starlight
tonight. Silly me.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.324
But we're all very excited to
hear what you've cooked up.

18:26.520 --> 18:30.276
You weren't coming up with
a plan just now, were you?

18:30.456 --> 18:35.028
Oh, dear. This could be
pretty embarrassing for you.

18:35.516 --> 18:37.332
Gee, thanks Discord.

18:37.436 --> 18:40.168
Anytime. I really do
love being helpful.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.624
If I could have
everypony's attention.

18:46.288 --> 18:49.120
As you all know, Starlight
Glimmer has been my pupil

18:49.148 --> 18:52.232
for a while now and I'd
hoped she'd be my pupil

18:52.272 --> 18:55.316
for a long time yet to
come, but it turns out

18:55.480 --> 18:57.268
that's just not meant to be.

18:58.912 --> 19:02.008
Starlight, you have proved
yourself to be a kind,

19:02.292 --> 19:06.448
loyal, strong, honest
and truly magical friend.

19:06.808 --> 19:08.320
Just looking around
this room at

19:08.388 --> 19:09.936
all the new friendships
you've made,

19:09.972 --> 19:12.244
I know there's nothing
more I need to teach you.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.672
So we have a second
reason to celebrate today.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.752
Three cheers for
Starlight Glimmer

19:17.788 --> 19:19.516
on her "graduation" day!

19:21.796 --> 19:24.992
EEE WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE!!

19:25.584 --> 19:27.684
Your future is in
your own hooves now.

19:28.236 --> 19:30.908
Wow. I was not expecting this.

19:33.268 --> 19:35.916
Darn it. I was hoping you'd
send her to my realm.

19:35.996 --> 19:37.192
We could have been roomies!

19:37.304 --> 19:39.992
Way to not pick up what
I was putting down.

19:41.328 --> 19:44.208
How do you wanna celebrate?
Girls trip to Las Pegasus?

19:44.512 --> 19:46.888
We can throw you a
changeling Gorbfest!

19:47.360 --> 19:49.292
Uh, it's more fun
than it sounds.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.652
Or we could go cause
a little mischief.

19:54.024 --> 19:58.400
I know a trick that'll turn
Celestia's castle into cheese.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.536
Do you think it's
a gouda idea? Ha!

20:02.040 --> 20:04.056
That's just the first
of many cheese jokes

20:04.152 --> 20:05.568
if we go down this path.

20:06.340 --> 20:09.656
That all sounds
wonderful but um...

20:09.868 --> 20:11.132
Give me a minute, would ya?

20:13.752 --> 20:15.396
Congratulations!

20:15.600 --> 20:16.392
Thanks!

20:16.844 --> 20:18.556
So, how do you feel?

20:18.904 --> 20:21.668
Happy, surprised, overwhelmed...

20:21.896 --> 20:26.112
I mean, not that I'm not
grateful but are you sure?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.580
Believe me, I've thought
long and hard about this.

20:31.680 --> 20:32.800
Of course you did.

20:33.288 --> 20:36.152
Starlight, trust
me. You're ready.

20:36.484 --> 20:37.484
Yeah.

20:39.216 --> 20:40.228
No, I'm not.

20:40.472 --> 20:41.716
What are you
talking about?

20:42.076 --> 20:43.500
I'm not ready to leave!

20:44.120 --> 20:46.528
Oh, good! Cuz I'm not
ready for that either!

20:46.608 --> 20:48.984
Here. I got you
this present.

20:52.036 --> 20:52.920
It was going to be a

20:52.948 --> 20:54.816
'congrats on getting a
medal of honor present',

20:54.852 --> 20:56.152
but then I was afraid
it would have to be a

20:56.180 --> 20:57.592
'going away' present
but now it's a

20:57.624 --> 20:59.308
'I couldn't be happier
you're staying' present!

20:59.988 --> 21:03.204
It fits perfectly over your
dresser. I know. I measured!

21:04.284 --> 21:05.284
Thank you.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.556
I may not know what
comes next for you,

21:07.768 --> 21:11.436
but whatever it is, I promise
I'll always be there for you.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.892
Ohhh!

21:31.160 --> 21:32.436
Phew!
