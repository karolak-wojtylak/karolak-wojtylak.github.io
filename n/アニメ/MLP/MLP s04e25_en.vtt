WEBVTT

00:13.500 --> 00:15.767
Seems like only yesterday
I was saving this place

00:15.814 --> 00:17.363
from being totally destroyed.

00:17.619 --> 00:18.737
Hey, you guys remember that?

00:21.363 --> 00:24.887
You only mentioned it about
15 times on the train here.

00:25.125 --> 00:28.891
Yes, and we never hear a peep
out of you about your exploits.

00:29.231 --> 00:30.823
Heh heh. Point taken.

00:31.426 --> 00:32.911
I'm glad you all wanted to come,

00:33.194 --> 00:35.168
but I don't think it's
going to be that exciting.

00:35.611 --> 00:37.594
I pretty much just
have to smile and wave

00:37.600 --> 00:38.961
as the dignitaries arrive.

00:39.057 --> 00:41.931
Yes, but you get to smile
and wave like a princess.

00:42.339 --> 00:44.911
How exactly is that different
than smiling and waving

00:44.926 --> 00:46.840
like, not a princess?

00:48.109 --> 00:48.944
It isn't.

00:51.574 --> 00:53.170
What's wrong, Twilight?

00:53.562 --> 00:56.872
Why the long face?

00:57.467 --> 00:59.879
I've just been feeling a little
unsure about things lately.

01:00.224 --> 01:02.039
It doesn't seem that my
new role as a princess

01:02.040 --> 01:03.367
equates to all that much.

01:03.496 --> 01:04.442
That's just silly.

01:04.561 --> 01:06.815
You've got a real important
role in Equestria.

01:07.018 --> 01:09.322
Princess Celestia wouldn't have
asked you to come today

01:09.330 --> 01:11.147
if she didn't think so.

01:11.369 --> 01:12.495
I guess you're right.

01:12.794 --> 01:14.060
Of course we are.

01:14.314 --> 01:15.393
Now hurry along.

01:15.436 --> 01:17.424
You don't want to risk
having that important role

01:17.434 --> 01:20.234
diminished because you're tardy
for your regal meet and greet.

01:23.970 --> 01:26.236
The Duke and Duchess
of Mare-tonia.

01:49.453 --> 01:50.983
<i>That was it?</i>

01:51.646 --> 01:53.414
Princess Celestia had
you come all the way

01:53.424 --> 01:55.886
to the Crystal Empire
just to do that?

01:58.321 --> 02:00.993
I mean, whoa, really
regal and important!

02:10.464 --> 02:17.460
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies

02:51.754 --> 02:52.731
Your Highness.

02:53.034 --> 02:55.092
Thank you for understanding our
desire to keep the number

02:55.106 --> 02:57.207
of those privy to these
confidential discussions

02:57.213 --> 02:57.935
to a minimum.

02:58.193 --> 02:59.268
Of course.

03:08.854 --> 03:11.518
Is there anything else I can
do to assist with their visit?

03:11.683 --> 03:14.390
I'm sorry, Twilight, but
their visit is already over.

03:14.973 --> 03:15.605
Oh.

03:16.101 --> 03:17.000
Something wrong?

03:17.787 --> 03:20.265
I guess I just don't really
understand why I'm here.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.616
Couldn't one of the Royal Guard
have unfurled the banner?

03:23.030 --> 03:25.422
Having all four of us in
the Empire to greet them

03:25.432 --> 03:27.123
lets the dignitaries
know that their visit

03:27.133 --> 03:28.794
is considered an important one.

03:29.535 --> 03:31.242
Plus, it gives me
an opportunity

03:31.254 --> 03:33.108
to see my favorite
sister-in-law.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.049
And I'm happy to see you.

03:35.348 --> 03:35.986
All of you.

03:39.004 --> 03:39.791
But...

03:39.998 --> 03:40.727
But, I...

03:41.239 --> 03:43.717

You protect the Crystal Empire.

03:49.293 --> 03:50.702

03:51.002 --> 03:52.374
smile and wave.

Very sorry.

07:25.324 --> 07:26.468
You came out of nowhere.

07:27.912 --> 07:33.633
Is he friend or is he
foe, the pony wonders.

07:34.977 --> 07:36.565
I can assure you.

07:36.749 --> 07:39.847
I am no "friend".

07:40.263 --> 07:43.650
I am Lord Tirek.

07:44.138 --> 07:48.191
And I will take what should
have been mine long ago.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.520
Sister, are you all right?

08:12.138 --> 08:14.015
I've just had the
most terrible dream.

08:14.357 --> 08:16.015
Why do you think I'm here?

08:16.236 --> 08:19.802
You know as well as I that this
was not a dream, but a vision.

08:19.986 --> 08:21.479
Then we haven't much time.

08:21.687 --> 08:25.734
The stronger he becomes, the
more we are all in danger.

08:36.470 --> 08:38.581
<i>Tirek and his brother</i>
<i>Scorpan came here</i>

08:38.595 --> 08:42.146
<i>from a distant land, intent on</i>
<i>stealing Equestrian magic.</i>

08:42.550 --> 08:44.991
<i>But Scorpan soon came to</i>
<i>appreciate the ways</i>

08:45.006 --> 08:48.407
<i>of Equestria, even befriending</i>
<i>a young unicorn wizard.</i>

08:48.891 --> 08:51.656
Scorpan urged his brother
<i>to abandon their plans.</i>

08:52.037 --> 08:54.530
<i>When Tirek refused,</i>
<i>Scorpan alerted us</i>

08:54.546 --> 08:55.740
<i>to Tirek's intentions.</i>

08:56.228 --> 08:58.167
<i>Scorpan returned to his own land,</i>

08:58.858 --> 09:01.406
<i>and Tirek was sent to</i>
<i>Tartarus for his crimes.</i>

09:02.279 --> 09:05.057
But it appears he has
found a way to escape.

09:05.447 --> 09:07.566
We believe it happened
when Cerberus

09:07.570 --> 09:09.215
left his post at
the gates.

09:09.539 --> 09:11.041
But that was a long time ago.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.775
Why is he just now
starting to steal magic?

09:13.931 --> 09:16.481
His time in Tartarus
left him very weak.

09:16.590 --> 09:20.335
He has just now gained enough
strength to use his dark powers.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.828
But with each passing moment,
he grows stronger still.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.538
And I know just the
Princess who could stop him.

09:26.770 --> 09:28.144
Yes! I'll find him and--

09:28.154 --> 09:29.098
<i>No, Twilight,</i>

09:29.873 --> 09:32.458
I'm afraid I must call on
another to stop Tirek.

09:33.424 --> 09:34.374
Discord.

09:35.738 --> 09:38.238
As in Discord, Discord?

09:38.632 --> 09:39.332
Yes.

09:39.804 --> 09:42.138
I don't think it's
that big of a surprise.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.914
He can be very helpful.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.150
He can sense when there's a
magical imbalance.

09:48.368 --> 09:49.966
The next time
Tirek steals magic,

09:50.103 --> 09:51.775
Discord will be able
to track him down.

09:52.154 --> 09:54.360
So what are you supposed
to do in the meantime?

09:55.053 --> 09:56.228
Nothing.

09:56.948 --> 09:59.623
Unless of course one of you
needs me to smile and wave.

10:01.190 --> 10:02.158
Where are you going?

10:02.878 --> 10:04.606
To the Castle of
the Two Sisters.

10:04.936 --> 10:06.606
I'm not really
needed anywhere else.

10:06.911 --> 10:08.801
Might as well catch up
on some of my reading.

10:10.961 --> 10:12.066
You want some company?

10:13.250 --> 10:15.818
It has been a while since
we've visited the castle.

10:16.271 --> 10:17.198
Might be fun.

10:17.697 --> 10:19.925
Maybe I could use a
little company right now.

10:22.792 --> 10:24.911
I still can't believe

10:24.926 --> 10:26.825
we had to give
back the Elements.

10:27.207 --> 10:30.294
It had to be done or the Tree of
Harmony wouldn't have survived.

10:30.632 --> 10:32.046
But Twilight was right.

10:32.216 --> 10:35.906
Even without the Elements, our
friendship is as strong as ever.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.821
I just hope another
"friend" of ours

10:38.835 --> 10:41.010
never makes us sorry we
had to give them up.

10:41.303 --> 10:42.173
<i>Oh ho!</i>

10:42.181 --> 10:44.292
You're talking
about me, I presume?

10:45.281 --> 10:46.501
How'd you guess?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.257
My ears were burning.

10:50.156 --> 10:52.351
What are you even
doing here, Discord?

10:52.735 --> 10:55.207
Oh! Just a bit of light
reading before I head off

10:55.233 --> 10:57.531
on my extremely
important mission.

10:57.711 --> 10:59.418
I suppose you all know
that I've been tapped

10:59.484 --> 11:01.629
to capture a
certain escapee.

11:02.866 --> 11:03.914
Big deal.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.456
You're right, Spike,
it is a "big deal".

11:11.479 --> 11:14.296
Seems I possess a magic that
gives me quite an important role

11:14.300 --> 11:15.178
in Equestria.

11:15.414 --> 11:18.327
Maybe they should make
me an Alicorn Princess.

11:24.173 --> 11:25.695
In your dreams.

11:27.094 --> 11:29.090
Oh, I never dream
of such things.

11:29.914 --> 11:31.377
Ask Princess Luna.

11:31.777 --> 11:33.949
Don't you have a creepy
magic-stealing villain

11:33.953 --> 11:34.926
to track down?

11:35.164 --> 11:36.764
Yes, yes, yes, of course.

11:37.982 --> 11:40.700
It's just that I couldn't help
but notice that Twilight

11:40.817 --> 11:43.555
hasn't yet opened this
little chest of hers.

11:45.344 --> 11:46.913
It got me thinking.

11:47.180 --> 11:49.769
What if what's locked inside is
something that could help her

11:49.836 --> 11:51.531
prove her royal worth?

11:51.736 --> 11:54.655
I only bring it up because she
said that she'd been feeling

11:54.663 --> 11:57.880
like her role as a princess
doesn't equate to much.

12:00.105 --> 12:00.963
Wait a minute!

12:01.151 --> 12:03.043
How do you know how
she was feeling?

12:03.309 --> 12:04.306
Oh, my.

12:04.343 --> 12:06.400
Is eavesdropping not the way
you're supposed to find out

12:06.411 --> 12:08.206
what your best pals are up to?

12:08.312 --> 12:09.642
Woe is me.

12:09.863 --> 12:13.775
Will I ever learn the intricate
nuances of being a good friend?

12:16.895 --> 12:17.389
Ahem!

12:17.438 --> 12:20.741
Well, in any case, I suppose
now is as good a time as any

12:20.757 --> 12:22.544
for me to make my exit.

12:24.448 --> 12:25.787
And good riddance!

12:26.148 --> 12:28.300
Oopsey doopsey,

12:28.314 --> 12:32.472
I almost left with the little
journal you've all been keeping.

12:32.833 --> 12:34.407
What a fascinating read.

12:34.618 --> 12:37.328
Haven't you girls
just learned so much?

12:37.576 --> 12:39.826
I've bookmarked a few of the
more interesting passages.

12:39.838 --> 12:41.884
You really should take a look.

12:43.151 --> 12:45.484
We're still on for tea later
aren't we, Fluttershy?

12:45.799 --> 12:47.291
I wouldn't miss it.

12:48.542 --> 12:52.226
I'll bring the
cucumber sandwiches.

12:53.601 --> 12:57.898
Sometimes I think the "reformed"
Discord is more obnoxious

12:57.904 --> 13:00.427
than the "before he
was reformed" Discord.

13:00.669 --> 13:01.635
Indeed.

13:01.746 --> 13:03.695
But he could be
right, couldn't he?

13:03.896 --> 13:06.850
<i>What if there is something</i>
<i>important in that chest?</i>

13:09.945 --> 13:11.845
There's only one
way to find out.

13:19.346 --> 13:20.128
Anything?

13:22.856 --> 13:24.626
There must be something
in this library

13:24.634 --> 13:26.415
that can help me figure
out how to open it.

13:26.731 --> 13:28.673
The answer is in
one of these books.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.255
I just know it.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.130
Tirek, I presume.

14:00.499 --> 14:01.428
Discord.

14:01.871 --> 14:03.168
You're free?

14:04.040 --> 14:05.118
As a bird.

14:05.432 --> 14:07.627
I commend you on
your escape.

14:08.618 --> 14:10.716
I'm afraid the
feeling isn't mutual.

14:16.807 --> 14:19.531
I should have known you would
want to have Equestria

14:19.549 --> 14:20.710
all to yourself.

14:20.872 --> 14:22.220
Oh, I'm not doing
this for me.

14:22.310 --> 14:23.916
I'm doing it for my friends.

14:24.314 --> 14:27.338
Just between the two of us,
it's mostly for Fluttershy.

14:28.048 --> 14:29.211
Fluttershy?

14:29.404 --> 14:31.141
You're not saying
you're friends with...

14:31.582 --> 14:32.534
Ponies!

14:33.280 --> 14:34.846
Surprise!

14:36.372 --> 14:40.442
I am surprised that someone with
your intellect does not see

14:40.458 --> 14:44.913
this "friendship" is but a
new form of imprisonment.

14:45.127 --> 14:47.719
Clearly you've had to
abandon your true nature

14:47.728 --> 14:49.760
to stay in their good graces.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.258
I have done nothing of the sort.

14:57.769 --> 15:00.577
Please. I've seen this before.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.772
But he was always weak-minded.

15:03.053 --> 15:04.634
You are Discord.

15:04.675 --> 15:06.150
You are legend.

15:06.165 --> 15:09.904
You cannot fall into the same
trap that claimed my brother.

15:10.187 --> 15:14.245
Help me to grow strong and be
rewarded with something

15:14.277 --> 15:19.213
far greater than
friendship...freedom.

15:21.157 --> 15:24.265
Once I have stripped these
ponies of their magic,

15:24.831 --> 15:27.176
nothing would give
me greater pleasure

15:27.184 --> 15:30.191
than to see their world
turned upside down.

15:30.960 --> 15:35.322
Who better to do so than the
master of chaos himself?

15:36.958 --> 15:41.278
Join me, Discord, and
reclaim your greatness.

15:41.518 --> 15:44.374
Unless, of course,
"pony errand boy"

15:44.384 --> 15:48.415
is the role you've always
wanted to play in this world.

16:01.281 --> 16:02.720
I think I've found something!

16:03.307 --> 16:05.356
I've been reading our journal
and there's something

16:05.389 --> 16:07.697
interesting about the sections
that Discord bookmarked.

16:08.263 --> 16:10.989
Applejack, do you remember
when you had to tell everypony

16:11.028 --> 16:13.106
that the tonic Granny bought
from the Flim-Flam brothers

16:13.114 --> 16:14.238
didn't really work?

16:14.489 --> 16:15.523
How could I forget?

16:15.843 --> 16:18.641
It was one of the hardest
things I ever had to do.

16:25.533 --> 16:27.274
I hate to disappoint everypony,

16:27.477 --> 16:29.707
but there's no way Granny
could have made that dive

16:29.769 --> 16:32.091
because this tonic is a fake.

16:33.966 --> 16:36.694
But in that moment, I
knew had to be honest.

16:37.049 --> 16:38.134
I just knew it.

16:38.306 --> 16:40.995
But what that's got to do
with opening the chest?

16:41.447 --> 16:43.888
I've found that each of you
has had to face a situation

16:44.236 --> 16:45.962
where living up to the
Element of Harmony

16:45.970 --> 16:47.486
you represent wasn't easy.

16:48.052 --> 16:50.259
Fluttershy, it was when you
realized that the way to show

16:50.310 --> 16:53.444
kindness to the Breezies was by
forcing them to leave your home.

16:53.644 --> 16:56.107
<i>The looks on their</i>
<i>poor little faces.</i>

17:00.643 --> 17:02.850
<i>But I knew that as</i>
<i>difficult as it was,</i>

17:03.100 --> 17:05.765
pushing them away was the
kindest thing I could do.

17:06.218 --> 17:09.650
Rarity, even after Suri took
advantage of your generosity

17:09.701 --> 17:10.901
at Fashion Week
in Manehattan,

17:11.213 --> 17:13.929
<i>you didn't let it cause you to</i>
<i>abandon your generous spirit.</i>

17:14.191 --> 17:16.033
I simply couldn't have
lived with myself

17:16.105 --> 17:17.929
if I didn't do something
special for the friends

17:17.935 --> 17:20.380
who have always been
so generous to me.

17:20.632 --> 17:23.810
Rainbow Dash, you had the chance
to fly with the Wonderbolts

17:23.845 --> 17:25.116
at the Equestria Games

17:25.365 --> 17:27.783
but instead you chose to
compete with your friends.

17:27.859 --> 17:30.977
Sure. But being loyal to my
friends was way ...

17:31.055 --> 17:32.144
My turn! My turn!

17:32.630 --> 17:35.711
Pinkie Pie, you realized that
seeing your friend laugh

17:35.935 --> 17:38.540
was more important than proving
you were a better party planner

17:38.558 --> 17:39.666
than Cheese Sandwich.

17:39.943 --> 17:41.970
Best party I've ever had.

17:42.173 --> 17:44.903
It's clear we've all had our
moments to shine, Twilight,

17:45.254 --> 17:46.238
but I'm with Applejack.

17:46.618 --> 17:47.964
What does any of
this have to do

17:47.974 --> 17:49.553
with the opening of the chest?

17:49.939 --> 17:51.875
All of you had tough
choices to make,

17:52.191 --> 17:54.667
<i>but when you made the right</i>
<i>one and embraced your Element,</i>

17:54.903 --> 17:57.190
<i>it helped somepony else</i>
<i>make the right choice too.</i>

17:57.890 --> 17:59.834
<i>Each of you received</i>
<i>something from the pony</i>

17:59.847 --> 18:01.293
<i>whose life you helped change.</i>

18:02.247 --> 18:05.350
I know it sounds crazy, but
maybe there's something special

18:05.363 --> 18:07.361
about those objects that could
lead us to the location

18:07.375 --> 18:08.204
of the keys.

18:08.653 --> 18:10.647
The chest is connected
to the Tree of Harmony.

18:11.143 --> 18:12.967
The Tree is connected
to the Elements,

18:13.059 --> 18:15.248
and the Elements are
connected to all of us.

18:15.615 --> 18:17.358
There must be a connection!

18:17.650 --> 18:19.697
I hate to admit it,
but maybe Discord

18:19.705 --> 18:21.644
was trying to be a
good friend after all.

18:23.940 --> 18:26.425
I don't see anything on them
that would give us a clue

18:26.433 --> 18:28.300
as to where the keys might be.

18:28.561 --> 18:31.069
They're just ordinary,
everyday objects.

18:31.233 --> 18:32.610
Come on, Boneless!

18:32.745 --> 18:34.140
Give us that key!

18:35.065 --> 18:36.733
I don't think that's
going to work.

19:05.051 --> 19:06.439
There's still one key missing.

19:07.004 --> 19:09.180
The key that represents
the Element of Magic.

19:09.664 --> 19:10.602
My Element.

19:11.096 --> 19:13.586
Oh, but I'm sure that if
we've gotten our keys,

19:13.642 --> 19:15.285
you have too, Twilight.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.950
Think, Twilight! When have you
completed a difficult magical

19:18.963 --> 19:22.821
task and in doing so encouraged
another pony to do the same?

19:23.049 --> 19:23.855
I haven't.

19:24.138 --> 19:26.296
If I had, I would have written
about it in the Journal.

19:27.055 --> 19:29.935
Don't worry, Twilight, I'm sure
you'll get your key eventually.

19:36.515 --> 19:37.350
What's it say?

19:37.713 --> 19:39.758
That I'm needed in
Canterlot at once.

19:45.235 --> 19:46.893
I came as quickly as I could.

19:47.045 --> 19:47.962
Is something wrong?

19:48.128 --> 19:48.909
Is it Tirek?

19:49.307 --> 19:51.869
I am afraid I put too
much trust in Discord

19:52.062 --> 19:54.337
and the effect that friendship
would have upon him.

19:58.392 --> 20:00.665
<i>Discord has betrayed</i>
<i>the ponies of Equestria</i>

20:00.961 --> 20:02.690
<i>and joined forces with Tirek.</i>

20:20.113 --> 20:21.254
How could he do this?

20:21.615 --> 20:23.746
I thought our friendship
meant something to him.

20:24.007 --> 20:25.600
I thought he had changed.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.745
Tirek has stolen enough magic
that he now has the strength

20:28.788 --> 20:30.165
<i>to steal flight as well.</i>

20:34.437 --> 20:36.165
Without Pegasi to
control the weather,

20:36.515 --> 20:38.431
<i>there will be no</i>
<i>rain in Equestria.</i>

20:39.923 --> 20:42.269
<i>There is word he has gone</i>
<i>after earth ponies as well.</i>

20:45.695 --> 20:46.753
<i>Without their strength,</i>

20:46.815 --> 20:48.679
<i>they will not be able</i>
<i>to tend the land.</i>

20:51.912 --> 20:54.423
Ponies will no longer be
in control of their world.

20:54.759 --> 20:57.192
That power will
belong solely to Tirek.

20:57.358 --> 21:00.626
There is no doubt that Tirek
is after alicorn magic.

21:00.985 --> 21:02.526
With Discord by his side,

21:02.741 --> 21:05.159
we will not be able to
stop him from taking it.

21:05.469 --> 21:06.997
Once it is in his possession,

21:07.342 --> 21:10.866
his power will know no bounds
and all hope will be lost.

21:11.527 --> 21:13.596
But there is one solution.

21:15.137 --> 21:17.539
It is only by making
this sacrifice

21:17.658 --> 21:20.723
that Equestria and the lands
beyond it might be saved.

21:22.372 --> 21:24.821
We must rid ourselves
of our magic

21:24.983 --> 21:27.685
before Tirek has the chance
to steal it from us.
