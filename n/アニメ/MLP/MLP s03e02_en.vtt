00:03.520 --> 00:06.160
You wanted to see me?
To give me a test?

00:06.310 --> 00:08.520
The Crystal Empire has returned.

00:08.670 --> 00:11.740
You want me to help protect
an entire empire?

00:11.890 --> 00:14.050
It must be you, and you alone.

00:14.550 --> 00:16.360
But, what if I fail?

00:16.510 --> 00:18.040
Let's just say the empire...

00:18.190 --> 00:19.700
isn't the only thing that's returned.

00:21.390 --> 00:22.700
Go, go!

00:22.850 --> 00:25.710
Sparklriffic!

00:25.860 --> 00:28.770
With Cadance putting all her strength
into keeping her spell going,

00:28.920 --> 00:31.670
and me trying to keep an eye
on signs of trouble in the arctic,

00:31.820 --> 00:35.250
we haven't been able to gather
much information from the Crystal Ponies.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.670
There are Crystal Ponies?!

00:36.820 --> 00:38.000
I wish I could help you.

00:38.150 --> 00:42.010
But I can't seem to remember anything
before King Sombra came to power.

00:43.430 --> 00:45.680
History of the Crystal Empire.

00:45.820 --> 00:49.150
The last page of the book mentioned
a crystal heart as the fair's centerpiece,

00:49.300 --> 00:52.100
so I used my magic to cut one
out of a crystal block.

00:52.250 --> 00:56.140
The whole purpose of the Crystal Fair
is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies,

00:56.290 --> 00:58.090
so the light within them
can power the Crystal Heart,

00:58.240 --> 00:59.740
so that the empire can be protected!

00:59.920 --> 01:02.110
I think we may have
a problem...

01:02.260 --> 01:04.200
I didn't know it was an actual relic!

01:04.350 --> 01:05.950
It's alright, Twilight.

01:06.580 --> 01:07.830
Twilie...

The Crystal Empire, Part 2

01:58.680 --> 02:00.460
The empire is under attack.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.300
I have to find the Crystal Heart!

02:23.450 --> 02:25.640
No, you stay here with Cadance.

02:25.780 --> 02:27.600
She needs you, Shining Armor.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.130
I'll retrieve the Heart.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.540
Let's do this.

02:31.690 --> 02:34.830
I've been trying to figure out
how I'm meant to pass Celestia's test.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.300
Retrieving the Crystal Heart must be it.

02:37.450 --> 02:39.200
But there is something else you can do.

02:39.350 --> 02:40.150
Name it.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.890
You and the rest of our friends
have to keep the fair going.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.120
What? With that thing
moving into the empire?!

02:46.270 --> 02:49.750
The whole purpose of the Crystal Fair
is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies,

02:49.900 --> 02:51.750
so they can activate the Crystal Heart.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.130
Yeah, and?

02:53.280 --> 02:57.100
If the Crystal Ponies find out King Sombra
is trying to take over the empire again,

02:57.250 --> 02:59.950
their spirits are gonna be
anything but lifted.

03:01.750 --> 03:05.470
It won't matter if I find the Crystal Heart.
They won't be able to make it work.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.020
You have to keep them happy
here at the fair.

03:08.170 --> 03:11.240
Keep the fair going and
the Crystal Ponies' spirits high.

03:11.490 --> 03:12.950
Done and done.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.250
Twilie,
be careful.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.240
I will.

03:49.660 --> 03:53.960
I just found out they're offering
face painting for the little ones.

03:58.270 --> 04:01.030
We can do that.
Twilight's doing what?!

04:02.330 --> 04:07.370
He... really... loves
getting his face painted.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.480
Who wants a flugelhorn?

04:11.630 --> 04:13.380
I want a flugelhorn!

04:14.050 --> 04:16.370
Who else wants a flugelhorn?

04:16.520 --> 04:18.630
I want a flugelhorn!!

04:22.450 --> 04:23.730
Twilight, wait!

04:24.400 --> 04:25.570
I'm coming with you!

04:25.720 --> 04:29.390
You can't. I have to retrieve
the Crystal Heart by myself.

04:30.010 --> 04:33.530
I know. I promise
I won't lift a claw to help you.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.290
Not a claw, Spike.

04:38.870 --> 04:40.450
Where are we going, exactly?

04:40.600 --> 04:43.540
I think I might know where
King Sombra hid the Crystal Heart.

04:43.790 --> 04:45.040
The castle?

04:45.190 --> 04:46.460
The king would've been
counting on the fact

04:46.610 --> 04:49.150
that nopony would dare
come looking for it here.

04:49.310 --> 04:51.040
They'd've been too afraid to even try.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.040
I hope you're right.

04:53.190 --> 04:54.670
You and me both.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.500
What are you lookin' at?!

05:06.990 --> 05:08.720
That's what I thought!

05:09.790 --> 05:11.530
Uh, Rainbow Dash?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.850
We're supposed to be actin'
like nothing's wrong.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.100
Exactly!

05:17.750 --> 05:20.590
What I mean is,
maybe you should let me

05:20.740 --> 05:22.880
keep the Crystal Ponies away
from the fake heart,

05:23.030 --> 05:25.480
while you show off
your joustin' skills.

05:25.930 --> 05:31.150
Seeing my awesomeness does have a way
of putting ponies into a pretty good mood.

05:38.950 --> 05:41.650
Come on, Knight Fluttershy.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.430
It's showtime.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.650
How are y'all feelin'?
Havin' a good time?

05:46.800 --> 05:48.960
The best I've had
in over a thousand years!

05:49.110 --> 05:52.590
That's good! Gotta renew
that spirit of love and unity

05:52.740 --> 05:55.130
if you're gonna power up
that Crystal Heart, right?

05:55.290 --> 05:57.950
I sure would like to see it
before the ceremony.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.820
It's been such a long time.

05:59.970 --> 06:02.600
Oh, I hear ya, but,
uh... phew!

06:02.760 --> 06:04.790
I'm gettin' a little toasty out here.

06:04.940 --> 06:08.370
Bet you'd like to cool off
with a little Crystal Empire nectar!

06:12.590 --> 06:15.670
Uh, you tried
the Crystal Empire fritters yet?

06:15.820 --> 06:18.030
Made from a traditional
Crystal Empire recipe!

06:18.180 --> 06:19.600
You're gonna love 'em!

06:21.080 --> 06:23.230
I hear there's a joustin' match
about to start!

06:23.380 --> 06:24.900
You don't wanna miss that!

06:26.310 --> 06:31.110
Come on, Twilight... these Crystal Ponies
are more curious than a cat!

06:38.580 --> 06:41.750
It's gotta be here somewhere.
It's just gotta be!

06:43.980 --> 06:46.080
Not a claw, Spike.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.940
Celestia's orders!

06:56.460 --> 06:59.570
<i>If the empire is filled
with hope and love,</i>

06:59.730 --> 07:02.630
<i>those things are reflected
across all of Equestria.</i>

07:02.780 --> 07:05.610
<i>If hatred and fear take hold...</i>

07:08.850 --> 07:10.290
Of course!

07:12.310 --> 07:14.190
- What? Did you find it?!
- No!

07:14.340 --> 07:17.190
Because this isn't
King Sombra's castle.

07:17.340 --> 07:19.320
Isn't this where he lived
when he was in power?

07:19.470 --> 07:22.620
It is. But it didn't look like this.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.250
When did you learn to do that?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.630
That was a little trick
Celestia taught me.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.580
You stay here.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.720
If you insist.

07:58.150 --> 08:00.780
Can you see what's down there yet?

08:01.080 --> 08:04.980
Not yet. I can't even tell
how far down this goes!

08:19.700 --> 08:21.750
- Spike?
- Yeah?

08:21.900 --> 08:23.680
Can you see outside?

08:29.090 --> 08:34.750
<i>Yes... crystals... </i>

08:36.060 --> 08:40.370
It's not good! Cadance's magic
must be fading faster than before!

08:48.140 --> 08:50.450
Twilight?
Are you okay?

08:50.990 --> 08:52.250
Yes...

09:01.790 --> 09:03.250
What in the...

09:03.960 --> 09:05.090
Stop...

09:06.250 --> 09:07.260
moving!

09:14.400 --> 09:17.440
Spike, I think it's here!

09:24.080 --> 09:26.450
What are you doing here?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.020
I don't know!
I opened the door and--

09:29.170 --> 09:30.570
And now you must go.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.210
Go where?

09:33.360 --> 09:36.780
Doesn't matter to me.
You failed the test, Twilight!

09:44.750 --> 09:47.270
I don't understand! The test--

09:47.420 --> 09:50.590
Not only will you not move on
to the next level of your studies,

09:50.740 --> 09:53.500
you won't continue your studies at all!

09:54.500 --> 09:58.360
You didn't say anything about
no longer being your student if I failed!

10:00.360 --> 10:01.640
Didn't I?

10:02.780 --> 10:05.250
But... what do I do now?!

10:09.650 --> 10:10.990
<i>Twilight!</i>

10:11.550 --> 10:12.550
<i>Twilight?</i>

10:13.550 --> 10:14.950
Twilight!

10:15.900 --> 10:17.990
Twiliiiight!

10:19.260 --> 10:20.640
I know you told me to stay up there,

10:20.650 --> 10:21.850
but you were down here
for such a long time

10:21.860 --> 10:23.630
and you weren't answering
and I got worried so I came down here,

10:23.640 --> 10:25.000
and you were just
staring at that wall...

10:25.010 --> 10:27.550
I was calling your name, but I couldn't
seem to get your attention, and...

10:28.380 --> 10:32.050
What were you looking at?
I mean... it's just a wall.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.590
Ponyville?!

10:35.300 --> 10:36.310
How did I get...

10:36.460 --> 10:39.200
No! I don't wanna go!

10:39.350 --> 10:41.700
Please, Twilight, don't leave me!

10:42.730 --> 10:47.370
King Sombra's dark magic.
A doorway that leads to your worst fear.

10:47.860 --> 10:51.250
We were home... you told me
you didn't need me any more.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.150
You were sending me away...

10:53.300 --> 10:57.150
A fear that will never come to pass.
I'm never gonna send you away.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.550
And I'm not gonna fail my test!

11:05.100 --> 11:06.650
What's in there?

11:07.550 --> 11:08.750
Stairs.

11:09.450 --> 11:11.710
Lots and lots of stairs.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.310
Maybe you should come
with me this time.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.700
Bravo, knight Rainbow Dash!

12:09.680 --> 12:11.950
Isn't there...
somepony else who could...

12:12.100 --> 12:15.320
take over the jousting demonstration
with you?

12:16.310 --> 12:21.450
The fate of an entire empire rests on us
showing these ponies a good time.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.500
But, y'know,
if that isn't important to you...

12:27.640 --> 12:30.500
Okay, okay,
I'll take it easy on you next time.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.170
But not too easy.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.550
I've got a reputation to maintain!

12:44.970 --> 12:47.470
What if this is just more of his magic?

12:47.630 --> 12:50.020
He makes a door that links
to your worst nightmare...

12:50.170 --> 12:52.650
why not a staircase
that goes on forever?

12:57.800 --> 12:59.200
Hold on to me.

13:26.300 --> 13:29.650
I am running out of weaving materials
for the traditional crafts booths!

13:29.800 --> 13:33.230
I've just made a hat out of
three pieces of hay and a drinking straw!

13:33.380 --> 13:35.450
I made it work. But still!

13:35.600 --> 13:38.280
We gotta do everything we can
to keep this thing goin'.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.280
The Princess isn't lookin' so good.

13:41.430 --> 13:44.500
I can imagine her magic
is gonna last much longer.

13:44.650 --> 13:46.370
It's gonna be fine.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.380
These ponies are gonna power up
that Crystal Heart when the time comes,

13:49.530 --> 13:51.800
and we won't be needin'
her magic anyway.

13:51.950 --> 13:55.850
I sure hope that time comes soon!
Even I can't keep this party going forever!

14:09.200 --> 14:11.360
This isn't the Crystal Heart.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.440
Oh, of course it isn't.

14:14.590 --> 14:16.520
- The real one is--
- On its way!

14:16.670 --> 14:21.400
I was going to say 'being polished'
to buy us some more time?

14:21.550 --> 14:22.330
Oops.

14:26.180 --> 14:29.250
<i>Crystal Heart... </i>

14:32.250 --> 14:35.760
I actually studied gravity spells,
thinking it might be on our test!

14:35.910 --> 14:38.760
Turns out I was prepared for this!

15:10.240 --> 15:12.500
The Heart...
where's the Crystal--

15:12.510 --> 15:15.160
Here! It rolled over to me
when you dropped it!

15:15.310 --> 15:16.380
Don't move!

15:18.700 --> 15:20.950
You can move, just not toward me!

15:25.950 --> 15:27.650
How could I have been so foolish...?

15:27.800 --> 15:29.430
I was just so eager to get it!

15:29.880 --> 15:31.860
Then when I saw what
was going on outside, I...

15:32.010 --> 15:33.690
You have to get out of there, Twilight!

15:33.840 --> 15:35.990
You have to be the one who brings
the Crystal Heart to Princess Cadance!

15:36.410 --> 15:38.990
If you don't,
you'll fail Celestia's test!

15:39.350 --> 15:41.870
King Sombra is already attacking
the Empire.

15:42.020 --> 15:44.550
He could reach the Crystal Ponies
at any moment...

15:44.700 --> 15:48.450
reach Princess Cadance,
my brother, my friends...

15:48.600 --> 15:51.700
There may not be enough time for me
to find a way to escape.

15:57.010 --> 16:00.390
You have to be the one
to bring the Crystal Heart to the fair.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.100
Me? But Twilight--

16:02.250 --> 16:04.260
Go.
Go!

16:12.430 --> 16:15.940
Don't y'all worry
your pretty little crystal heads!

16:16.090 --> 16:19.150
The real Crystal Heart
will be here any second!

16:19.240 --> 16:21.250
I don't know if they believe you...

16:21.400 --> 16:23.700
Don't know if I believe me...

16:31.440 --> 16:33.760
He's back! I can't take it!

16:36.810 --> 16:38.090
King Sombra...

16:38.400 --> 16:42.550
<i>My crystal slaves... </i>

16:47.800 --> 16:50.140
- Hey! Up here!
- Spike?

16:50.290 --> 16:51.720
I got the Crystal Heart!

16:53.540 --> 16:55.920
<i>That is mine! </i>

17:06.060 --> 17:07.770
Spikey-Wikey!

17:30.360 --> 17:32.890
Behold! The Crystal Princess!

17:34.060 --> 17:36.200
The Crystal Heart has returned.

17:36.350 --> 17:40.750
Use the light and love within you
to ensure that King Sombra does not.

17:52.450 --> 17:57.760
<i>What?
No... No! Stop! </i>

18:52.590 --> 18:54.300
Good job, Spike.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.240
I do so wish it was permanent.

19:03.390 --> 19:06.000
Did you see how
my mane just absolutely sparkled?

19:06.150 --> 19:09.750
But... good things are better
when they're a rarity.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.030
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:12.570 --> 19:16.750
You've gotta stop saving my rump like this,
it's starting to get embarrassing.

19:17.750 --> 19:21.380
Wasn't me who saved you in the end.
It was Spike.

19:21.530 --> 19:24.400
It's just a test.
Maybe she'll let you retake it.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.990
I don't think she's gonna
give me a new test.

19:31.910 --> 19:35.980
Keep it together, buddy...
gotta stay strong... for Twilight...

19:36.190 --> 19:37.680
It's beautiful.

19:37.830 --> 19:40.470
I wish it had been me
who ultimately made it so.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.300
But it wasn't.

19:42.450 --> 19:44.360
Twilight,
as I understand it,

19:44.510 --> 19:46.690
Spike brought Princess Cadance
the Crystal Heart

19:46.840 --> 19:50.650
because you weren't sure how quickly
you could find a way to escape the tower.

19:50.990 --> 19:55.150
You weren't willing to risk the future
of the citizens of the Crystal Empire

19:55.300 --> 19:58.160
in an effort to guarantee your own.

19:58.310 --> 20:02.200
Far better that I have a student who
understands the meaning of self-sacrifice

20:02.350 --> 20:05.500
than one who only looks out
for her own best interests.

20:05.650 --> 20:06.950
Does this mean...?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.900
She's totally gonna lose it!

20:13.070 --> 20:17.150
Keep it together, buddy...
gotta stay strong... for Twilight...!

20:19.300 --> 20:21.100
I passed!

20:25.790 --> 20:29.730
<i>You were prepared to do your best </i>

20:29.880 --> 20:33.370
<i>Had what it takes to pass the test </i>

20:33.520 --> 20:36.810
<i>All those doubts you can dismiss </i>

20:36.970 --> 20:42.350
<i>Turns out
you were prepared for this! </i>

20:42.800 --> 20:45.550
<i>You clearly have just what it takes </i>

20:46.500 --> 20:48.920
<i>To pass the test with such high stakes </i>

20:50.060 --> 20:53.470
<i>We knew for sure you would prevail </i>

20:53.750 --> 20:57.020
<i>Since when does
Twilight Sparkle ever fail? </i>

20:57.750 --> 21:01.230
<i>All those doubts that you can dismiss </i>

21:01.380 --> 21:04.650
<i>Trust yourself and you cannot miss </i>

21:04.800 --> 21:06.420
<i>Turns out you were </i>

21:06.570 --> 21:08.480
<i>Turns out I was </i>

21:08.630 --> 21:10.140
<i>Turns out you were </i>

21:10.290 --> 21:12.240
<i>Turns out I was </i>

21:12.390 --> 21:20.030
<i>Turns out you were prepared for this!</i>

21:24.860 --> 21:28.250
Yeah, I knew everything
was gonna be fine.
