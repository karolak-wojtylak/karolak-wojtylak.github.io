00:02.180 --> 00:04.620
We're so happy you
could come have lunch

00:04.660 --> 00:06.660
with your father
and me, Fluttershy.

00:07.100 --> 00:08.560
I'm so glad you asked.

00:08.780 --> 00:11.040
And it was super awesome
of you to invite me too.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.640
Things have been so busy
with the Wonderbolts lately;

00:13.780 --> 00:16.740
it's great to get a chance
to relax someplace quiet.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.960
That's exactly what I intend
to do now that I've retired.

00:20.180 --> 00:21.960
In fact, I converted
the back house

00:22.000 --> 00:23.660
to showcase my
cloud collection.

00:24.440 --> 00:27.200
I have my clouds; your
mom has her flowers;

00:27.420 --> 00:29.600
you've got your animals
and your brother...

00:31.420 --> 00:35.100
Zephyr Breeze has
his... interests.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.980
I'll say. Remember when he
was convinced square clouds

00:39.020 --> 00:41.700
were gonna be the next
big thing?

00:42.020 --> 00:44.240
He's matured a
lot since then.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.200
Actually, it's funny
you bring Zephyr up.

00:49.820 --> 00:52.700
Oh, no! Not again.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.460
It's just for a
little while, dear.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.000
Till he gets back
on his hooves.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.360
Wait. You don't mean?

01:00.700 --> 01:02.200
Guess who's home?

01:02.660 --> 01:04.660
That's right, big sis,
it's your one and only,

01:04.720 --> 01:06.660
favorite little
brother... moi!

01:07.680 --> 01:08.980
Awww.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.360
Hi, Flutter-butter!

01:51.440 --> 01:53.580
How's the bestest
big sister ever?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.200
Hey, where's the love?

01:56.400 --> 01:58.540
How about a little excitement
to see your baby brother?

02:00.740 --> 02:01.980
I'm just surprised.

02:02.260 --> 02:05.220
When you left, you said mane
therapy was your calling.

02:05.660 --> 02:09.560
Oh, it is, sis. It is. You would
not believe how much stress

02:09.620 --> 02:11.380
ponies hold in
their manes.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.130
Everything gets limp
and unmanageable.

02:14.480 --> 02:18.020
No offense, but brushing alone
won't solve the problem.

02:20.540 --> 02:21.560
What went wrong?

02:22.040 --> 02:23.920
Nothing went wrong
per se.

02:24.680 --> 02:27.820
It's just "the powers that
be" were so locked into their

02:27.940 --> 02:30.620
"required styles"
and you know me.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.680
I've got my own style
and I think they were

02:33.760 --> 02:34.860
a little threatened.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.650
Oh, this is lovely, dear.

02:41.380 --> 02:42.060
Ugh.

02:42.160 --> 02:48.400
Well, if it isn't Rainbows "the
best flier that ever was" Dash.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.760
Oh, this ought be good.

02:51.340 --> 02:53.100
Sorry, I shouldn't
tease ya.

02:53.380 --> 02:57.260
I know the whole "super awesome
flyer" bit's just to impress me.

02:58.420 --> 03:01.360
Still, thanks for showing up for
my homecoming, it's, it's sweet.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.400
I kinda thought there'd
be more ponies here.

03:05.580 --> 03:09.120
I mean, what about your party
planner friend? Sprinkle Pie?

03:09.240 --> 03:12.940
She coulda turned this into a
real house par-tay, am I right?

03:13.400 --> 03:14.900
I mean, this place
could use it.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.800
<i> ♪ Dra-ahb! ♪</i>

03:17.740 --> 03:18.980
I, I ...

03:19.060 --> 03:21.240
We have been meaning
to redecorate.

03:22.460 --> 03:25.800
Dad, please, when I get all my
stuff back in here, you won't

03:25.860 --> 03:28.260
even remember what this
boring old place looked like.

03:32.540 --> 03:36.220
Um, Mom, Dad? Can I talk
to you for a second?

03:39.060 --> 03:40.400
What is it, honey?

03:40.520 --> 03:43.780
I'm not so sure letting Zephyr
move back home is a good idea.

03:44.060 --> 03:45.320
I know you both
want to help,

03:45.380 --> 03:47.200
but don't you
remember last time?

03:47.640 --> 03:50.440
Zephyr's just trying to
find his place, dear.

03:51.420 --> 03:54.200
I know. It just seems like
his place always ends up

03:54.240 --> 03:55.430
being your place.

03:55.820 --> 03:59.180
And then he sort of makes
you do everything for him.

03:59.420 --> 04:02.680
Well, we may not be as
bold as you, Fluttershy,

04:02.720 --> 04:06.040
but don't you worry. We know
how to stand up for ourselves.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.760
And they were all like, "We
love your free spirit, Zeph

04:11.980 --> 04:16.000
and it would be wrong to cage
that. Go follow your dreams."

04:20.460 --> 04:23.700
Zeph was just telling me
all about the ins and outs

04:23.740 --> 04:25.660
of Mane Therapy School.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.430
It's all so political. I
just could not take it.

04:30.660 --> 04:34.120
Well, maybe if you stuck with
it for more than a few weeks?

04:34.340 --> 04:36.840
Sorry, sis, but when
something's not the right fit,

04:37.120 --> 04:38.920
this pony's gotta fly!

04:41.040 --> 04:42.960
Anyway, good talk, Rainbows.

04:43.060 --> 04:45.720
I am so touched you
came to see me, really,

04:45.980 --> 04:47.700
I hate to deprive
you of my presence,

04:47.780 --> 04:49.920
but this Breeze needs his Zs.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.900
You know it's the middle
of the day, right?

04:53.360 --> 04:55.360
I know. SIESTA!

04:55.700 --> 04:57.420
I'm just gonna assume
you made up my room

04:57.460 --> 04:58.660
the way I like
it, right, Mom?

04:59.780 --> 05:02.420
Ooh, I almost forgot. All
my stuff is out front.

05:02.740 --> 05:04.720
Wanna grab that for
me, Pops? Thanks!

05:05.900 --> 05:08.600
Same old "Zeph."

05:13.940 --> 05:16.560
I know you weren't expecting
to see your brother,

05:16.620 --> 05:19.880
but you've been kinda
quiet. Even for you.

05:20.600 --> 05:26.280
I'm sorry, but I am just
so... so peeved right now!

05:28.860 --> 05:30.060
Excuse my language.

05:32.040 --> 05:37.120
Rainbow Dash! Fluttershy! It's
me, Pinkie Pie! Your friend!

05:42.580 --> 05:44.600
Oh, um, sorry about that.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.060
We just had lunch with
Fluttershy's parents

05:47.100 --> 05:49.340
and you'll never
guess who showed up.

05:49.900 --> 05:54.060
Ooh, Mayor Mare? Cranky Doodle
Donkey? Cheese Sandwich?

05:54.100 --> 05:55.260
Miss Harshwhinny?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.000
Zephyr Breeze.

05:58.220 --> 06:00.180
Oh, that makes more sense.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.860
And from the look
on your face,

06:01.900 --> 06:04.980
I'm guessing it's for another
one of his 'extended' stays.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.040
She's a bit peeved.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.160
Zephyr is my brother
and I love him,

06:11.460 --> 06:13.700
but he's never learned to
do anything for himself

06:13.920 --> 06:15.820
and I don't know why my
parents keep letting him

06:15.840 --> 06:17.100
trot all over them.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.700
Well, if your parents won't
stand up for themselves,

06:20.880 --> 06:22.920
maybe you need to
stand up for them.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.580
You know, you're right.

06:38.540 --> 06:39.990
Zephyr Breeze!

06:40.520 --> 06:43.400
Oh, hey sis! Come to see me work
my magic and turn this place

06:43.440 --> 06:47.580
from drab to fab, huh?
Well, watch and learn!

06:48.160 --> 06:50.020
Can't you see what
you're doing?

06:50.860 --> 06:53.040
Yeah, I'm getting
rid of this old stuff

06:53.080 --> 06:55.680
so I can turn the back
house into my art studio.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.560
I've decided I'm going
to be a sculptor!

06:59.040 --> 07:01.720
I'm talking about
Mom's flowers.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.660
She's gonna move them so I can
have my meditation patio here.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.420
She loves replanting
stuff, don't you, Mom?

07:10.540 --> 07:13.060
And Dad's been collecting
his favorite bits of cloud

07:13.100 --> 07:15.480
from the factory since
before you were born.

07:16.780 --> 07:19.260
The very best from
every production run

07:19.280 --> 07:21.030
since my first day
on the job.

07:23.580 --> 07:26.120
But why hold onto
the past, really?

07:26.800 --> 07:28.940
You can't just fly in
and change everything

07:28.980 --> 07:30.480
Mom and Dad have
built here.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.520
But this is the only
place big enough

07:32.560 --> 07:34.860
for my studio/meditation
garden.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.980
Ooh, unless I do it
in the living room!

07:38.880 --> 07:42.490
I know speaking up for yourself
can be hard, believe me.

07:42.780 --> 07:45.920
But Zephyr will never stand on
his own if he can lean on you.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.720
Don't be so
dramatic, sis.

07:49.100 --> 07:52.480
Mom and Dad just want
to let me be me, right?

07:52.960 --> 07:54.840
I can do plenty on my own.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.900
I agree. Which is why
you should move out.

07:59.140 --> 08:03.280
Oh. Well, I mean,
I totally would.

08:03.540 --> 08:06.680
But I don't think that's
what Mom and Dad want.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.380
It's not, is it?

08:10.280 --> 08:11.420
Uh...

08:11.720 --> 08:16.560
You know we love you, son.
But your sister has a point.

08:18.820 --> 08:22.840
Sure. I mean, I really
just came back here to keep

08:23.320 --> 08:27.200
you guys company. But
whatever's best for the family.

08:27.860 --> 08:30.320
I just...I just gotta
grab a few essentials.

08:31.460 --> 08:34.660
And you definitely have
somewhere else to go?

08:35.760 --> 08:38.620
Of course! There's plenty
of ponies who'd love

08:38.680 --> 08:40.860
for a little Breeze
to blow their way.

08:47.980 --> 08:50.140
So, where's Zeph
gonna go now?

08:50.240 --> 08:54.620
I'm not sure. Oh, I hope
I did the right thing.

08:54.860 --> 08:57.380
Are you kidding?
One hundred percent!

08:57.840 --> 09:03.580
Hey sis, your new
roomie's here!

09:04.540 --> 09:06.580
OK, maybe like
seventy percent.

09:10.460 --> 09:11.950
Um, Zephyr?

09:12.100 --> 09:14.480
When Mom and Dad told you to
find someplace else to live,

09:14.680 --> 09:16.160
I don't think
they meant here.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.800
Well, it's not
their house,

09:18.840 --> 09:21.360
so by definition
it's someplace else.

09:24.060 --> 09:27.800
Am I right, Rainbows? Stop
oogling me and help settle this.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.800
You know what? I totally
forgot that I promised

09:33.840 --> 09:36.700
to help Pinkie Pie...
sprinkle... something.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.720
You said you had
plenty of places to go.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.440
Fine! You can stay here--

09:46.520 --> 09:49.280
You're the best! We're
gonna have so much fun--

09:49.360 --> 09:51.320
--on one condition.

09:51.580 --> 09:52.990
Totally. Anything.

09:53.340 --> 09:54.800
You have to get a job.

09:56.440 --> 10:00.040
Crackin' the whip, huh? You
always were kinda bossy.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.620
Zephyr Breeze!

10:02.120 --> 10:04.220
Kidding! Get a
job. Absolutely.

10:12.940 --> 10:17.980
Where are
we going so early?

10:18.260 --> 10:22.640
You have no idea how bad
morning sun is for your mane.

10:22.940 --> 10:25.820
Remember how we talked
about you getting a job?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.960
It was just yesterday. And
it's totally on my to-do list.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.960
But you can't expect
me to find something

10:31.040 --> 10:33.480
befitting my
awesomeness overnight.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.180
I thought you might
say that.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.200
So I did it for you.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.400
What?

10:40.060 --> 10:43.120
These fabrics all need
to be dyed those colors.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.560
Do you think you
can handle that?

10:45.020 --> 10:47.280
Um...I don't know.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.420
You get started while
Fluttershy and I

10:49.460 --> 10:51.140
head to the store
for more supplies.

10:51.340 --> 10:52.160
Ta-ta!

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
Good luck!

11:02.200 --> 11:04.090
Thanks for giving
my brother a job.

11:04.420 --> 11:06.290
I just hope he's
up to the task.

11:06.420 --> 11:10.320
Oh darling, dyeing fabric
is the simplest thing.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.740
You just dip cloth
in a bowl.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.040
Rarity! You're back!

11:21.660 --> 11:23.220
What did you do?

11:23.500 --> 11:25.160
Since you talk to
animals all the time,

11:25.220 --> 11:26.620
I just figured it
runs in the family,

11:26.680 --> 11:29.580
so why not outsource
this stuff, you know?

11:30.920 --> 11:32.680
Turns out the animal
communication thing

11:32.720 --> 11:33.540
isn't genetic.

11:33.727 --> 11:36.995
Zephyr! I asked
you to do this job,

11:37.160 --> 11:39.840
not to pawn it off on
innocent woodland creatures.

11:40.960 --> 11:44.640
OK. I guess you have some
feelings about this,

11:44.800 --> 11:47.160
but you should know it's
basically your cat's fault

11:47.200 --> 11:49.270
for walking by and
giving me the idea.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.580
But I'm actually
kinda into this look.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.620
So, I guess what I'm saying
is... you're welcome.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.120
Wha-- Oh, uggh.

11:58.420 --> 12:01.260
Zephyr, this is
just unacceptable!

12:01.880 --> 12:06.460
Wow. I guess I know when my
efforts aren't appreciated!

12:12.380 --> 12:14.940
Whoa, those are tall.

12:15.340 --> 12:18.500
I'm glad you noticed because
they're your new job.

12:18.620 --> 12:19.340
Wha-?

12:19.500 --> 12:22.470
You said you were taking me
to tea with the princess.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.160
Actually, I said I was going
to tea with the princess.

12:26.340 --> 12:27.740
You're going to work.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.680
Sis, c'mon!

12:30.920 --> 12:32.900
Don't worry, Zephyr.
It'll be easy.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.540
I just need a Pegasus pony to
fly up and wipe each window down

12:36.600 --> 12:37.700
from top to bottom.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.840
And I'm here to make
sure you do it right!

12:47.000 --> 12:49.540
Wow, Zephyr, this
looks amazing!

12:49.620 --> 12:52.120
Well, you know, like
you said, it was easy.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.600
Where's Spike?

12:54.860 --> 12:55.940
<i> Up here!</i>

12:56.940 --> 12:59.840
You were supposed to supervise,
not do all the work.

13:00.020 --> 13:02.960
I was supervising! And
then Zephyr asked me about

13:03.000 --> 13:05.080
different cleaning techniques
and which one was best

13:05.180 --> 13:05.880
and if I could--

13:06.220 --> 13:08.080
Hey! I did all
the work.

13:09.340 --> 13:12.940
Don't let him fool you, ol'
Spike is quite the taskmaster.

13:17.820 --> 13:19.460
Oh, come on, sis.

13:19.620 --> 13:22.400
I had to ask Spike to make
sure I was doing it right.

13:22.620 --> 13:24.700
You didn't do it at all!

13:26.800 --> 13:30.240
Well, I guarantee there
won't be any fooling around

13:30.280 --> 13:31.640
on the next job.

13:31.780 --> 13:32.540
Next job?

13:34.860 --> 13:38.480
That's right, Zeph.
You're coming with me.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.640
You don't have to come
up with some excuse

13:40.700 --> 13:42.300
to hang out with
me, Rainbows.

13:42.580 --> 13:46.600
Let's just go for a fly and
see where the day takes us.

13:47.480 --> 13:51.320
Ugh, we're going to
Wonderbolts' Headquarters

13:51.480 --> 13:55.400
and I am going to give you a job
so simple and straightforward,

13:55.560 --> 13:58.340
not even you can weasel
your way out of it.

13:58.660 --> 13:59.460
And the second you try,

13:59.500 --> 14:01.460
I'm going to zap you with
a storm cloud. Got it?

14:01.840 --> 14:06.340
Oh, I got it. I can already feel
the electricity between us.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.050
Rainbow
Dash is crazy, OK?

14:16.140 --> 14:19.060
She expects me to do stuff right
when she asks me to do it!

14:19.200 --> 14:20.050
It's insane!

14:20.400 --> 14:22.460
So you just quit? Again?

14:23.060 --> 14:24.640
Escaped is more like it.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.260
Besides, what was
I supposed to do?

14:27.460 --> 14:30.230
Keep trying? Finish
something for once?

14:30.460 --> 14:33.600
Maybe that way, you'd actually
find something you like to do.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.340
That all sounds fine for your
friends, but it's just not me.

14:38.180 --> 14:41.580
Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I
don't think you can live here.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.620
Fine. I'll just go
live in the woods

14:46.680 --> 14:48.260
like my foreponies before me.

14:53.900 --> 14:56.920
Guess the only breeze this
Zephyr can count on is his own.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.820
Aww cheer up, Fluttershy.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.920
I know it was hard, but
you did the right thing.

15:11.180 --> 15:13.780
You couldn't let Zephyr
pull the same stuff on you

15:13.840 --> 15:15.410
that he's always
pulled on your folks.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.080
I guess so.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.820
Oh, hello Constance.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.460
Oh? Oh, dear.

15:26.300 --> 15:30.240
See, Wigford, The Breeze needs
nopony. We've got food...

15:30.320 --> 15:31.480
Shelter...

15:31.540 --> 15:33.320
Just need to put
the ol' kettle on.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.440
Come on, stickie-stickie
make with the sparks.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.920
Ugh! What's a pony gotta do to
find a decent stick around here?

15:59.040 --> 16:02.180
I know he needs to learn to
do things for himself, but...

16:02.300 --> 16:05.160
I can't let him
live like this.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.520
Actually, I don't think he'd
make it through the night.

16:14.780 --> 16:19.500
Fluttershy! Hey! I was just, um,
cozying up in my sleeping bag.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.640
Ready to call it
an early night.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.540
Such an exhausting
day, you know?

16:26.840 --> 16:28.260
It's noon.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.940
You know me: siesta!

16:34.740 --> 16:38.080
UGH! I can't do this.
I can't do anything.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.440
Zephyr, you're
smart and talented.

16:41.620 --> 16:44.300
You could do anything
if you just tried.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.180
And what if I give everything
I have and still fail?

16:47.580 --> 16:49.960
Honestly, I think it's
better not to try at all.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.740
But then you won't
ever do anything.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.640
I don't expect you
two to understand.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.200
I mean, when have
you ever failed?

16:58.400 --> 17:01.180
You've literally helped save
Equestria, like, a dozen times.

17:01.860 --> 17:04.550
And I was worried that
I'd fail every time.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.460
Sometimes you have to do things
even though you might fail.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.440
But failing is the worst!

17:10.860 --> 17:13.760
And quitting doesn't feel
much better, does it?
No.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.720
So here's the deal: You
can come back with me,

17:16.780 --> 17:20.200
but you have to do exactly
what I say, no exceptions.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.820
I will literally do
anything you ask me

17:25.120 --> 17:27.440
if it means I don't
have to stay here.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.480
OK, you know what you
have to do, right?

17:33.740 --> 17:36.240
Beg for help, then quit
when I get frustrated.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.480
Just kidding. Total
opposite of that. Got it.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.480
You think he can do it?

I did it. I actually finished
something. By myself.

19:52.980 --> 19:54.940
And it looks exactly
like it's supposed to.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.220
I knew you could do
it, Zephyr.

19:57.380 --> 19:58.140
I didn't!

19:58.700 --> 20:02.100
But I do now. Thanks, for
believing in me, sis.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.300
That's what big
sisters are for.

20:05.960 --> 20:10.300
So, Zeph, now that you've
accomplished this, what's next?

20:10.460 --> 20:14.520
Anything I want! I mean,
the sky's the limit, right?

20:16.840 --> 20:20.640
But, you know, I've got
some baby steps in mind.

20:22.220 --> 20:26.040
Thanks for dinner, Mr. and Mrs.
Shy. It was great, as usual.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.600
Thank you, dear, for
not giving up on Zephyr.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.100
After all these years
of pining for him,

20:32.300 --> 20:35.900
it must be so satisfying to
see him on the right track.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.600
Have you heard from
Zephyr? Is he doing well?

20:40.980 --> 20:43.140
I tell you, he's
a brand new pony.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.570
So full of drive
and determination.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.500
That's great.

20:47.600 --> 20:51.860
Guess who graduated from
mane therapy training?

20:55.060 --> 20:56.060
Awesome!

20:56.500 --> 20:58.300
Congratulations, son.

20:59.980 --> 21:02.300
You look so handsome!

21:02.680 --> 21:04.620
I'm so proud of
you, Zephyr.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.440
It was only a
matter of time

21:06.480 --> 21:09.100
before they recognized
my true genius.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.340
But actually doing the
work probably helped.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.560
And I wouldn't have
if it weren't for you.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.880
Oh I just gave you
some encouragement;

21:19.180 --> 21:20.680
you did this on your own.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.120
And honestly, right now I
feel like I can do anything.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.000
Except find a place.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.000
I can still crash here
for a few days, right?
