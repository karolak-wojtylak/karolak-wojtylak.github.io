00:08.410 --> 00:11.070
Spike, you really need
to go to sleep.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.330
Two more minutes, Twilight?

00:13.440 --> 00:15.080
I'm just getting to
the really good part.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.480
The Mane-iac is about to--

00:16.490 --> 00:17.600
The Mane-iac?

00:17.650 --> 00:20.410
The Power Ponies'
most evil nemesis.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.470
She was the power-mad owner
of a hair-care product company.

00:23.620 --> 00:26.640
A tragic accident at her shampoo
factory in Maretropolis

00:26.650 --> 00:28.940
not only gave her mane
strange new powers,

00:29.110 --> 00:31.300
but also caused her to go...

00:31.310 --> 00:34.720
...completely insane!

00:34.730 --> 00:37.460
She and her henchponies
are planning to break into

00:37.470 --> 00:40.720
the Maretropolis Museum
and steal the Electro-Orb

00:40.730 --> 00:43.370
so she can use it to power
up her doomsday device.

00:43.550 --> 00:45.790
Of course, the Mane-iac
wouldn't have even known

00:45.810 --> 00:49.300
if Hum Drum hadn't slipped
up and told her all about it.

00:49.990 --> 00:50.880
Hum Drum?

00:51.140 --> 00:53.820
Guy in the blue boots
and pointless red cape.

00:53.990 --> 00:57.240
The Power Ponies' bumbling
and totally useless side-kick.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.490
The Power Ponies have
to stop the Mane-iac

00:59.500 --> 01:02.600
or Mare-tropolis is doomed!

01:03.310 --> 01:06.040
Believe me, Spike, if anypony
understands what it's like

01:06.050 --> 01:08.340
to get caught up in a
really good book, it's me.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.550
But if we're going to make
any progress fixing up

01:10.560 --> 01:12.520
Luna and Celestia's old
castle tomorrow,

01:12.640 --> 01:14.290
we all have to
do our part.

01:14.620 --> 01:16.420
We don't want to be too
tired to lend a hoof.

01:16.970 --> 01:17.810
Or claw.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.120
OK. OK. I'm going to bed.

01:21.200 --> 01:21.900
Good-night.

01:35.730 --> 01:36.910
Two more minutes.

01:37.770 --> 01:38.970
Yes!

01:47.230 --> 01:51.500

02:21.660 --> 02:22.810
Looking good, everypony!

02:22.820 --> 02:25.110
Let's keep this magical
make-over moving.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.200
You got it.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.270
Good ol' Spike is here
ready to do his part.

02:34.570 --> 02:36.130
A little more to the left!

02:36.730 --> 02:38.020
No, the other left!

02:39.030 --> 02:40.340
Awesome! That's perfect
right where it is!

02:40.350 --> 02:41.800
On to the next painting.

02:42.650 --> 02:43.980
You sure you don't
need any help?

02:44.210 --> 02:45.380
Naw. That's OK.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.040
We've got everything
under control!

02:47.770 --> 02:48.650
Dash?

02:48.820 --> 02:49.700
I'm good.

02:51.430 --> 02:54.180
Isn't there anything
I can help you with, Twilight?

02:54.530 --> 02:56.400
Don't worry about it
Spike; it's all good.

02:56.590 --> 02:57.660
I think she's right.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.280
It looks like we've
got it, Spike.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.840
Looking great, everypony!

03:02.460 --> 03:05.060
Why don't you find a quiet spot
and finish reading your comic?

03:05.450 --> 03:06.270
Weren't you right at the part

03:06.280 --> 03:08.220
where Hum Drum was about
to stop the villain?

03:10.390 --> 03:12.850
Hum Drum never
stops the villain.

03:13.130 --> 03:14.790
He's just there
for comic relief.

03:23.020 --> 03:25.100
Rarity, let me give
you a hoof with that.

03:25.450 --> 03:26.390
I could do it.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.770
That's OK, Spike.

03:28.050 --> 03:30.940
<i>Pony Power!</i>
<i>Wheeee!</i>

03:37.500 --> 03:39.390
Mane-iac breaks
into the museum...

03:39.400 --> 03:40.780
OK. Here we go.

03:43.730 --> 03:47.160
What a surprise, Hum
Drum is in the way again

03:47.170 --> 03:48.950
while the Power Ponies
do all the work.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.760
I guess I know what
that feels like.

03:53.930 --> 03:54.630
Wait.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.030
What? How can
that be the end?

03:59.200 --> 04:00.970
What's that?

04:01.250 --> 04:02.940
You can retry.

04:04.030 --> 04:06.520
What? You can return.

04:09.990 --> 04:12.630
I know I saw a magnifying
glass lying around

04:12.640 --> 04:13.720
last time I was here.

04:15.270 --> 04:18.050
<i>Spike! Where are ya,</i>
<i>Spike!</i>

04:18.250 --> 04:20.350
<i>We're breaking for</i>
<i>tea and biscuits!</i>

04:20.520 --> 04:21.520
<i>Spike!</i>

04:22.560 --> 04:26.730
You can return to the
place you started

04:26.830 --> 04:29.900
when the Mane-iac
is defeated.

04:30.530 --> 04:31.270
Huh?

04:35.930 --> 04:38.100
Take a closer look...

04:38.290 --> 04:40.940
...to join the
adventure in this book?

04:41.200 --> 04:42.290
What does that even mean?

04:43.350 --> 04:46.180
Whoa! Cool!

04:48.000 --> 04:49.470
Spike! What are you--

04:52.490 --> 04:54.720
Help!

04:55.180 --> 04:56.110
Spike!

05:11.970 --> 05:13.160
Wheee!

05:21.750 --> 05:24.960
Is this Maretropolis?

05:28.330 --> 05:31.250
<i>Somepony wanna tell</i>
<i>me what the hay is going on?</i>

05:33.020 --> 05:34.810
Holy new
personas, ponies!

05:35.770 --> 05:38.550
<i>You're the Masked Matter-Horn.</i>

05:39.660 --> 05:40.940
<i>Fili-Second.</i>

05:41.340 --> 05:42.560
<i>Zapp.</i>

05:42.860 --> 05:44.290
<i>R... Radiance.</i>

05:45.050 --> 05:46.760
<i>Mistress Mare-velous.</i>

05:47.320 --> 05:49.260
<i>Saddle Rager.</i>

05:50.490 --> 05:52.630
You're the Power Ponies!

05:59.650 --> 06:01.300
Power Ponies!

06:02.470 --> 06:04.710
How kind of you to join us.

06:05.140 --> 06:05.930
Huh?

06:18.600 --> 06:21.260
Did she just call
us "Power Ponies"?

06:21.390 --> 06:22.480
You're the...

06:22.490 --> 06:24.740
the superheroes
from my comic book.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.590
It somehow zapped
us all in here.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.890
So somepony zap us
back out.

06:29.330 --> 06:30.720
My comic book...

06:30.910 --> 06:32.740
It said the way to get
back to where we started

06:32.750 --> 06:34.220
was to defeat the Mane-iac.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.690
Your arch-nemesis.

06:37.470 --> 06:40.860
Time for the mane event!

06:50.560 --> 06:52.270
<i>Pinkie! Where'd she go?</i>

06:52.350 --> 06:54.950
Wheeeeeee!

06:55.290 --> 06:57.130
She could be miles
away from here by now.

06:57.220 --> 06:58.490
Pinkie is Filli-Second,

06:58.590 --> 07:01.020
the fastest pony in
all of Maretropolis.

07:18.780 --> 07:20.430
Twilight, freeze her mane!

07:20.820 --> 07:21.880
Do what?

07:22.050 --> 07:23.530
You're the Masked Matter-horn.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.400
You can shoot all kinds of crazy
power beams from your horn!

07:33.630 --> 07:37.090
You know, I'm beginning
to enjoy this.

07:41.660 --> 07:42.550
Dash, quick!

07:42.560 --> 07:44.590
You're Zapp and your
super-power is controlling

07:44.600 --> 07:46.030
the mighty forces of nature!

07:46.190 --> 07:47.930
Unholster the lightning bolt!

08:01.580 --> 08:03.230
Lightning! Not a tornado!

08:27.710 --> 08:29.490
Fluttershy, you're Saddle Rager!

08:29.500 --> 08:31.390
Lose your temper
and you'll turn into a huge,

08:31.400 --> 08:32.840
super-strong monster!

08:33.050 --> 08:36.760
Oh. Gosh. That wouldn't
be very polite.

08:37.890 --> 08:41.140
Rarity, use your jewelry
to create attack constructs.

08:41.450 --> 08:43.100
What's an attack construct?

08:43.370 --> 08:45.410
Just think of
something... anything...

08:45.420 --> 08:46.940
and your bracelet
makes it appear.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.590
Something useful!

09:01.890 --> 09:03.090
The Electro-Orb!

09:04.980 --> 09:07.550
Well, this has been quite the

09:07.630 --> 09:10.380
mane-raising experience,

09:10.550 --> 09:12.760
but I really must be going.

09:20.190 --> 09:23.600
Why, thank you, Hum Drum.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.580
I'm Hum Drum?

09:33.970 --> 09:34.830
Oh, no!

09:40.880 --> 09:43.270
Applejack! You gotta
help stop the tornado

09:43.280 --> 09:44.750
from destroying the city!

09:44.760 --> 09:48.790
But every time I move, this
darn lasso gets tighter.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.640
You're psychically
connected to it.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.370
Will it to where you
want it to go...

09:53.510 --> 09:54.590
and it'll obey you.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.120
Haha, That was spintastic!

10:13.400 --> 10:14.790
Let me get this straight.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.800
We've been sucked
into some kind of...

10:17.250 --> 10:18.530
comic book world?

10:18.540 --> 10:20.840
Technically,
it's called Maretropolis.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.780
And if we want to get
back to Ponyville,

10:22.790 --> 10:24.140
I think we have to
stop the Mane-iac

10:24.150 --> 10:26.420
from using her doomsday
device to destroy it.

10:26.570 --> 10:28.830
No biggie. I was
already awesome.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.750
And now we've all
got super powers.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.810
Almost all of us
have super powers.

10:33.820 --> 10:35.870
But you must have
them too, Spikey-boo,

10:35.880 --> 10:37.470
your character is
wearing a cape.

10:37.780 --> 10:40.520
Yeah. For absolutely
no reason.

10:40.650 --> 10:42.670
He's pretty much useless.

10:44.390 --> 10:46.430
Good thing you're not
really Hum Drum then.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.780
Yeah. Good thing.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.870
So the six of us "Power Ponies"
will take care of Mane-iac

10:52.880 --> 10:54.300
and get us back to Ponyville.

10:54.580 --> 10:57.980
Spike, where is the Mane-iac
building her doomsday device?

10:58.170 --> 10:59.910
Her top secret headquarters.

11:00.030 --> 11:01.200
But you'd better
get there quick.

11:01.210 --> 11:03.300
That glowing orb she just stole
is what she's going to use

11:03.310 --> 11:04.340
to power it up.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.040
Lead the way, Spike.

11:06.530 --> 11:08.630
Then leave the rest to us.

11:16.980 --> 11:17.860
<i>There it is.</i>

11:18.160 --> 11:20.860
Is that a... shampoo factory?

11:21.490 --> 11:23.810
All right, Power Ponies,
here's the plan.

11:24.070 --> 11:25.130
Rarity, you, me and--

11:25.140 --> 11:27.020
<i>Come on out,</i>
<i>Mane-iac!</i>

11:27.390 --> 11:30.280
Or the Power Ponies
are coming in.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.510
So much for
element of surprise.

11:34.990 --> 11:38.050
Guess I'll just hang back
here doing nothing.

11:39.670 --> 11:41.450
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>she's home.</i>

11:41.460 --> 11:43.350
Maybe we should just
come back later.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.500
She's home.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.850
Time to "Power Pony Up".

11:53.070 --> 11:55.690
Oooh. Nice catchphrase.

11:57.940 --> 11:59.010
Freeze Ray!

12:04.430 --> 12:05.660
It's an improvement, darling.

12:21.620 --> 12:23.230
Hee hee hee! Ha ha!

12:34.150 --> 12:36.870
Oh, I do so love a
functional accessory.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.070
My hair!

12:45.950 --> 12:46.910
Seriously?

12:47.060 --> 12:50.190
You aren't even just a
little angry right now?

12:51.110 --> 12:52.630
<i>Nice work,</i>
<i>Power Ponies.</i>

12:52.840 --> 12:56.020
Now let's take care of the
Mane-iac and get ourselves home.

12:56.140 --> 12:58.430
I don't think so.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.600
I have a city to destroy.

13:00.870 --> 13:04.890
And I'm not about to let
the Power Ponies stop me.

13:05.010 --> 13:07.060
Not this time.

13:07.170 --> 13:08.740
Just watch us.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.070
The Hair Spray Ray of Doom!

13:12.080 --> 13:14.760
It stops you in your tracks
and renders your powers useless!

13:21.460 --> 13:23.510
We'll just see about that.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.700
Fluttershy, please!

13:43.030 --> 13:44.320
Just a little anger?

13:44.410 --> 13:47.300
Well, I'm not so much
angry as I'm concerned,

13:47.310 --> 13:49.000
bordering on terrified.

13:53.390 --> 13:54.610
Don't spray!

13:57.560 --> 14:00.960
Oh, Hum Drum, why in
all of Mare-tropolis

14:00.970 --> 14:04.080
would I use the Hair
Spray Ray of Doom on you?

14:04.250 --> 14:06.160
Rather pointless,
don't you think?

14:22.640 --> 14:26.070
<i>What am I supposed</i>
<i>to do? I'm useless.</i>

14:26.080 --> 14:28.810
No wonder my friends never need
<i>me to do anything important.</i>

14:28.820 --> 14:31.080
<i>They're the ones with</i>
<i>the super powers.</i>

14:31.090 --> 14:33.920
They've probably already
figured out how to escape.

14:39.460 --> 14:40.690
Or not.

14:55.260 --> 14:58.180
Congratulations, Power Ponies.

14:59.340 --> 15:03.410
You shall live just long
enough to see me fire ...

15:05.540 --> 15:08.580
the instrument of
your destruction!

15:10.920 --> 15:14.340
Once the Electro-Orb
has powered it up completely,

15:14.350 --> 15:18.600
this cannon will amplify
the power of my mane

15:18.610 --> 15:21.430
one million times,

15:21.440 --> 15:22.960
<i>expelling an energy blast</i>

15:22.970 --> 15:26.280
<i>that will cause everypony</i>
<i>in Mare-tropolis' mane</i>

15:26.290 --> 15:28.170
<i>to grow wild!</i>

15:30.500 --> 15:33.570
You will be my weapon's
first victims,

15:33.580 --> 15:38.280
<i>and there is nopony who can</i>
<i>save you from this fate!</i>

15:44.020 --> 15:44.980
<i>Ahem.</i>

15:45.200 --> 15:46.560
I don't mean to interrupt,

15:46.570 --> 15:49.450
but aren't you forgetting
about somepony?

15:49.720 --> 15:51.490
Hum Drum? Little guy?

15:51.500 --> 15:53.750
No superpowers whatsoever?

15:55.230 --> 15:57.050
He's utterly useless.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.090
Please! Everypony knows you
just keep him around

16:04.100 --> 16:06.770
because you feel
sorry for him.

16:06.780 --> 16:08.850
Wah Wah!

16:09.640 --> 16:11.060
Maybe in your world.

16:11.070 --> 16:14.110
But in our world
Spike- uh, Hum Drum,

16:14.120 --> 16:15.860
always comes through
when we need him.

16:16.220 --> 16:17.220
Always.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.810
I'm not like Hum Drum.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.570
When my friends really
need me, I do come through.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.630
And they need me now.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.350
I see dementia
must be a side-effect

16:32.360 --> 16:35.850
of prolonged exposure to
the Hair Spray Ray of Doom.

16:37.230 --> 16:41.430
Tonight we stand upon the
brink of immortality,

16:41.440 --> 16:45.510
for we collectively -
though mostly me -

16:45.520 --> 16:49.600
<i>have finally defeated our</i>
<i>most hated nemeses.</i>

16:49.610 --> 16:52.120
<i>We have hurled the</i>
<i>brush of badness</i>

16:52.130 --> 16:54.750
into the now fearful face of...

16:56.170 --> 16:59.980
<i>goodness, and have struck</i>
<i>a blow for freedom,</i>

16:59.990 --> 17:01.890
<i>in the name of oppression!</i>

17:01.900 --> 17:05.570
And nothing will stop us!

17:23.100 --> 17:24.610
Way to go, Spike!

17:36.810 --> 17:37.990
Get mad!

17:38.000 --> 17:39.160
I'm trying.

17:39.170 --> 17:40.410
Grrrr.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.000
Tag! You're it.

17:47.040 --> 17:47.750
Tag! You're it.

17:47.790 --> 17:48.530
Tag! You're it.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.510
Tag! You're it!

17:49.830 --> 17:51.020
Over there!

17:51.310 --> 17:53.900
There, THERE! IDIOTS!

18:13.670 --> 18:16.270
Need a place to put these guys!

18:29.490 --> 18:31.370
Hold it right there, partner.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.400
Fluttershy, where are you going?

18:51.140 --> 18:53.290
You seem to have
everything under control.

18:53.670 --> 18:55.010
Fluttershy, we need you!

18:55.020 --> 18:56.380
<i>You have to power up.</i>

18:58.020 --> 18:58.990
I'm sorry.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.270
It's just that nothing
is making me mad.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.460
Oh, goodness.

19:09.770 --> 19:10.890
Are you OK?

19:12.620 --> 19:14.670
Are you kidding me?

19:14.680 --> 19:17.490
I mean, I know you're evil
and everything.

19:17.500 --> 19:22.790
but you'd hurt a teensy, little
harmless fire fly? Really?

19:22.800 --> 19:26.680
<i>WHY, YOU'RE JUST A</i>
<i>GREAT BIG... MEANIE!</i>

19:26.690 --> 19:29.170
THERE, I SAID IT!

19:29.180 --> 19:32.080
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU'RE SO SPECIAL?

19:32.090 --> 19:35.520
LIKE THE RULES OF COMMON
COURTESY DON'T APPLY TO YOU?

19:35.530 --> 19:40.170
WHY DON'T YOU PICK
ON SOMEBODY YOUR OWN SIZE!

20:01.940 --> 20:02.910
Huh?

20:05.750 --> 20:07.280
<i>My mane!</i>

20:07.280 --> 20:11.520
My mane!

20:17.680 --> 20:20.330
Once again, the
day is saved by--

20:34.900 --> 20:37.540
Did you see how I was raining
down a storm of justice

20:37.550 --> 20:38.420
at the end there?

20:38.430 --> 20:40.600
You catch how I was
wieldin' that lasso?

20:40.790 --> 20:41.750
Cupcakes?

20:42.150 --> 20:43.290
How did you--?

20:43.300 --> 20:45.200
We had a good half-second before
we got sucked back out

20:45.210 --> 20:46.990
of the comic and The
Mare-tropolis bakery

20:47.000 --> 20:49.090
was only 65 blocks away.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.440
I'm just glad to be back.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.560
We wouldn't have made
it without you, Spike.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.050
And I hope you realize

20:55.060 --> 20:57.050
that just because we don't
always need your help,

20:57.060 --> 20:59.310
it doesn't mean that we
don't think you're helpful.

20:59.990 --> 21:01.880
And that you don't have
to have super powers

21:01.890 --> 21:03.300
to be a super friend.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.510
But I do have one question.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.170
Where exactly did you
get that comic book?

21:09.480 --> 21:12.080
This one I got in Canterlot at
The House of Enchanted Comics.

21:14.990 --> 21:17.940
Well, I didn't know it meant
they were literally enchanted.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.780
I thought it just meant like,
the comics they sold there

21:22.790 --> 21:24.450
had really enchanting
story lines.

21:26.010 --> 21:29.760
Hey wait up! I'm an important
part of this team; remember?
