00:06.849 --> 00:09.446
Good morning, Miss Cheerilee!

00:09.587 --> 00:11.126
Good morning, everypony!

00:11.347 --> 00:13.107
I hope you brought
your thinking caps

00:13.316 --> 00:16.363
because today we're going
to learn about physics!

00:17.883 --> 00:18.904
Physics?

00:19.132 --> 00:24.092
Mm-hm. Specifically, the use of
force in energy conversions.

00:24.393 --> 00:28.006
In this case, using mechanical
work to convert potential energy

00:28.043 --> 00:29.464
into kinetic energy.

00:30.166 --> 00:31.181
The what, now?

00:31.427 --> 00:35.243
Um. Mrs. Cheerilee, that
sounds a bit over our heads.

00:35.815 --> 00:38.406
Yeah. Why would we even
need to know that stuff?

00:38.590 --> 00:40.092
Oh, it's very important.

00:40.178 --> 00:43.932
In fact, you'll most likely
end up using it tomorrow.

00:44.233 --> 00:46.006
Tomorrow? What for?

00:46.258 --> 00:48.707
Why, for participating in the ...

00:49.261 --> 00:51.107
APPLEWOOD DERBY!

00:56.978 --> 01:00.670
Oh, WHEW! For a second I
thought we were gonna have to

01:00.898 --> 01:02.818
You know... learn stuff.

01:09.303 --> 01:14.300

01:42.769 --> 01:47.390
We get to race in the Applewood
Derby tomorrow? That's so cool!

01:47.520 --> 01:49.366
My family's talked
about it for years

01:49.403 --> 01:51.833
and now I'm finally
old enough to race!

01:53.138 --> 01:56.018
Now hold onto your
horseshoes, everypony.

01:56.227 --> 01:59.218
You've got a lot of work to do
before you're ready to race.

01:59.643 --> 02:02.203
Yeah, but not
school work, right?

02:03.723 --> 02:06.203
There'll be a block of
applewood just like this one

02:06.227 --> 02:08.590
waiting for you at Sweet
Apple Acres tomorrow

02:08.732 --> 02:12.424
and you've got one day to turn
it into a race-ready cart.

02:12.683 --> 02:14.701
Awwwwww!

02:14.892 --> 02:17.741
Oh, yeah. That is
a lot of work.

02:18.246 --> 02:22.006
Mm-hmm. Luckily, you'll each
get to pick an older pony

02:22.030 --> 02:24.744
to help you. But
choose wisely

02:24.910 --> 02:27.046
because they'll also
have to ride in the cart

02:27.070 --> 02:28.326
with you during the race.

02:29.427 --> 02:32.806
Hmm, I think I know
just the pony to ask!

02:32.916 --> 02:33.852
Me too!

02:33.907 --> 02:34.941
Me three!

02:36.640 --> 02:39.310
Just remember everypony,
your cart has to be able

02:39.335 --> 02:42.326
to finish the race if you want
to win one of the awards.

02:43.181 --> 02:45.987
Fastest, for winning
the race, naturally.

02:46.381 --> 02:49.120
Most Traditional, for
the best working replica

02:49.156 --> 02:51.021
of an original Applewood cart.

02:51.286 --> 02:55.532
And Most Creative, for the cart
with the best overall design.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.387
Hoo-eee! Those ribbons
are the bees' knees.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.049
Uh-huh!

03:02.080 --> 03:04.301
All right then, class.
You've got a lot to learn

03:04.332 --> 03:05.723
if you want to
build a race cart.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.729
Oh. I knew there was
gonna be a catch.

03:16.861 --> 03:19.286
Wow, have you seen what the
carts used to look like

03:19.310 --> 03:20.381
in the olden days?

03:21.507 --> 03:23.507
Yeah. I know all about them.

03:23.895 --> 03:25.421
When Ponyville
started the derby,

03:25.550 --> 03:26.800
they decided to
use the wood

03:26.867 --> 03:28.572
from our apple trees
for the carts.

03:28.812 --> 03:32.203
The race has been a part of
Sweet Apple Acres ever since.

03:32.467 --> 03:35.169
I just think these old
carts look so cool.

03:35.470 --> 03:38.209
But I guess you and Applejack
will probably win the award

03:38.227 --> 03:39.655
for most traditional, huh?

03:40.116 --> 03:42.326
The Apples usually
do, but honestly,

03:42.566 --> 03:45.292
I'd rather build the fastest
cart there is and win the race!

03:49.052 --> 03:50.929
But I'm pretty sure
Scoot and Rainbow Dash

03:50.953 --> 03:51.852
will take that award.

03:52.012 --> 03:54.344
You know, I race around
so much on my scooter,

03:54.553 --> 03:58.067
being the fastest isn't such
a big deal. Maybe I'll try

03:58.086 --> 04:00.436
to make the wildest-looking
cart I can think of.

04:00.916 --> 04:01.538
Really?

04:01.692 --> 04:03.636
Sure. If I win
Most Creative,

04:03.852 --> 04:06.227
you can totally win
the award for Fastest.

04:06.338 --> 04:08.596
And I can win the award
for Most Traditional!

04:08.775 --> 04:11.175
Sounds like we're all going
to try something different.

04:11.390 --> 04:12.880
I can't wait to
tell Applejack!

04:13.175 --> 04:14.406
Let's get to it!

04:14.523 --> 04:17.378
GOOOOO CRUSADERS!

04:19.489 --> 04:23.433
Are you kidding! Of course I'll
help with the Applewood Derby!

04:23.538 --> 04:26.400
I want you to have as much fun
as I did when I was a filly.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.984
Wait, Cloudsdale
has a derby too?

04:29.427 --> 04:32.467
Sure! Practically every
town in Equestria has one.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.578
I still remember
racing my cloud cart.

04:37.796 --> 04:41.661
THIS. IS. SO. AWESOME!

04:43.113 --> 04:46.560
WHOOHOOOOO!

04:49.230 --> 04:52.855
And let me guess...
You won Fastest Cart.

04:54.030 --> 04:55.156
Obviously!

04:55.409 --> 04:58.627
So what do you say? Will you
help me make my race cart?

04:58.806 --> 05:02.289
Help you? I'm ALL OVER IT.
I've got tons of ideas.

05:04.160 --> 05:07.858
Don't worry, I've got a
lot of ideas of my own.

05:08.055 --> 05:09.821
Um, what are you looking for?

05:10.141 --> 05:12.332
The blueprint for my
Derby cart, of course.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.070
I'll have to change it a little
cause this race is on roads,

05:15.113 --> 05:19.784
not on clouds, but trust me,
your cart is gonna be AMAZING!

05:20.467 --> 05:22.787
Um, OK, Rainbow Dash, thanks!

05:23.144 --> 05:24.861
How awesome is THIS?

05:24.916 --> 05:27.833
With Dash on my team, how
could anything go wrong?

05:29.809 --> 05:31.606
Heh, well I'm mighty
flattered you wanna work

05:31.661 --> 05:33.150
with your big sis on your cart.

05:33.224 --> 05:35.015
I mean, the "Applewood
Derby" did...

05:35.052 --> 05:36.867
...start on our farm. I know.

05:37.255 --> 05:39.655
Well, I couldn't be more proud
to help my little sister

05:39.698 --> 05:41.815
take the prize for
"Most Traditional!"

05:42.492 --> 05:46.947
Actually I was kinda thinkin' of
somethin' else. Like fastest?

05:48.135 --> 05:51.181
"Fastest?" Apple Bloom,
things aren't like they were

05:51.212 --> 05:52.116
in the old days.

05:52.221 --> 05:55.163
The fastest cart now has gotta
be slick and modern and...

05:55.206 --> 05:55.944
Exactly!

05:56.153 --> 06:00.092
...not Apple at all. The
Apples win Most Traditional.

06:00.412 --> 06:02.006
We have since the Derby started!

06:02.646 --> 06:04.763
Why would anypony want
to win anything else?

06:05.206 --> 06:07.741
Now, why don't you head off
and get some chamomile vines,

06:07.840 --> 06:09.544
some hickory sticks,
and some apple barrels

06:09.704 --> 06:12.578
and I'll show you what an Apple
Family cart should look like.

06:13.526 --> 06:15.901
I guess I do have a family
tradition to uphold.

06:17.218 --> 06:22.073
THE APPLEWOOD DERBY?
Of course I'll help!

06:22.313 --> 06:25.520
Wow, uh, Rarity, I didn't
know you'd be this excited!

06:25.907 --> 06:28.387
Me? Oh why, I'm just itching
to right an old wrong

06:28.400 --> 06:29.710
from long, long ago.

06:30.683 --> 06:32.923
I designed my own cart
when I was just a filly.

06:33.144 --> 06:35.243
And I was positive I was
going to win the prize for

06:35.267 --> 06:36.996
"Most Creative," hooves down.

06:38.393 --> 06:41.409
But I came in second. Second!

06:43.476 --> 06:46.486
You? Second for Most
Creative? To whom?

06:52.233 --> 06:57.372
But I learned a valuable lesson.
I learned to know my audience.

06:57.513 --> 07:00.855
And the race cart audience
wants big! They want bold!

07:02.910 --> 07:06.301
Chop, chop, everypony
out! We've got work to do!

07:08.240 --> 07:10.535
This will take all of
my considerable skills,

07:11.796 --> 07:14.800
but I will fashion the biggest
and boldest derby cart

07:14.836 --> 07:17.310
to ever win the prize
for Most Creative!

07:17.532 --> 07:20.529
Actually, I was sort of
thinking of something more...

07:20.775 --> 07:21.772
traditional?

07:22.313 --> 07:25.464
Oh, ha ha! Oh please, darling,
leave tradition to the Apples.

07:25.581 --> 07:26.916
We're doing big and bold!

07:28.184 --> 07:31.323
Soon the prize for Most Creative
will finally be in my hooves!

07:32.190 --> 07:34.196
You mean MY hooves.

07:34.486 --> 07:35.938
Yes, that's what I
said "my hooves."

07:36.116 --> 07:39.089
Darling, I hope you're ready to
get an early start tomorrow.

07:40.135 --> 07:42.252
Uh, how early?

07:52.701 --> 07:58.289
Rarity, the sun's not even up yet!

07:58.443 --> 08:03.101
Oh, Apples, quit complaining. In
my day, we were up even earlier!

08:03.501 --> 08:05.643
Hey, I'd get up in the
middle of the night

08:05.716 --> 08:08.166
if it means my cart crosses
that finish line first

08:08.215 --> 08:09.464
and wins Fastest!

08:10.221 --> 08:12.418
And my cart wins Most Creative!

08:12.873 --> 08:14.843
And my cart wins
Most Traditional!

08:15.212 --> 08:17.907
Hoo-eee!, it's
gonna be a good day!

08:18.295 --> 08:20.233
You mean "our" carts, right?

08:20.381 --> 08:22.006
Yes, that what we said, darling!

08:22.233 --> 08:22.492
Yep!

08:22.695 --> 08:24.184
Our carts!

08:32.480 --> 08:35.138
"Their" carts? It almost
sounds like they're planning

08:35.156 --> 08:36.732
on building them without us.

08:36.867 --> 08:41.132
I'm sure they meant "our" carts,
like the team cart. Right?

08:41.464 --> 08:44.800
Of course! I mean they're
all our older sisters...

08:45.021 --> 08:45.796
practically.

08:46.141 --> 08:49.495
Plus they've all done this
before. I'm sure they know best.

08:50.246 --> 08:52.560
Let's just buckle
down and get to work.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.950
Scootaloo,
where have you been?

09:08.209 --> 09:10.960
I've only got till noon to
make the fastest cart ever.

09:12.024 --> 09:13.440
Uh, about that.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.658
I was really thinking of going
for the Most Creative prize.

09:16.820 --> 09:19.649
I mean, I know all about
speed already so...

09:19.680 --> 09:22.480
Exactly! It's all about speed.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.713
We've gotta get across the
finish line to win a prize,

09:24.775 --> 09:26.763
so we might as well
get there first, right?

09:27.156 --> 09:29.421
Hey, I left a bunch of
paint cans by the road.

09:29.550 --> 09:30.670
Bring them up here, would ya?

09:30.898 --> 09:33.064
Nothing as fun as
painting racing stripes

09:33.120 --> 09:34.658
on the winning cart!

09:34.873 --> 09:37.766
Right. Fun.

09:40.203 --> 09:42.861
Spendin' time building a
cart with my big sister,

09:43.126 --> 09:47.673
why this is just tee-riffic!
Um, how can I help?

09:47.895 --> 09:51.132
You can feast your
eyes on... this!

09:52.326 --> 09:54.381
I mean, it ain't
quite finished yet.

09:54.806 --> 09:56.504
Oh, good.

09:56.886 --> 09:59.821
But don't it have the makings of
the best cart you ever did see?

10:01.070 --> 10:03.698
Uh, is somethin'
wrong, Apple Bloom?

10:04.338 --> 10:06.400
Actually, I was kinda
thinking of something

10:06.430 --> 10:08.996
a little more modern.
And less rickety.

10:10.233 --> 10:12.043
With maybe a chance of winning.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.960
Bless my hooves, I
thought we covered this!

10:15.378 --> 10:19.101
Tradition is all that counts
and who knows tradition better

10:19.126 --> 10:21.649
than Apples? Nopony! That's who!

10:21.852 --> 10:25.175
So are you an Apple
or are you an Apple?

10:25.710 --> 10:29.409
I'm an Apple. But, what if I
just take off this fringe.

10:29.470 --> 10:30.578
NO! NOT THE FRINGE!

10:33.366 --> 10:36.621
Why, shoot, now I've gotta
start all over from scratch!

10:36.855 --> 10:38.215
And it's almost race time.

10:38.670 --> 10:42.110
Oh! So maybe we can redesign
it then... just a little.

10:42.553 --> 10:45.033
No time! And who'd want
to redesign something

10:45.058 --> 10:46.707
that's already perfect?

10:47.156 --> 10:49.064
Right. Perfect.

10:50.793 --> 10:53.206
OK, so I sketched
out some of my ideas.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.526
How about a nice
yellow fringe on top?

10:55.723 --> 10:59.753
Oh-ho, darling, the
fringe is not exactly big.

11:00.030 --> 11:03.138
And that yellow is the least
bold color I can imagine.

11:03.581 --> 11:05.495
Well, it doesn't
have to be yellow.

11:05.655 --> 11:08.781
But I really do love the
old-timey style. Like this!

11:11.692 --> 11:13.815
Sweetie Belle, precious face.

11:13.969 --> 11:16.855
"Old-Timey" is just
another word for passé!

11:17.181 --> 11:21.403
Remember, BIG and BOLD! I do
have a reputation to uphold!

11:21.723 --> 11:23.427
It was one thing
to lose as a filly,

11:23.692 --> 11:27.076
but can you imagine if I didn't
win the Most Creative now?

11:27.360 --> 11:29.587
Ponies might stop
buying my couture!

11:30.492 --> 11:33.089
But we're supposed to
be doing this together!

11:33.286 --> 11:34.929
Yes, of course we are, darling.

11:35.298 --> 11:38.412
In fact, we just
finished! Voila!

11:40.055 --> 11:41.464
I know. You're speechless.

11:42.215 --> 11:45.107
But if that isn't big and
bold, I don't know what is.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.107
Isn't it wonderful?

11:48.067 --> 11:50.596
Right. Wonderful.

13:10.609 --> 13:13.003
Hey, Crusader.
How's it goin'?

13:14.553 --> 13:17.550
Rarity's definitely made
the biggest, boldest cart

13:17.593 --> 13:19.033
anypony's ever seen.

13:21.138 --> 13:25.076
Wow. Well, Applejack's built
something so traditional

13:25.138 --> 13:27.052
it's practically an antique.

13:29.212 --> 13:32.443
No matter what I say, there's
no talking Rainbow Dash

13:32.461 --> 13:34.707
out of making the fastest
cart in Equestria.

13:35.384 --> 13:38.289
Doesn't look like any of us
ended up with what we wanted.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.064
But I'm sure our older sisters
know what they're doing, right?

13:44.012 --> 13:45.138
Right.
Right.

13:45.421 --> 13:48.480
And even if our carts aren't
exactly what we had in mind,

13:48.560 --> 13:50.861
it'll still be fun to drive
them to the finish line.

13:51.304 --> 13:53.316
Sure. The race is
the best part!

13:53.550 --> 13:58.504
Yeah. CMCs behind the wheels!
Yeah!

13:58.590 --> 14:00.744
Derby Racers, to
the starting line!

14:00.929 --> 14:03.298
Derby Racers, to
the starting line!

14:03.883 --> 14:05.655
The race is about
to start, Scootaloo.

14:05.815 --> 14:08.867
You better shake a leg if you
want a ride in the winning cart.

14:09.267 --> 14:11.698
You too, Sweetie Belle. There's
only one seat left aboard

14:11.716 --> 14:15.169
this creative masterpiece and
it's just for you. Woo-hoo!

14:15.710 --> 14:17.587
Whoa, ponies! Wait for me!

14:17.790 --> 14:22.430
This traditional cart handles at
the exact perfect pace. Slow!

14:22.867 --> 14:26.240
And I got the passenger seat all
warmed up for you, Apple Bloom!

14:26.670 --> 14:27.753
Passenger seat?

14:38.941 --> 14:41.956
Ugh. They're the only
older ponies driving!

14:42.387 --> 14:45.409
First they built the carts;
now they're gonna drive them?

14:45.692 --> 14:47.347
I know they were
all excited to help,

14:47.409 --> 14:49.846
but I don't think they're
really helping any more.

14:49.993 --> 14:52.689
We better hurry if we want to
be a part of this race at all!

14:55.460 --> 14:58.221
Um, aren't you all
missing somepony?

14:58.406 --> 14:59.310
They'll be along.

14:59.883 --> 15:03.076
And uh, usually the younger
ponies drive the carts.

15:03.796 --> 15:07.280
Darling, do these look
like "usual" carts to you?

15:20.892 --> 15:22.880
Racers, on your marks.

15:23.064 --> 15:24.935
Get set... GO!

15:28.104 --> 15:29.938
AAAAH!

15:30.412 --> 15:33.316
AAAAHHHH!

15:33.729 --> 15:38.000
AAAHHH... can't
we go any faster?

15:38.301 --> 15:41.913
Faster? Don't be
silly; this is perfect!

15:42.929 --> 15:43.643
Ugh.

17:54.092 --> 17:58.326
Oh! My beautiful swan
cart is an ugly duckling!

17:58.966 --> 18:01.840
And my old time cart is
a rootin'-tootin' wreck!

18:04.566 --> 18:08.264
It still counts as a win if I
push my cart across, right?

18:13.101 --> 18:15.440
THEY'RE NOT YOUR CARTS!

18:17.403 --> 18:18.184
HUH?

18:18.449 --> 18:20.233
We were supposed
to design them.

18:20.443 --> 18:23.076
And we were supposed
to drive them.

18:23.255 --> 18:27.113
The Derby was supposed to be
for us, not the three of you!

18:27.323 --> 18:29.716
Now you've ruined
it for everypony!

18:37.132 --> 18:39.095
Yes. Well, I suppose
we might have gotten

18:39.360 --> 18:41.126
a teensy bit carried away.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.741
But I thought you
all wanted our help.

18:43.938 --> 18:47.575
We did. We wanted your
help to build our carts,

18:47.747 --> 18:49.261
but we all ended
up with carts

18:49.320 --> 18:51.083
that are what each
of you wanted.

18:51.427 --> 18:52.443
Umm-hmm.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.273
Well, why didn't
you say anything?

18:55.569 --> 18:59.144
You've all done the race before.
I just figured you knew best.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.184
Plus it's hard to speak
up to older ponies.

19:02.418 --> 19:04.326
Oh, I certainly
understand that,

19:04.732 --> 19:08.203
but you mustn't think older
ponies automatically know best.

19:08.916 --> 19:11.341
And we probably could
have done a better job

19:11.384 --> 19:12.547
of listening to you.

19:13.550 --> 19:16.793
I guess we owe all
three of you an apology.

19:17.384 --> 19:19.273
Maybe not just us.

19:24.787 --> 19:27.052
Um. How do you feel
about a do over?

19:27.298 --> 19:29.710
I think that's a
wonderful idea.

19:29.981 --> 19:33.218
But maybe the older ponies
should sit this one out.

19:37.649 --> 19:41.175
Thanks for helping us fix up our
carts. Pretty creative, right?

19:43.261 --> 19:47.101
I know it's not traditional, but
it sure looks fast, don't it?

19:48.972 --> 19:51.495
You know, darling, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

19:51.587 --> 19:54.584
but that yellow fringe
is rather bold after all!

19:56.670 --> 19:59.384
Thanks, everypony! We couldn't
have done it without you.

20:03.476 --> 20:05.889
Yup, I sure am glad
Ms. Cheerilee agreed

20:05.920 --> 20:07.489
to run the race over again.

20:08.461 --> 20:11.483
Well, it isn't every year I
get to say this twice, but...

20:11.852 --> 20:14.289
Derby Racers, to
the starting line!

20:14.440 --> 20:16.990
Derby Racers, to
the starting line!

20:20.289 --> 20:25.316
Racers, on your
marks, get set, go!

20:25.366 --> 20:28.590
Whoo-hoo!

20:28.726 --> 20:31.243
And it's probably best
keeping all the grownups

20:31.310 --> 20:34.812
on the sidelines, but what
are we supposed to do now?

20:36.313 --> 20:38.750
I think I have an idea.

20:43.181 --> 20:47.138
Ah! Much better. Honestly,
I'm not sure why we wanted

20:47.163 --> 20:49.335
to race those carts
in the first place.

20:49.495 --> 20:54.523
Seriously! This is the most
relaxed I've been all day.

21:17.747 --> 21:21.261
GO SCOOTALOO! GO!
WHOO-WHOO-WHOO-WHOO!

21:22.387 --> 21:28.203
Er, I mean... this is the
life. Right, ponies?

21:29.218 --> 21:30.412
Ah!
