00:21.763 --> 00:25.348
Whatever they decide, Apple
Bloom, we'll be here for you.

00:25.555 --> 00:26.204
Totally.

00:26.505 --> 00:28.630
Even though it could
change everything for you!

00:28.880 --> 00:30.560
<i>Forever! And ever!</i>

00:48.850 --> 00:49.867
So.

00:50.403 --> 00:53.857
We here have decided...

00:56.224 --> 00:58.651
That you're old enough
to stay home alone

00:58.665 --> 01:01.381
and take care of the chores
yourself for the afternoon.

01:06.284 --> 01:07.763
I accept your decision.

01:13.847 --> 01:17.720
I'm staying home alone!
Whoo hoo!

02:13.904 --> 02:15.155
Staying home alone.

02:15.562 --> 02:18.185
By myself! On my own!

02:24.037 --> 02:25.644
I can't believe I'm
really doing it!

02:25.943 --> 02:28.716
Now, hey there, filly.
I know you're excited.

02:28.878 --> 02:31.322
But bein' the only pony here to
take care of the day's chores

02:31.336 --> 02:32.901
is a big responsibility.

02:33.207 --> 02:34.107
I know it!

02:34.355 --> 02:36.483
And it means everything
to me that ya'll think

02:36.491 --> 02:38.158
I'm grown up enough
to handle it.

02:38.396 --> 02:39.461
I won't let you down!

02:40.331 --> 02:43.488
Well, if'n I'm gonna make
my train, I best to be off.

02:43.734 --> 02:46.759
When Great-Aunt Pine Apple
says a pony's gots to arrive

02:46.762 --> 02:49.180
by a certain time, you
better be there!

02:49.818 --> 02:52.485
You be sure and take
care now, Apple Bloom.

02:54.343 --> 02:55.923
Y'all take care as well.

02:56.312 --> 02:59.283
I don't know which of your
delivery routes is tougher.

02:59.502 --> 03:02.647
<i>You're each headed to a</i>
<i>mighty hard-to-reach town.</i>

03:03.562 --> 03:04.183
Eeyup.

03:04.593 --> 03:05.520
We know, Granny.

03:05.851 --> 03:07.728
That's the only reason I
agreed to let Apple Bloom

03:07.734 --> 03:08.778
<i>stay behind alone.</i>

03:09.289 --> 03:09.986
It is?

03:10.571 --> 03:12.735
Oh, I didn't mean it
like that, Sugar Cube.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.636
It's just, I take my job as
your big sister real serious.

03:17.059 --> 03:19.840
Which is why I spent
all night making this.

03:21.069 --> 03:21.966
What is it?

03:22.193 --> 03:24.241
Just a little list
of helpful reminders.

03:24.780 --> 03:26.491
"There's some soup for
you in the fridgerator."

03:26.515 --> 03:28.214
"Be sure not to heat
it up too much."

03:28.296 --> 03:30.318
"If its hot, blow on
it to cool it off."

03:30.450 --> 03:31.445
"And take little sips;"

03:31.678 --> 03:33.853
"if you gulp, you
could get hiccups."

03:34.495 --> 03:35.625
You don't have to
worry about me.

03:35.838 --> 03:37.890
I can take of myself
and the chores.

03:38.017 --> 03:39.198
I'm ready for this!

03:39.594 --> 03:41.600
I guess you are.

03:42.068 --> 03:43.832
I'm just not so sure I am.

03:44.097 --> 03:47.557
But you trust me and believe I'm
grown up enough to handle this,

03:47.662 --> 03:48.362
right?

03:51.363 --> 03:52.747
Right.

03:53.100 --> 03:53.822
OK, then.

03:54.265 --> 03:55.194
Good luck, little sis.

03:55.685 --> 03:57.022
OK great!
see you soon. Bye!

04:03.851 --> 04:09.114
<i>Goodbye! So long!</i>
<i>See ya! Bye now!</i>

04:16.567 --> 04:17.430
Woo-hoo!

04:17.609 --> 04:18.501
I'm alone!

04:18.649 --> 04:19.490
At home!

04:19.551 --> 04:20.954
I'm home alone!

04:21.104 --> 04:23.338
This is going to be so AWESOME!

04:37.272 --> 04:38.210
Heh heh.

04:39.024 --> 04:40.089
<i>Sorry, Big Mac.</i>

04:40.409 --> 04:42.478
I was just frettin' a
bit about Apple Bloom.

04:42.823 --> 04:44.558
You think she's gonna
be OK on her own?

04:44.936 --> 04:45.506
Eeyup.

04:46.835 --> 04:48.643
I just keep on thinking
of things I forgot

04:48.657 --> 04:49.761
to put on her list.

04:50.169 --> 04:52.809
Like, I didn't write down that
if she wants to get a spoon

04:52.813 --> 04:55.736
out of the drawer, she needs
to open the drawer first.

04:57.201 --> 04:59.036
I know I'm probably
just being silly.

04:59.424 --> 04:59.943
Eeyup.

05:00.419 --> 05:02.698
But I know I'd feel a heap
better if I could just

05:02.700 --> 05:04.641
check on Apple Bloom
one last time.

05:08.454 --> 05:10.132
You go on ahead and
make your delivery.

05:10.407 --> 05:13.059
I'm just gonna take quick
peek and then I'll make mine.

05:19.375 --> 05:21.281
<i>OK, number 172.</i>

05:21.660 --> 05:23.951
"Make sure to pump the bellows
to keep the stove warm."

05:28.388 --> 05:28.788
Check!

05:29.205 --> 05:31.512
"Make sure the Hats and Bows
closet is fully stocked."

05:33.537 --> 05:34.175
Check!

05:35.428 --> 05:37.752
That's everything
on Applejack's list.

05:38.212 --> 05:41.639
And now that my chores are done,
since there's no one else here,

05:41.863 --> 05:43.500
I get to make all the decisions!

05:43.808 --> 05:45.929
If I want to listen
to music, I can!

05:46.265 --> 05:48.312
If I want to read a book, I can!

05:48.546 --> 05:51.149
If I wanna just stand here in
the kitchen talking to myself,

05:51.496 --> 05:52.253
I can!

05:52.628 --> 05:53.408
Gah!
Apple Bloom!

05:53.457 --> 05:54.667
Whoa!

05:58.236 --> 06:00.690
Applejack?

06:01.443 --> 06:02.952
I came back to check on you.

06:03.184 --> 06:04.526
And I am so glad I did!

06:07.412 --> 06:09.399
I never thought about how
dangerous things are

06:09.402 --> 06:10.124
around here.

06:11.098 --> 06:13.379
Thanks. But I'm
really gonna be OK.

06:13.925 --> 06:14.868
You are now.

06:15.205 --> 06:17.024
Because I'm here,
and I'm staying!

06:17.504 --> 06:19.541
No way am I leaving
my little baby sister

06:19.553 --> 06:21.149
home alone all by herself!

06:21.631 --> 06:22.737
I'm not a baby!

06:22.856 --> 06:24.360
I can take care of myself.

06:24.493 --> 06:26.663
And what about those pies
you're supposed to deliver?

06:27.127 --> 06:30.880
Pies? Ha. Family's way
more important than pies.

06:31.412 --> 06:32.901
But I'm fine.

06:33.381 --> 06:37.479
And actually, this was
kind of your fault.

06:37.970 --> 06:38.700
I know.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.000
I should never have
left you alone.

06:42.889 --> 06:44.519
But I don't need you
looking after me.

06:44.653 --> 06:47.086
I'm perfectly capable
of staying home alone.

06:47.322 --> 06:47.990
Really!

06:50.520 --> 06:51.342
Just look!

06:51.736 --> 06:53.539
"There's some soup for you
in the fridgerator."

06:54.320 --> 06:55.190
What was that?

06:55.732 --> 06:56.766
Watch me.

07:00.411 --> 07:01.112
Whoa!

07:03.201 --> 07:03.859
Oh, no!

07:04.647 --> 07:05.955
This is worse than I thought!

07:06.193 --> 07:07.787
Well, don't worry Apple Bloom.

07:07.840 --> 07:11.399
I'm here now and I'm not leaving
you home alone ever again.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.985
I'm sticking right
by your side, always!

07:23.160 --> 07:23.853
Apple Bloom?

07:24.766 --> 07:25.726
Apple Bloom!

07:26.840 --> 07:28.848
Applejack's just
over reactin' a bit.

07:29.123 --> 07:30.571
I'm sure she'll snap out of it.

07:30.733 --> 07:31.687
Whoa!

07:32.357 --> 07:33.000
You need something?

07:33.104 --> 07:33.941
I'm right here!

07:34.226 --> 07:37.299
I know you mean well, but I
don't need you watching over me.

07:37.529 --> 07:39.605
I can take care
of things myself.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.132
Look!

07:46.770 --> 07:47.309
Huh?

07:48.870 --> 07:51.783
Hey! Who put pillows
on this rake?

07:52.066 --> 07:53.836
Oh, I don't know.

07:54.126 --> 07:56.202
Maybe someone who really
loves her little sister

07:56.212 --> 07:57.828
and doesn't want her
to get an owie?

08:03.242 --> 08:05.890
Hey, Applejack, watch me buck
these apples on my own

08:05.902 --> 08:08.058
without anything bad
happening to me.

08:13.777 --> 08:14.405
Huh?

08:43.676 --> 08:45.170
Agh! For the love of...!

08:46.142 --> 08:48.491
You've gone and
baby-proofed everything!

08:48.999 --> 08:50.134
Yup!

08:50.480 --> 08:52.200
Your big sister
let you down once.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.721
But I promise it won't
ever happen again!

08:55.159 --> 08:57.178
But really, I'm fine.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.809
I can take care of myself.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.182
I don't need you
watching over me.

09:01.293 --> 09:03.192
Aw, that's sweet.

09:03.512 --> 09:05.348
I appreciate you trying
to make me feel better.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.480
But don't worry; I'll
ALWAYS be here for you!

09:08.880 --> 09:09.921
Always!

09:15.299 --> 09:18.060
And that's the reason I asked
y'all to come over quick.

09:18.152 --> 09:19.793
<i>Hey, Apple Bloom,</i>
<i>you need anything?</i>

09:19.972 --> 09:21.336
A snack? A hoof massage?

09:21.613 --> 09:23.170
Maybe a snack while
havin' a hoof massage?

09:23.560 --> 09:24.948
Why that sounds delightful!

09:25.328 --> 09:26.768
No thank you!

09:27.188 --> 09:30.167
OK, well, you can count
on me being close by

09:30.171 --> 09:31.240
if you need anything.

09:31.906 --> 09:32.462
Whew!

09:32.940 --> 09:34.027
You see what I mean?

09:34.193 --> 09:37.145
If this keeps up, I'm never
going to be able to do anything

09:37.153 --> 09:39.157
without Applejack
hoverin' over me!

09:39.613 --> 09:40.632
Mm hm.

09:40.946 --> 09:42.144
So what can we do?

09:42.739 --> 09:44.626
Hmmm... Uh...

09:51.496 --> 09:52.298
Hang on a sec!

09:52.938 --> 09:53.760
I got it!

09:54.052 --> 09:54.667
What?

09:55.092 --> 09:55.947
The pies!

09:56.253 --> 09:57.771
I'll sneak out
and deliver them!

09:58.056 --> 09:59.141
Granny said they were going

09:59.153 --> 10:01.178
to some incredibly
hard-to-reach town.

10:01.449 --> 10:03.996
If I can do it alone,
that'll show Applejack

10:04.003 --> 10:06.021
I don't need somepony
watchin' over me!

10:06.398 --> 10:09.393
Just one problem: your
sister's gonna come back

10:09.402 --> 10:10.729
and check on you any minute!

10:10.965 --> 10:13.336
Which means you
need an escape plan!

10:14.117 --> 10:16.339
Oooh! And I got
an idea for one.

10:27.574 --> 10:29.703
See? It'll look just like
you're sleeping in bed.

10:29.990 --> 10:31.467
Sweetie and I can take turns.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.245
That way, when one of us gets
tired, the other can take over.

10:34.517 --> 10:35.354
Brilliant, huh?

10:36.107 --> 10:36.864
You know what?

10:37.375 --> 10:38.230
It is!

10:38.462 --> 10:40.321
I got a feelin' this
just might work!

10:41.939 --> 10:44.372
<i>♪ We're gonna make my</i>
<i>sister see ♪</i>

10:44.563 --> 10:47.219
<i>♪ I don't need her</i>
<i>watchin' over me! ♪</i>

10:47.227 --> 10:47.824
Stop!

10:49.391 --> 10:51.332
No time for a song!
Applejack's coming!

10:51.623 --> 10:54.294
If you're going to go, we've
got to get you out of here now!

10:54.792 --> 10:57.295
<i>Cutie Mark Crusaders!</i>
<i>Let's do it!</i>

11:01.147 --> 11:01.937
Whoa!

11:17.012 --> 11:18.840
<i>Everything all right</i>
<i>in there, Sugar Cube?</i>

11:19.389 --> 11:20.772
Quick! Get in while I hide!

11:26.376 --> 11:27.250
Sweetie, No!

11:27.393 --> 11:28.872
You gotta sleep
like Apple Bloom!

11:29.229 --> 11:30.374
How does she sleep?

11:30.561 --> 11:33.410
Like she does
everything. With sass!

11:36.749 --> 11:37.143
Huh.

11:37.482 --> 11:39.008
I guess you must've
been so tuckered out

11:39.010 --> 11:40.645
you sent your friends
home and went to bed.

11:41.190 --> 11:43.332
Then again, you are
a delicate flower.

11:44.421 --> 11:45.814
Sleep tight, Apple Bloom.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.181
I'll check on you
again in a bit.

11:52.095 --> 11:53.375
Just checking in on you again.

11:59.084 --> 11:59.994
Need anything now?

12:01.229 --> 12:01.814
How about now?

12:03.463 --> 12:04.208
Need another blanket?

12:05.369 --> 12:06.292
Did I hear a cough?

12:07.340 --> 12:08.117
Want a glass of water?

12:23.765 --> 12:25.414
Just checkin' in on you again.

12:27.270 --> 12:30.634
Look at you, dozin'
so peaceful-like.

12:31.285 --> 12:33.851
Here I am, checkin' up on ya
every five seconds.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.697
And you're totally fine.

12:36.087 --> 12:39.034
Maybe you don't need me
frettin' over you all the time.

12:39.822 --> 12:42.542
Wow! Apple Bloom will be
so glad to hear that!

12:42.657 --> 12:43.100
Huh?

12:44.454 --> 12:45.258
Scootaloo?

12:45.432 --> 12:47.201
Uh, no.

12:48.667 --> 12:49.459
Sweetie Belle?

12:49.674 --> 12:51.270
But where's Apple Bloom?

12:51.793 --> 12:52.727
She's not here!

12:53.939 --> 12:55.182
<i>She could be anywhere!</i>

12:56.165 --> 12:59.240
<i>She could be lost, cold,</i>
<i>hungry, itchy, stuffed up,</i>

12:59.256 --> 13:00.591
<i>needin' to go to the bathroom!</i>

13:00.930 --> 13:03.032
Don't worry. We know
exactly where she is.

13:03.272 --> 13:05.324
Yeah. She's making
your pie delivery.

13:06.569 --> 13:07.912
What? No!

13:08.202 --> 13:10.540
Didn't she hear how difficult
and dangerous it was?

13:12.329 --> 13:15.533
I may never see my
little sister again!

13:19.877 --> 13:22.331
OK, Rarity's on her way here
to look after you two.

13:23.397 --> 13:26.558
Now tell me, did Apple Bloom at
least bring flame-proof boots?

13:27.994 --> 13:29.073
A lion tamer's chair?

13:30.493 --> 13:31.736
A snake-charming flute?

13:33.073 --> 13:34.021
A hunk of ricotta?

13:39.728 --> 13:40.224
OK.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.640
Maybe there's still time to
catch her before she gets there.

13:43.030 --> 13:43.843
<i>When did she leave?</i>

13:44.612 --> 13:45.840
It must have been hours ago.

13:47.151 --> 13:47.976
Oh no!

14:18.456 --> 14:21.096
I can't see a darn
thing in this swamp.

14:21.254 --> 14:21.607
Ah!

14:28.524 --> 14:30.078
Well, now at least I can see.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.889
I'd stay where you are.

14:59.387 --> 15:01.555
This is the only safe
spot around here.

15:04.076 --> 15:06.017
It don't look
so safe to me.

15:06.583 --> 15:09.457
Oh, we just mean
from the flames.

15:09.851 --> 15:12.060
Yeah, not from us.

15:12.698 --> 15:13.916
What was that?

15:15.157 --> 15:17.120
Can you guys sssspeak up?

15:17.715 --> 15:22.848
I was about to tell our guest
how we haven't eaten in days.

15:23.360 --> 15:26.304
My sisters and I can never
agree on what to eat!

15:27.726 --> 15:30.083
Except pie.

15:34.321 --> 15:38.109
Well, unfortunately, I got to
get these pies to a town

15:38.113 --> 15:40.107
<i>on the other side of</i>
<i>the swamp. So uh...</i>

15:40.115 --> 15:43.135
Oh, you don't have
to worry about that.

15:43.324 --> 15:46.942
Yeah, you don't have to
worry about anything anymore.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.617
Because we're gonna
have our apple pie

15:49.908 --> 15:52.651
with a sssside
of filly filet!

15:53.504 --> 15:54.858
You don't say.

16:03.775 --> 16:05.713
Now sisters, on three.

16:06.253 --> 16:06.870
One.

16:08.881 --> 16:09.992
Two!

16:12.819 --> 16:13.256
Three!

16:26.329 --> 16:27.123
No!

16:29.400 --> 16:31.662
Where do you think you're going?

16:45.976 --> 16:46.805
Oomph!

17:19.806 --> 17:21.387
Where are the pies?

17:22.085 --> 17:23.404
They're not back here.

17:23.715 --> 17:25.098
This is your fault!

17:25.295 --> 17:27.512
You think you've always
got to be in charge.

17:28.696 --> 17:29.923
You're lucky, you know.

17:30.163 --> 17:32.241
You've got no idea what it's
like to have a sister

17:32.255 --> 17:34.267
<i>constantly looking</i>
<i>over your shoulder.</i>

17:34.825 --> 17:36.370
Uh, actually...

17:36.567 --> 17:39.159
Let's try listening
to me for a change.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.880
And I say: if
there are no pies,

17:42.103 --> 17:45.326
let's settle for
the filly filet.

17:46.950 --> 17:49.678
Any last words?

17:51.071 --> 17:52.840
I really wish my
sister were here!

17:53.972 --> 17:56.560
<i>Hang on, Apple Bloom!</i>
<i>I'm a'comin'!</i>

18:00.885 --> 18:01.689
<i>Get her!</i>

18:01.998 --> 18:04.874
Hey, I thought I
was in charge now!

18:40.911 --> 18:41.783
Howdy!

19:07.988 --> 19:09.910
Mmmm. Ricotta!

19:13.832 --> 19:14.579
Let's go!

19:24.292 --> 19:25.170
Are you OK?

19:26.659 --> 19:27.529
Thanks to you.

19:29.512 --> 19:31.879
I told ya ya need your big
sister looking after you!

19:32.386 --> 19:34.474
I'm just glad this
wasn't a whole lot worse.

19:34.870 --> 19:37.701
I mean, sure, we lost the
cart and all the pies,

19:37.947 --> 19:38.829
but at least you're--

19:43.182 --> 19:45.483
The cart! And all the pies!

19:45.676 --> 19:48.544
You actually got them all
the up way here, in the dark,

19:49.010 --> 19:51.951
through the Flame Geyser
Swamp, past that monster?

19:54.167 --> 19:55.192
By yourself?

19:55.791 --> 19:57.492
Well... yeah.

19:58.950 --> 20:02.378
Wow. That's mighty
impressive.

20:02.997 --> 20:05.000
Anypony who can do
that on her own, well,

20:05.769 --> 20:08.267
she don't need somepony
like me babying her.

20:19.485 --> 20:22.486
Mmmmm!
Andouille!

20:22.610 --> 20:26.515
Dis pie's even tastier den ma
mama's swamp-water casserole!

20:29.761 --> 20:32.680
Aw, now, Mama,
don't be like dat!

20:38.115 --> 20:40.993
Just remember, you fellas
wouldn't be enjoyin' these pies

20:41.002 --> 20:42.439
if it weren't for my sister.

20:43.539 --> 20:44.792
And MY sister!

20:45.313 --> 20:46.759
But this don't change the fact

20:46.764 --> 20:48.440
that trying to make this
delivery on your own

20:48.450 --> 20:50.255
was a plumb crazy
thing to do.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.066
I know.

20:53.319 --> 20:56.321
I bet Granny Smith grounds you
for a month for sneakin' out!

20:56.690 --> 20:59.637
And if Big Mac, Granny Smith
and I ever have to be away

20:59.642 --> 21:00.790
for the day again...

21:02.308 --> 21:04.640
I would totally trust
you to stay home

21:04.651 --> 21:06.481
and take care of
things on your own.

21:07.787 --> 21:11.088
I guess I did get a little
carried away watchin' over ya,

21:11.486 --> 21:13.198
and if ya hadn't snuck
out like you did,

21:13.668 --> 21:15.256
maybe I wouldn't have
figured that out.

21:15.771 --> 21:18.686
Yes! Now that is the kind
of looking out for me

21:18.690 --> 21:21.071
I can definitely appreciate!

21:21.420 --> 21:22.749
So we're good?

21:23.278 --> 21:25.902
Little sister,
we're always good.
