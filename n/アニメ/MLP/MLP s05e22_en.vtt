WEBVTT

00:02.188 --> 00:04.524
Didn't we just shelve
all the books

00:04.548 --> 00:06.724
in the library a few
months ago?

00:07.284 --> 00:09.568
Yes, but that was
because we needed to;

00:09.760 --> 00:11.632
this is just
because I want to:

00:11.928 --> 00:13.868
I call it my
booksortcation.

00:13.972 --> 00:16.480
Three uninterrupted days
of re-organizing books!

00:16.536 --> 00:18.312
Can you think of
anything more relaxing?

00:18.720 --> 00:22.212
Well, claw massages, back
rubs, bubble baths...

00:24.200 --> 00:26.412
You weren't really looking
for an answer, were you.

00:26.708 --> 00:29.272
I've even devised a better
system for organizing them.

00:29.592 --> 00:31.716
It decreases the amount of
time it takes to find the book

00:31.736 --> 00:33.912
you're looking for by
nearly 3/4 of a second.

00:34.544 --> 00:36.364
Whoa! That much?

00:37.684 --> 00:38.604
Look at them all.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.064
Why there must be at least
20,000 books to organize.

00:42.504 --> 00:43.544
Whoooo!

00:44.280 --> 00:46.312
Best long weekend ever!

00:49.052 --> 00:51.776
I'm sure we can make some
time for a claw massage

00:51.792 --> 00:53.024
and a back rub, too.

00:53.564 --> 00:56.156
Yes! Best long weekend ever!

01:03.631 --> 01:05.564
Regular subtitles by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

01:44.516 --> 01:49.520
Whoa, that strange yellow
orb in the sky! What is that?

01:49.840 --> 01:50.964
All right, all right.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.492
So it's been a little while
since we've seen the sun.

01:53.796 --> 01:54.920
A little while?

01:55.208 --> 01:57.604
We've been in that library
for 3 straight days.

01:57.728 --> 02:00.688
Yes! But they were three
very productive days!

02:00.928 --> 02:04.020
Even if you did take that
two-hour claw massage break.

02:04.568 --> 02:08.016
Hey! You promise a claw massage?
I'm getting a claw massage.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.964
It's not like we
missed anything.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.764
Hello, Twilight.

02:18.908 --> 02:20.192
Hi, Spike.

02:20.512 --> 02:21.900
Hi, Rainbow Dash.

02:21.992 --> 02:23.804
Good to see you, Discord.

02:24.012 --> 02:26.108
Did you rehearse
before you found us?

02:26.296 --> 02:28.840
What makes you
think we practiced?

02:29.768 --> 02:32.024
Come on, Rainbow Dash.
What's going on here?

02:35.732 --> 02:39.468
Sorry, me and Discord are
just messin' around. Ha ha.

02:40.028 --> 02:41.016
Like we do.

02:41.208 --> 02:42.368
Since when?

02:42.536 --> 02:45.852
Oh, Twilight, we've simply
had a momentous time together

02:45.888 --> 02:48.100
these past three days.

02:48.284 --> 02:53.324
You could say it was
hisss-sterical! Ha ha ha.

02:53.364 --> 02:56.924
Ha ha ha! Sneaky Snake.

02:56.976 --> 03:03.352
Hoo hoo hoo! Just
snaking around.

03:03.376 --> 03:04.764
Good one, Discord!

03:06.268 --> 03:07.304
It is?

03:07.536 --> 03:10.880
Kind of an inside joke
from this weekend.

03:11.008 --> 03:13.260
You wouldn't really get
it unless you were there.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.180
Oh. OK.

03:15.668 --> 03:18.364
Cool. Well, uh, catch
you later, Twilight.

03:20.212 --> 03:22.692
Catch you later, Twilight.

03:29.184 --> 03:30.296
That was strange, right?

03:30.532 --> 03:33.844
Since when have Rainbow Dash
and Discord had "inside jokes"?

03:34.200 --> 03:37.332
Since sometime in the
last three days, I guess.

03:38.104 --> 03:41.436
Hey! Nopony made you join
me on my booksortcation.

03:41.652 --> 03:43.384
I'm joking. I'm joking.

03:45.740 --> 03:46.440
Rarity?

03:47.016 --> 03:51.260
Twilight! You've returned from
your book-sorting sabbatical.

03:51.672 --> 03:54.356
All that organizing has done
wonders for your complexion.

03:54.392 --> 03:56.940
Thanks. It was
very relaxing.

03:58.244 --> 03:59.548
And we were able
to clear a shelf

03:59.592 --> 04:01.624
for those old-fashioned
books you wanted to donate.

04:01.836 --> 04:05.048
They're not old, darling;
they're vintage.

04:05.308 --> 04:08.384
And they're over there. I've
even included my favorites

04:08.404 --> 04:12.448
by former Canterlot Designer
to the stars, Rococo Froufrou.

04:12.728 --> 04:14.468
Ooh, I love her.

04:15.016 --> 04:15.620
Him.

04:15.860 --> 04:17.920
Uh, ha. Both.

04:18.332 --> 04:19.392
Twilight!

04:20.104 --> 04:25.408
This makes twice I'm seeing you
in one day. Aren't I lucky?

04:25.812 --> 04:26.840
Weren't you just with--

04:26.864 --> 04:30.560
Hi, Twilight! Hi, Spike!
How was your booksortcation?

04:30.724 --> 04:31.428
It was good.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.700
Orange you glad
you did it?

04:37.416 --> 04:42.648
"Orange" you glad! Fluttershy,
you're a card!

04:42.784 --> 04:45.248
Oh please, you'll make me blush.

04:45.400 --> 04:50.344
You do seem to be turning
a shade of orange!

04:59.780 --> 05:03.472
Oh, sorry, darling. You see, we
were at Sweet Apple Acres...

05:03.496 --> 05:06.332
And oh, how to explain...

05:06.560 --> 05:09.196
Well, let me try and paint
her a picture, dearest.

05:09.420 --> 05:10.416
"Dearest?"

05:11.384 --> 05:14.964
You see, we were all
at Sweet Apple Acres

05:15.236 --> 05:18.840
and I ended up turning
the trees into the most--

05:18.944 --> 05:21.112
Oh, who am I kidding?

05:21.140 --> 05:26.540
I simply can't do it justice.
You really had to be there.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.624
We would have invited
you to come along too,

05:28.660 --> 05:30.764
but we didn't want to
interrupt your organizing.

05:30.868 --> 05:32.588
We know how important
it is to you.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.704
And I'm sure it was
much more important

05:35.904 --> 05:39.016
than the fun that we had.

05:40.348 --> 05:41.564
I appreciate that.

05:41.844 --> 05:44.196
Speaking of books, I should
get these on the shelves.

05:52.740 --> 05:55.712
Hmm, Rainbow Dash
bonding with Discord;

05:55.820 --> 05:58.540
Rarity finding something
he did genuinely funny?

05:58.828 --> 06:00.656
Must have been some weekend.

06:01.472 --> 06:04.004
Somepony sorry she missed it?

06:04.268 --> 06:05.052
Of course not.

06:10.824 --> 06:12.672
What's got you two
in hysterics?

06:14.476 --> 06:19.600
Oh, we were just reminiscing
about the best weekend ever!

06:20.300 --> 06:21.976
He's everywhere
today, isn't he?

06:22.288 --> 06:23.732
Oh, now where was I?

06:23.792 --> 06:28.308
Ah, yes, we'd just finished our
soup and then Applejack said,

06:29.160 --> 06:33.420
"Peanut butter hoof? Yuck!
Not even with jelly."

06:37.456 --> 06:38.432
I don't get it.

06:39.148 --> 06:42.704
It was hilarious. I wish we'd
taken a picture for you.

06:42.988 --> 06:44.720
Oh, well
this should do.

06:52.652 --> 06:54.464
I guess that's funny?

06:55.216 --> 07:00.732
Well, seems this has become
quite the sticky situation.

07:00.792 --> 07:04.356
HA! Sticky situation!

07:05.268 --> 07:06.700
Aw shucks, Twilight,

07:06.916 --> 07:08.864
we haven't even asked
how your weekend went.

07:09.172 --> 07:09.932
It was fine.

07:10.136 --> 07:12.520
And yet you look so glum.

07:12.896 --> 07:16.540
Does somepony need
a huggy-wuggy?

07:16.740 --> 07:20.448
Whoooo.

07:20.568 --> 07:22.732
I am not glum. I'm glad.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.468
I'm glad you all had such
a good time together.

07:25.660 --> 07:28.032
Having inside jokes can
really create a lasting bond

07:28.052 --> 07:29.080
between friends.

07:29.324 --> 07:32.048
I'm just sorry that all
this bonding happened

07:32.068 --> 07:34.748
while you were holed
up in your castle.

07:35.776 --> 07:37.872
Oh, don't you worry
'bout Twilight.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.980
Bet you were in hog heaven
organizin' all them books.

07:41.580 --> 07:42.324
Again.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.880
I'm sure I had just as much
fun as the rest of you.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.388
I can't believe I missed
out on all that bonding.

07:51.308 --> 07:53.396
I knew it! You are jealous!

07:53.476 --> 07:57.460
Spike, I'm the Princess of
Friendship. I don't get jealous.

07:57.712 --> 08:00.112
I'm sorry I missed out because
sharing that experience

08:00.132 --> 08:02.460
would have helped me with my
Princess of Friendship duties.

08:04.244 --> 08:04.980
Come again?

08:05.220 --> 08:07.644
If our friends could enjoy
three full days with Discord

08:07.664 --> 08:09.596
that much, it must have
something to do with

08:09.616 --> 08:11.448
the specific things
they did together.

08:11.788 --> 08:13.364
If we could find out
what those things were,

08:13.388 --> 08:16.068
it could be a real breakthrough
in the science of friendship.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.448
I guess so.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.800
I know so! You thought our
booksortcation was fun?

08:23.004 --> 08:25.364
This is going to be
even better!

08:29.784 --> 08:30.868
Thank you for coming.

08:31.048 --> 08:33.404
I wouldn't have asked you
here if it wasn't important.

08:33.560 --> 08:35.300
I love important!

08:35.536 --> 08:39.188
I want to know how these "funny"
moments you shared came to pass.

08:39.340 --> 08:41.672
I can use this data to
help advance friendships

08:41.692 --> 08:42.888
all over Equestria.

08:43.300 --> 08:44.704
Well, I like the sound of that.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.640
Perfect. Let's start
with, "The Snake."

08:55.508 --> 08:59.516
I don't know if I can get
it out! It's too funny!

08:59.700 --> 09:02.872
Oh, but we must. It's
for the greater good.

09:03.068 --> 09:06.900
It started when we were helping
Granny Smith with her garden.

09:07.144 --> 09:10.264
Uh, I reckon you mean
my sister, Apple Bloom.

09:10.688 --> 09:13.280
Oh. All you Apples
look the same.

09:13.576 --> 09:16.776
And then Rainbow
Dash saw a snake.

09:17.020 --> 09:19.300
I think it was a garden hose.

09:19.412 --> 09:22.032
It was a "Hose
Snake." Super Deadly.

09:22.308 --> 09:24.556
I recall it being a large stick

09:24.660 --> 09:27.224
that looked like a hose
that in turn did in fact

09:27.248 --> 09:28.284
resemble a snake.

09:28.472 --> 09:30.476
Point is WE galloped away!

09:30.780 --> 09:32.580
And it chased after us!

09:32.632 --> 09:35.248
The hose? A snake? A stick?

09:35.304 --> 09:35.804
A snake!

09:35.832 --> 09:36.524
A hose!

09:36.548 --> 09:37.124
A stick!

09:37.572 --> 09:42.076
We literally trotted for our
lives. Isn't that hilarious?

09:42.444 --> 09:44.180
I guess you had to be there.

09:44.972 --> 09:46.532
I DO need to be there.

09:46.740 --> 09:47.656
But you weren't.

09:47.976 --> 09:51.356
And it's already happened.
Oooh. Are you suggesting--

09:51.540 --> 09:52.920
Time Travel?

09:53.156 --> 09:57.944
Absolutely not! Time travel is
not something to be messed with.

09:58.092 --> 09:59.948
We simply need to
recreate everything

09:59.964 --> 10:01.404
that led to these jokes.

10:01.956 --> 10:04.732
Oh! What a brilliant idea!

10:04.964 --> 10:07.420
Shall we begin with the
lunch date that kicked off

10:07.456 --> 10:10.644
the glorious weekend
you missed out on?

10:13.164 --> 10:14.580
Are you sure it was this table?

10:14.881 --> 10:16.748
Uh, does it really matter?

10:17.020 --> 10:19.352
When it comes to science,
everything matters.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.916
One change to the equation
could ruin the experiment.

10:22.328 --> 10:26.032
Ohhhhh. It was this table here.

10:31.716 --> 10:33.856
All right, so you
sat down at the table

10:33.876 --> 10:34.744
and then what happened?

10:34.856 --> 10:36.696
Oh, well first, I
expressed my displeasure

10:36.712 --> 10:38.184
with the design
of the menu and--

10:38.224 --> 10:41.332
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt, but
I've just noticed something.

10:41.436 --> 10:42.008
Yes?

10:42.340 --> 10:44.916
The tablecloth. It
isn't the same color

10:44.936 --> 10:47.720
as the one the restaurant
used on the day in question.

10:49.148 --> 10:49.996
Really?

10:50.260 --> 10:53.228
He's right. The
tablecloth was red.

10:53.532 --> 10:56.020
I remember because it clashed
with the font on the menus.

10:56.316 --> 10:57.884
I don't suppose that
means we're gonna need

10:57.900 --> 10:59.496
to get a new
tablecloth, does it?

10:59.816 --> 11:02.036
Oh, most definitely.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.130
Wow!

11:05.608 --> 11:09.304
One change to the equation
could ruin the experiment.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.856
Twilight said so herself.

11:13.132 --> 11:18.060
Anything stand out as being
different? Anything at all?

11:18.332 --> 11:20.692
Um, I've noticed a
couple of things.

11:20.836 --> 11:21.756
Me, too!

11:21.864 --> 11:23.388
Excellent.

11:28.076 --> 11:29.904
A little to the left...

11:30.168 --> 11:31.480
no, my left...

11:31.932 --> 11:33.124
a little bit more...

11:33.168 --> 11:35.168
oh no, no, no, a
little more right.

11:35.592 --> 11:38.724
The cloud over our table looked
like an ice cream sundae.

11:43.076 --> 11:44.184
Perfect.

11:50.252 --> 11:53.048
No. No. No. No. No. This is
barely room temperature.

11:53.236 --> 11:56.000
Garcon! Garcon, over here.

12:05.088 --> 12:06.340
No? Nothing?

12:07.688 --> 12:09.920
Are you sure there's not
something you've missed?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.108
Some other detail about
your lunch together

12:12.120 --> 12:12.972
that you're forgetting?

12:13.748 --> 12:15.048
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you,

12:15.068 --> 12:17.620
but I feel we've been pretty
exhaustive in our attempts

12:17.648 --> 12:21.320
to recreate every single detail
of our previous encounter.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.052
Yeah, Twilight. If you
don't get it by now,

12:27.192 --> 12:29.040
I don't think you're
ever gonna get it.

12:29.284 --> 12:31.648
But it is really important
that I figure this out.

12:31.824 --> 12:33.408
It's for the good
of all Equestria.

12:33.812 --> 12:35.376
Well, perhaps we should
have another look

12:35.392 --> 12:37.104
at the data we've collected.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.204
Of course!

12:40.476 --> 12:43.856
There is one last variable
that we haven't accounted for.

12:44.144 --> 12:44.776
What?

12:45.792 --> 12:47.060
You!

12:48.336 --> 12:48.968
Me?

12:49.328 --> 12:51.376
You weren't there observing us.

12:51.672 --> 12:54.776
No matter how hard we try,
we can't possibly recreate

12:54.796 --> 12:57.652
our weekend of fun
exactly as it happened

12:57.972 --> 13:01.220
because you'll always be
watching and you weren't there.

13:02.776 --> 13:03.872
He makes a good point.

13:04.440 --> 13:08.340
It has only served to prove that
moments of levity and bonding

13:08.360 --> 13:12.300
between friends simply
cannot be recreated

13:12.332 --> 13:15.988
so that others might
share in the experience.

13:16.228 --> 13:17.888
He makes another good point.

13:18.104 --> 13:19.528
Oh, don't worry, darling;

13:19.656 --> 13:21.960
I'm sure there'll be plenty of
other chances for you to share

13:21.992 --> 13:24.000
in the kind of frivolity
we had with Discord

13:24.072 --> 13:25.224
while you were away.

13:25.652 --> 13:30.344
Yeah. And I'll bet they'll
be just as...hissssterical.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.214
Absolutely.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.248
I'm not buying it.
Not for a second.

13:42.448 --> 13:44.916
There is definitely something
else going on here, Spike.

13:45.732 --> 13:47.716
Or maybe there isn't
and you should just drop

13:47.736 --> 13:49.848
this whole thing and admit
that you're a little jealous?

13:50.060 --> 13:51.956
Even if I'm not able to
laugh at what happened,

13:52.160 --> 13:54.496
I should be able to figure
out why they find it funny.

13:54.712 --> 13:57.008
Why they think they had
this amazing and hilarious

13:57.024 --> 13:57.804
time together.

13:57.944 --> 14:00.952
But I can't figure it out.
It doesn't make sense.

14:01.592 --> 14:03.316
Some things just
can't be explained.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.792
Our friends think something
great happened to them

14:05.816 --> 14:08.860
while I was away. But no!
It was something awful!

14:10.492 --> 14:11.796
If we don't break the
spell they're under,

14:11.848 --> 14:13.572
who knows what terrible
things could happen?

14:13.700 --> 14:14.896
Spell?

14:15.050 --> 14:17.392
Come on, Spike! There's
no time to lose!

14:22.220 --> 14:25.588
Zecora, what do you think?
Can you undo Discord's magic?

14:28.916 --> 14:33.392
In what way can you tell that
they are indeed under a spell?

14:33.684 --> 14:36.336
They're having fun with
Discord; that's why.

14:36.820 --> 14:40.796
Ahh, a friendship with
Discord is truly a shock

14:41.060 --> 14:43.840
but who says it is something
that we must block?

14:43.996 --> 14:46.004
Trust me, they would
never laugh like that

14:46.024 --> 14:48.968
unless something magical was
involved. It's not that funny.

14:49.004 --> 14:50.676
I know funny.

14:55.892 --> 14:59.144
All right, this potion
will break the spell

14:59.448 --> 15:01.408
then you will be able to tell.

15:01.736 --> 15:06.032
Wait, if that's the potion, then
what's brewing in your cauldron?

15:06.196 --> 15:09.728
It ties the room together
and emits a warm glow

15:10.316 --> 15:13.712
but if I am to be honest,
it's just for show!

15:19.988 --> 15:22.524
I wonder why she asked us
here so bright and early.

15:22.728 --> 15:24.308
Another map adventure perhaps?

15:29.320 --> 15:31.460
Nope. No glowing tushies here.

15:32.592 --> 15:34.536
Maybe it's more of
a non-adventure.

15:34.624 --> 15:37.640
Maybe she just wants to tell us
how last night's slumber went.

15:37.792 --> 15:38.884
Hey, gang!

15:39.464 --> 15:41.300
Ooh, you look excited.

15:41.604 --> 15:44.964
I am excited! We're
gonna have fun today!

15:45.140 --> 15:46.384
Yes!

15:46.660 --> 15:49.912
Just one tiny, miniscule,
microscopic thing

15:49.936 --> 15:50.988
before fun times.

15:51.016 --> 15:53.484
I need everypony
to sip this potion

15:53.508 --> 15:55.152
to break Discord's spell on you.

15:56.544 --> 15:57.356
Uh, what now?

15:57.596 --> 16:01.276
Don't be embarrassed. So what
if Discord cast a spell on you

16:01.296 --> 16:03.016
so you THOUGHT you
had a great time

16:03.268 --> 16:05.012
and now you have all
these inside jokes

16:05.036 --> 16:07.776
that you seem to be
constantly laughing at.

16:07.808 --> 16:11.864
Don't worry, you didn't have
your defenses up; I get it.

16:14.180 --> 16:14.920
You're kidding.

16:15.252 --> 16:18.836
Twilight, darling, we simply
had a nice time with Discord.

16:19.092 --> 16:21.236
As I recall, we spent much
of yesterday afternoon

16:21.256 --> 16:22.676
re-enacting it for you.

16:23.180 --> 16:26.656
Uh-huh. Or you re-enacted
what you thought was fun

16:26.828 --> 16:29.236
but really wasn't because
you were under a spell

16:29.260 --> 16:31.520
that made you think
what happened was fun.

16:32.856 --> 16:35.608
What kind of fertilizer have
you had your nose in, Twilight?

16:36.048 --> 16:38.552
Be honest; the only reason
you won't drink the potion

16:38.740 --> 16:40.960
is because deep down in your
hearts you know there's a chance

16:40.984 --> 16:42.796
that Discord has
you under his power.

16:42.904 --> 16:45.652
Twilight! How could
you say such a thing?

16:45.788 --> 16:48.268
I know Discord still
makes mistakes sometimes,

16:48.528 --> 16:51.480
but you're accusing him
of being downright evil.

16:51.632 --> 16:54.384
Yeah! And to top it
off, you're accusing us

16:54.456 --> 16:56.968
of not being able to tell
he was up to something.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.024
What do you take us for?

16:58.472 --> 17:02.764
Yeah. What do
you... take us for?

17:04.792 --> 17:07.168
Delicious! Got any
more, Twilight?

17:07.628 --> 17:09.012
Hi, Twilight.

17:09.112 --> 17:12.528
The gang mentioned we'd all be
hanging out together today.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.184
The gang?

17:14.424 --> 17:17.976
Yeah, the peanut
butter hoof gang!

17:22.412 --> 17:23.956
It's still funny!

17:25.556 --> 17:27.480
So much for that
whole spell theory.

17:32.116 --> 17:35.236
Ugh! It's still not funny!

17:35.708 --> 17:36.976
It's funny if you were there.

17:37.380 --> 17:41.016
But I wasn't there!
I wasn't included.

17:41.220 --> 17:42.640
Maybe it's my own
fault for staying in

17:42.660 --> 17:44.304
and having a booksortacation
when I could have been

17:44.324 --> 17:46.920
making jokes and memories
with my friends.

17:47.412 --> 17:50.000
But I didn't do that,
did I? You all did.

17:50.096 --> 17:51.360
You were all there but--

17:53.952 --> 17:56.680
I wasn't there. I missed out.

17:57.608 --> 18:00.384
And seeing you having all
these jokes I wasn't a part of

18:00.404 --> 18:01.912
and couldn't
understand made me...

18:02.040 --> 18:02.920
Jealous?

18:03.608 --> 18:06.972
No. The Princess of
Friendship can't get jealous.

18:07.444 --> 18:08.860
Sure you can, Twilight. And
none of us begrudge you for it.

18:11.804 --> 18:14.492
We're sorry if we made
you feel left out.

18:15.276 --> 18:16.808
You didn't do anything wrong.

18:17.328 --> 18:19.832
You're allowed to share
things that don't include me.

18:20.668 --> 18:23.320
And you're allowed to feel
a little jealous about it.

18:23.540 --> 18:25.956
You just have to be able to
admit that's what you're feeling

18:26.004 --> 18:27.328
so you can let it go.

18:27.904 --> 18:30.832
And, you know, not try to
make us recreate everything

18:30.848 --> 18:32.620
that happened when
you weren't around.

18:33.448 --> 18:35.092
Of course, none of this
would have happened

18:35.260 --> 18:39.472
if I hadn't encouraged everypony
not to invite you this weekend.

18:40.648 --> 18:42.156
They wanted me to be there?

18:42.760 --> 18:44.864
And you convinced
them to not invite me?

18:45.628 --> 18:47.824
Well, I didn't think that
they should interrupt you.

18:47.956 --> 18:53.996
But now I see that we should
have. Oh, I feel just terrible.

18:55.584 --> 18:58.288
You don't look like
you feel terrible.

18:59.992 --> 19:00.800
Better?

19:01.584 --> 19:02.920
Wait a minute.

19:03.164 --> 19:05.356
You didn't suggest
not inviting Twilight

19:05.376 --> 19:08.400
cause you wanted to make
her feel left out, did you?

19:08.568 --> 19:09.408
Of course not!

19:09.816 --> 19:12.680
That whole jealousy thing
was just a happy accident.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.804
Certainly we can all agree
that Princess Twilight

19:16.832 --> 19:18.776
learned a valuable lesson here.

19:18.988 --> 19:21.840
That even she can have
feelings of jealousy.

19:22.524 --> 19:24.556
That she should
recognize said feelings

19:24.572 --> 19:28.280
rather than try to pretend
that she doesn't have them?

19:29.724 --> 19:31.920
Did I get the tiniest bit
of glee out of watching her

19:31.944 --> 19:35.336
try to recreate our weekend of
fun in the name of "science"?

19:35.892 --> 19:38.888
Oh, most definitely.

19:39.764 --> 19:43.612
But what's important here is
that it was never my intent

19:43.664 --> 19:45.096
to make Twilight feel jealous.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.684
That's something the old
me would have tried to do.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.804
Orange you glad I've changed?

19:58.840 --> 20:03.636
I said "Orange you
glad I've changed?"

20:06.576 --> 20:09.644
Orange! Like the ones
at the Applejack farm.

20:10.636 --> 20:11.568
From this weekend.

20:13.656 --> 20:16.192
No? Nothing? Really?

20:16.500 --> 20:19.272
I thought you'd find
this hisss-sterical.

20:23.132 --> 20:26.884
Yes, no. Discord, I think these
jokes have run their course.

20:27.092 --> 20:29.064
Only way we'd find
them funny now is

20:29.096 --> 20:31.304
if you put us all under
some kind of spell.

20:31.608 --> 20:34.644
Come on! You'd have to
be a complete crazy pony

20:34.660 --> 20:36.240
to think he'd do
something like that.

20:36.552 --> 20:38.148
What are you going
to say next, Pinkie?

20:38.244 --> 20:41.068
That we'd all have to drink some
weird potion to break the spell?

20:43.808 --> 20:45.868
What's so funny?

20:46.248 --> 20:50.920
Come on, Discord, do we really
have to spell it out for you?

20:56.628 --> 20:57.940
I don't get it.

20:58.216 --> 21:01.668
Somepony want to tell me
what's so hilarious? Anypony?

21:02.868 --> 21:08.396
Hello? I'm talking to
you! You and you, you!

21:08.800 --> 21:11.184
Well, what's funny about spells?

21:11.376 --> 21:16.328
I don't get it; I feel left out
and I feel really bad about it.

21:16.916 --> 21:19.348
Sorry, buddy. Guess
you had to be there.
