WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:05.810
Ah, found them!

00:09.580 --> 00:10.700
Gesundhoof.

00:10.850 --> 00:13.000
Why, thank you, Applejack.

00:13.150 --> 00:17.150
I still can't believe
it's been almost 100 moons

00:17.300 --> 00:19.400
since our last
family reunion.

00:19.550 --> 00:22.510
Oh, I remember it
like it was yesterday.

00:22.660 --> 00:26.250
Well, you have been talking about it
pretty much every day since then.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.670
Apple Bloom, how are them
RSVPs coming along?

00:29.820 --> 00:32.270
Who's showing their muzzle
at the reunion?

00:32.420 --> 00:33.580
Everypony!

00:33.730 --> 00:36.780
Everypony?
Feathers on a goat.

00:36.930 --> 00:37.800
Are you sure?

00:37.950 --> 00:40.480
Well, I got RSVPs from

00:40.630 --> 00:42.840
Apples from Yonderhill,
Hollow Shades,

00:42.990 --> 00:44.810
Galloping Gorge,
Foal Mountains,

00:44.960 --> 00:47.640
Apples from Fillydelphia,
Tall Tale Town,

00:47.790 --> 00:49.670
and all the Apples
from Appleloosa.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.620
Oh, and how could I forget?

00:52.770 --> 00:55.230
Manehattan!
Babs is coming.

00:55.380 --> 00:57.510
I get to see my favorite cousin!

00:57.660 --> 01:00.700
I think we're gonna need
a bigger cider trough.

01:04.110 --> 01:09.110

01:41.820 --> 01:45.740
Looks like the family's grown tenfold
since the last reunion.

01:45.890 --> 01:48.810
I'm gonna be busier than
a worm in a rotten tomato

01:48.950 --> 01:50.720
trying to get everything ready.

01:50.870 --> 01:52.080
I could always help out.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.920
- Me too!
- Eeyup.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.740
Oh, I sure would appreciate that.

01:56.890 --> 01:59.000
Granny's a little rustier
in the giddyap

01:59.150 --> 02:01.850
since the last time
the Apples all got together.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.290
You may be a tad old, Granny,

02:07.440 --> 02:09.100
but you're as feisty
and full of spark as ever.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.560
Who you calling old?

02:10.710 --> 02:12.580
I-- I just meant,

02:12.730 --> 02:16.190
why don't you let me take over putting
the reunion together this time around?

02:16.340 --> 02:18.850
Then all you'll need to worry
about is enjoying yourself.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.350
All right, young 'un.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.650
You got yourself a deal.
You are in charge.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.290
I won't let you down, Granny.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.330
You just tell me what the reunion needs,
and I'll take care of the rest.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.500
I'll do better than tell you
what the reunion will need.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.600
I'll show ya!

02:35.270 --> 02:38.900
We've been hosting these things
at Sweet Apple Acres every 100 moons

02:39.050 --> 02:41.540
since we first planted roots
here in Ponyville.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.120
Hey, who's that?

02:43.270 --> 02:46.350
That'd be your great great
Auntie Applesauce

02:46.500 --> 02:48.490
when she was just about your age.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.000
Now she used to
go by another name,

02:50.150 --> 02:52.310
but everypony
started calling her Applesauce

02:52.460 --> 02:55.020
after half her teeth fell out
when she was making apple jam.

02:55.170 --> 02:58.740
Yeah. Never did find
them teeth in all those jars.

02:58.890 --> 03:00.860
Hey, that's you, Granny!

03:01.130 --> 03:03.010
Sure is.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.950
Apple family's been working
on that same old quilt

03:06.100 --> 03:08.820
since our first reunion.

03:08.970 --> 03:09.940
I can do it!

03:17.940 --> 03:20.130
Oh, fingle-fangle!

03:23.400 --> 03:27.600
Well, nopony told me I actually
had to knot the end of the thread!

03:27.750 --> 03:29.930
Okay, so I'll need to get
new quilting materials.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.050
Fabric, needles, thread.

03:32.350 --> 03:36.100
You've really been working on
the same quilt since the first reunion?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.310
Surely have.

03:37.460 --> 03:40.110
I don't think we're ever gonna
finish that doggone thing.

03:42.030 --> 03:43.990
Hey, what's going on here?

03:44.140 --> 03:47.150
Well, you know us Apples
enjoy a good fritter.

03:52.058 --> 03:52.610
Hot, hot, hot!

03:57.500 --> 04:00.120
Hey, where'd all them
apple fritters go?

04:01.210 --> 04:03.400
And, who are you, little one?

04:03.550 --> 04:06.470
I'm Applejack.
More apple fritter?

04:08.160 --> 04:11.170
That's how we figured out
your sister had the appetite

04:11.320 --> 04:12.700
of a full-grown stallion.

04:12.850 --> 04:15.000
Better get twice as much
honey and flour, then,

04:15.150 --> 04:18.260
50 more buckets of apples,
more oil, wood for the fire.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.030
Now, stick an apple in my mouth
and roast my rump!

04:22.180 --> 04:25.030
This one sure
brings back memories.

04:25.180 --> 04:27.950
You know how Babs
is your favorite cousin?

04:28.100 --> 04:29.890
Well, Apple Rose is mine.

04:30.050 --> 04:34.200
<i>The two of us entered the
seven-legged race every reunion.</i>

04:34.350 --> 04:36.550
We're gonna win this one,
cousin.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.540
You bet your hot diggity
derriere we are!

04:39.690 --> 04:41.920
Come on, cousin,
speed it on up!

04:53.950 --> 04:56.840
Never won a single one
of them races.

04:56.990 --> 05:00.110
Races. We'll need
cloth ties, a finish line.

05:00.260 --> 05:02.140
Not much to a seven-legged race.

05:02.590 --> 05:06.530
And of course we can't forget
to take the big family photo.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.400
We always snapped a photo
in front of the barn

05:08.550 --> 05:10.500
at the end of every reunion.

05:10.650 --> 05:12.580
It lets us see how
our family's grown.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.540
Photo in front of the barn, got it.

05:14.690 --> 05:17.740
You sure have some great memories
of these reunions, don't you?

05:17.890 --> 05:21.580
Indeedy, and I'm looking forward
to making more at this one.

05:21.730 --> 05:24.580
Oh, I'm sure everypony is,
and I do mean everypony.

05:24.730 --> 05:27.150
We got the whole family
together this time around.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.980
Who knows if they'll all be
able to make the next one?

05:31.010 --> 05:32.440
That's true!

05:32.590 --> 05:34.850
Busy as everypony's lives
are getting these days,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.750
chances are pretty slim we'll
be this lucky next time around.

05:38.260 --> 05:39.540
Don't worry, Granny,

05:39.690 --> 05:42.270
I'm gonna make sure this is
the most memorable reunion

05:42.420 --> 05:43.540
we've ever had.

05:43.690 --> 05:46.230
I better get started.
I've got some planning to do.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.900
Oh, hootenanny, would you look
what your second cousin

05:51.050 --> 05:52.490
is wearing on her head.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.500
Apple Bloom,
what are you doing up?

06:06.650 --> 06:09.500
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

06:09.650 --> 06:10.730
I can't sleep.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.090
My gears are turning in my head
about this reunion.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.300
Yeah, I can't wait
to see my cousin Babs.

06:17.450 --> 06:20.440
We're gonna do
so many fun things together.

06:20.590 --> 06:22.920
Fun? That's just
the beginning of it.

06:23.070 --> 06:25.220
Granny Smith handed me
the reins of this reunion,

06:25.370 --> 06:26.480
and I'm gonna make
the most of it.

06:26.980 --> 06:29.100
Apple Bloom, I've got
so many things planned,

06:29.250 --> 06:31.100
you won't even have
a minute's rest!

06:35.620 --> 06:37.350
Trust me, little sis.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.100
This reunion I'm putting together
is gonna be worth the wait.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.840
Rise and shine!
We don't have much time!

07:22.180 --> 07:24.320
Don't forget the glitter!

07:55.610 --> 07:58.820
- Think that'll do it!
- And just in time too.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.650
They're here!

08:09.450 --> 08:11.410
Apple Rose!

08:13.900 --> 08:16.670
Oh, this is more exciting
than when it rained frogs!

08:30.410 --> 08:31.450
Howdy, y'all!

08:31.600 --> 08:33.980
And welcome
to the Apple Family Reunion!

08:36.400 --> 08:37.740
My name's Applejack,

08:37.890 --> 08:41.910
and I just wanted to let y'all know
that I got a real big day planned for you.

08:42.060 --> 08:44.660
We're gonna start off with an
obstacle course for the young 'uns

08:44.810 --> 08:48.210
and some fritter making and quilting
for the not-so-young 'uns.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.250
And there's lots more to come
after that.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.550
Hope y'all enjoy it!

08:53.450 --> 08:54.710
Where is she?

08:57.880 --> 08:59.880
- Babs!
- Coz!

09:00.540 --> 09:03.600
I know it's hasn't been that long
since we've seen each other but--

09:03.750 --> 09:05.720
- It felt like forever!
- It felt like forever!

09:05.850 --> 09:08.250
I can't wait to tell you
about my new school!

09:08.400 --> 09:10.150
I can't wait to hear all about it!

09:10.300 --> 09:13.100
Jeepers, where do I start?
Okay, so first day--

09:13.250 --> 09:15.640
Babs!
So glad you could come.

09:15.790 --> 09:19.250
What am I, gonna miss out on
spending time with my favorite cousin?

09:19.400 --> 09:21.150
Forget about it!

09:21.300 --> 09:23.400
Why don't you two head over
to the obstacle course?

09:23.550 --> 09:25.740
We kinda want to catch up
a little bit first.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.050
Don't you worry.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.950
There'll be plenty of time
for family bonding

09:29.100 --> 09:31.080
while you're racing against
your other cousins!

09:33.500 --> 09:36.260
All righty, ponies,
ready to have some fun?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.250
Wow, is that the finish line?!

09:38.530 --> 09:40.920
It's like a mile away or something!

09:41.070 --> 09:42.450
Actually, that's just the marker

09:42.600 --> 09:44.700
where you go on to
the next leg of the race.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.350
- There's more?
- Much more. Trust me.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.300
I have put together something
you are never gonna forget!

09:51.310 --> 09:52.690
After the seven-legged race,

09:52.840 --> 09:54.900
you're gonna want to hurry up
and head over here

09:55.050 --> 09:56.860
where you'll be bobbing for apples.

09:57.810 --> 10:00.310
Then you'll run around
these trees 50 times

10:00.460 --> 10:02.400
until you're real good and dizzy.

10:02.550 --> 10:05.150
Then you'll jump
these big wooden hurdles,

10:05.300 --> 10:07.530
and then there's the final leg

10:07.680 --> 10:09.590
where you'll balance plates
on your head while saying,

10:09.740 --> 10:11.370
"pappy pony picked a pluck
of pickly pluffnuggets"

10:11.520 --> 10:13.580
over and over and over again.

10:14.170 --> 10:16.840
The last pony standing wins.

10:18.620 --> 10:19.620
Seriously?

10:19.770 --> 10:23.500
Seriously. Come on, y'all, let's
start making some memories.

10:23.650 --> 10:27.460
On your mark, get set, go!

10:39.150 --> 10:40.800
Looking good, everypony.

10:41.670 --> 10:43.430
Better go check on the quilt.

10:44.650 --> 10:48.850
How long you had those new
chompers, Auntie Applesauce?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.170
A lady never reveals
the age of her teeth.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.760
Don't you roll your eyes at me,
Miss Apple Rose.

10:56.910 --> 10:59.250
I imagine you two think
I have forgotten

10:59.400 --> 11:03.330
what you did to my
parasol six reunions ago!

11:04.460 --> 11:07.760
We were just using it to help
break open that pinata!

11:11.560 --> 11:14.390
Applejack, delightful to see you.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.770
Are you gonna join us
in some quilting?

11:16.920 --> 11:19.760
Sorry, Auntie Applesauce,
I am busy, busy, busy.

11:19.900 --> 11:20.940
Y'all should get started though.

11:21.590 --> 11:24.490
We couldn't find
our rocking chairs.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.620
I got rid of them
to make room for these.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.160
This is the year y'all are finally
gonna finish that quilt.

11:31.310 --> 11:32.440
Finish it?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.880
Won't that be exciting?

11:43.030 --> 11:44.500
What's that?

11:44.650 --> 11:47.210
I said, won't that be...

11:48.100 --> 11:49.480
exciting?

11:50.470 --> 11:51.590
I suppose,

11:51.740 --> 11:54.310
although I have been told
that too much excitement

11:54.460 --> 11:57.850
can wreak havoc on this
youthful complexion of mine.

12:05.490 --> 12:06.780
That's the spirit!

12:06.930 --> 12:08.350
What did she say?

12:08.500 --> 12:09.250
What?

12:09.400 --> 12:10.820
Good gracious!

12:10.970 --> 12:14.830
Golden Delicious?
I think he's racing with his cousins.

12:21.710 --> 12:24.050
How is Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle?

12:24.200 --> 12:25.350
Great!

12:26.390 --> 12:27.760
You all right?

12:27.910 --> 12:30.000
So dizzy...

12:48.030 --> 12:50.650
You've got eight now, don't ya?

12:50.800 --> 12:52.150
Oh sure do.

12:52.300 --> 12:56.680
Tell you what, my Apple Tart
may just be a baby, but he is a hoot!

12:56.830 --> 12:59.300
- Having fun?
- Sure are!

12:59.450 --> 13:01.730
Better pick up the pace
on these fritters though, huh?

13:02.870 --> 13:04.950
Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.800
Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left.

13:07.950 --> 13:09.090
Now you try!

13:12.390 --> 13:15.300
That's it! Gotta keep this
assembly line moving, gals.

13:15.450 --> 13:17.050
We want every Apple here
to get the chance

13:17.200 --> 13:19.720
to taste the best
darn fritters in Equestria!

13:19.870 --> 13:21.850
Pappy pony picked
a pluck of pickly pluffnuggets!

13:22.000 --> 13:23.930
Any other blankflanks
at your new school?

13:24.080 --> 13:24.800
Yeah, two.

13:24.950 --> 13:27.040
Pappy pony picked
a pluck of pickly pluffnuggets!

13:27.190 --> 13:28.940
- Do they want to be Crusaders?
- Totally!

13:29.100 --> 13:31.500
Great! Pappy pony picked a pluck
of pickly pluffnuggets!

13:31.650 --> 13:35.750
Pappy pony picked a pluck
of pickly pluffnuggets!

13:35.900 --> 13:37.670
I can't feel my tongue.

13:37.820 --> 13:39.370
Me neither...

13:41.680 --> 13:43.830
All right, Apples, break!

13:49.790 --> 13:51.340
Finally...

13:51.490 --> 13:54.430
Ooh, can't forget to capture
all these memories for Granny's album!

13:55.200 --> 13:56.770
Nothing all that memorable there.

13:57.900 --> 13:58.940
Or there.

14:00.380 --> 14:01.930
Or there.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.020
Come on, Applejack, think.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.060
You gotta kick
this thing up a notch.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.700
I get that my big sis

14:12.850 --> 14:15.590
wants this to be like
a super awesome reunion,

14:15.740 --> 14:17.660
but that was ridiculous!

14:17.810 --> 14:20.100
I thought we'd never get
a minute to just hang out!

14:20.250 --> 14:21.580
And your minute's up!

14:21.730 --> 14:23.710
Your fellow Apples are waiting
for you to join them.

14:23.860 --> 14:27.120
Applejack, I haven't had
any time with Babs!

14:27.270 --> 14:29.400
We were so busy with
that obstacle course

14:29.550 --> 14:31.090
we didn't even get to talk!

14:31.230 --> 14:34.340
There'll be plenty of time to bond
with Babs when we do the hayride.

14:34.490 --> 14:36.000
Hayride?

14:36.820 --> 14:40.450
All right, everypony,
step right up, take a seat,

14:40.600 --> 14:42.970
and leave the driving
to these stallions.

14:43.380 --> 14:46.960
Now, I know y'all have been working real
hard making some awesome memories,

14:47.110 --> 14:48.690
and in all of our past reunions,

14:48.840 --> 14:52.110
we always had a nice and relaxing
hayride around the farm.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.490
Which is why I decided
to change things up a bit

14:56.640 --> 14:59.900
and try something
just a wee bit more exciting.

15:00.050 --> 15:01.990
So let's get this show
on the road!

15:02.140 --> 15:03.370
Giddyap!

15:16.930 --> 15:20.470
I just had those
professionally polished.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.480
Where in the world
does that girl have us headed?

15:23.630 --> 15:24.890
The west orchard?

15:27.200 --> 15:27.940
Eeyup.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.740
What?! I was joking.

15:29.890 --> 15:31.800
Why, we haven't
tended those fields

15:31.950 --> 15:34.300
since all the trees went
and got filled up with--

15:48.870 --> 15:52.260
Wowsa! I've never seen
real fruit bats before!

16:14.640 --> 16:17.860
Everypony, jump out!

16:41.320 --> 16:44.310
Ruined. Everything is ruined!

16:45.650 --> 16:48.930
Oh, Granny, I'm so, so sorry...

16:49.080 --> 16:51.600
Oh, it's all right, child.

16:51.750 --> 16:55.660
But it's not all right.
Just look at this!

16:55.810 --> 16:59.550
The barn, and all my plans
for the perfect family reunion

16:59.700 --> 17:01.650
are completely destroyed!

17:01.800 --> 17:03.690
Maybe that's a good thing.

17:04.310 --> 17:06.320
How can that possibly be
a good thing?

17:06.320 --> 17:10.210
Applejack, you've had us
so caught up in all the doing,

17:10.360 --> 17:12.900
we haven't had a second
to enjoy the company of the folks

17:13.050 --> 17:14.650
we've been doing it with!

17:14.800 --> 17:15.380
Really?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.800
Oh, Granny Smith,

17:19.950 --> 17:22.620
here, you let me be in charge
of creating great memories,

17:22.770 --> 17:26.100
and the only thing anypony's
gonna remember about this reunion

17:26.250 --> 17:30.100
is that it was the worst one
we ever had.

17:30.900 --> 17:34.940
Hey, now, everypony's
still here, ain't they?

17:35.100 --> 17:38.320
Still plenty of time
to make good memories.

17:38.470 --> 17:41.950
You just gotta give everypony
a chance to actually make them.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.100
The family photo!

17:45.250 --> 17:48.920
Guess we can't take it
in front of the barn this year.

17:49.070 --> 17:50.920
Unless...

17:51.070 --> 17:54.160
Everypony,
I have one more activity!

17:54.310 --> 17:56.700
Applejack...

17:56.850 --> 17:59.770
Trust me, Granny Smith,
this'll be one we'll remember

17:59.920 --> 18:02.070
for all the right reasons.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.270
<i>Raise this barn

18:11.420 --> 18:13.230
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

18:13.380 --> 18:15.050

18:17.000 --> 18:18.820
<i>Up, up, up
Go the beams</i>

18:18.970 --> 18:20.570
<i>Hammer those joints
Work in teams</i>

18:20.720 --> 18:22.350
<i>Turn 'em round quick
By the right elbow</i>

18:22.500 --> 18:24.080
<i>Grab a new partner
Here we go</i>

18:24.231 --> 18:25.300
Yeah!

18:25.450 --> 18:26.990
Come on, Apple family!

18:27.140 --> 18:31.000
Let's get to it! Whoo-hoo!

18:31.670 --> 18:33.450
<i>Raise this barn

Recycling wood</i>

18:41.030 --> 18:42.840
<i>Working hard
You're doing good</i>

18:42.990 --> 18:44.540
<i>Turn 'em round quick
By the right elbow</i>

18:44.690 --> 18:46.150
<i>Grab your partner

18:55.740 --> 18:57.400
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

18:57.550 --> 18:59.190
<i>Slats of wood
Come off the ground</i>

18:59.340 --> 19:01.020
<i>Hold 'em up
And nail 'em down</i>

19:01.170 --> 19:02.970
<i>Turn 'em round quick
By the left elbow</i>

19:03.120 --> 19:04.650
<i>Grab a new partner
Here we go</i>

19:05.340 --> 19:07.520
Come on, Apples!
Get her done!

19:08.640 --> 19:10.350
<i>Look at us
We're family</i>

19:10.500 --> 19:12.050
<i>Working together thankfully</i>

19:12.200 --> 19:14.160
<i>We Apples
We are proud to say</i>

19:14.310 --> 19:15.870
<i>Stick together the pony way</i>

19:16.020 --> 19:17.630
<i>Bow to your partner
Circle right</i>

19:17.780 --> 19:19.550
<i>Get down
If you're scared of heights</i>

19:19.700 --> 19:21.100
<i>Forward, back
And twirl around</i>

19:21.250 --> 19:23.010
<i>That barn's gonna be
The best in town</i>

19:23.160 --> 19:24.110
Yeah!

19:24.260 --> 19:26.960
Yee-haw! Attagirl!

19:27.110 --> 19:29.170
Alright, let's get to it!

19:30.760 --> 19:32.640
<i>Raise this barn
Raise this barn</i>

19:32.790 --> 19:34.310
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

19:34.460 --> 19:36.320
<i>Together
We can raise this barn</i>

19:36.470 --> 19:38.100
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

19:38.100 --> 19:39.880
<i>Take your brushes
Young and old</i>

19:40.030 --> 19:41.650
<i>Together
Paint it bright and bold</i>

19:41.800 --> 19:43.570
<i>Turn 'em round quick
By the left elbow</i>

19:43.720 --> 19:45.450
<i>Grab a new partner
Here we go</i>

19:49.600 --> 19:52.300
<i>We raised this barn
We raised this barn</i>

19:52.450 --> 19:54.250
<i>Yes, we did</i>

19:54.400 --> 19:57.490
<i>Together
We sure raised this barn</i>

19:57.640 --> 19:59.250
<i>Yes, we did</i>

20:00.040 --> 20:02.600
<i>Being together
Counts the most</i>

20:02.750 --> 20:05.380
<i>We all came here
From coast to coast</i>

20:05.530 --> 20:08.870
<i>All we need to strive to be</i>

20:09.020 --> 20:11.010
<i>Is part of the Apple</i>

20:11.160 --> 20:16.900
<i>Family</i>

20:17.050 --> 20:18.670
Yeah!

20:32.410 --> 20:35.000
I can't wait for the next reunion!

20:35.150 --> 20:36.230
Me neither.

20:36.380 --> 20:39.430
I mean, obviously we have
to get together before then.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.470
Obviously.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.840
Oh, you did it, Applejack.

20:44.990 --> 20:48.140
You put on a reunion that
everypony will remember.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.560
Just had a couple minor hiccups
along the way.

20:50.710 --> 20:53.490
Yeah, just a couple.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.530
That's a good one.

20:59.980 --> 21:02.140
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

21:02.290 --> 21:05.500
<i>today I learned a great lesson
about family,</i>

21:05.650 --> 21:07.100
<i>which if you think about it,</i>

21:07.250 --> 21:09.680
<i>is really the first group
of friends you ever make.</i>

21:09.830 --> 21:12.910
<i>Turns out that when you are
with folks you care about,</i>

21:13.050 --> 21:15.550
<i>you don't have to do much
to make that time memorable.</i>

21:15.700 --> 21:19.250
<i>Even the simplest of activities
can take on a whole lot of meaning,</i>

21:19.400 --> 21:21.650
<i>and you'll find that
you remember the who</i>

21:21.800 --> 21:24.830
<i>long after
you've forgotten the what.</i>

21:25.500 --> 21:28.510
<i>Your humble subject,
Applejack.</i>
