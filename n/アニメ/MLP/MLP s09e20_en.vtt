the office, Ms. Philodendron.

Oh! I'm going to
call you Phyllis!

00:08.843 --> 00:10.709

look good, Phyllis.

[cough]
[normal voice]
I mean, uh, come in!

00:16.083 --> 00:18.450
Uh, were you just
talking to someone?

00:18.652 --> 00:20.119
No. Why? Heh.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.622
Starlight, I have something very
important to discuss with you.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.424
If this is about
leaving early yesterday,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.259
I didn't have any
students on my schedule

00:27.361 --> 00:29.161
and Trixie was having
a "magical emergency,"

00:29.263 --> 00:30.562
which actually turned
out to be nothing.

00:31.632 --> 00:32.965
It's not anything
like that!

00:34.735 --> 00:35.501
Ahem!

00:35.603 --> 00:37.870
Twilight Sparkle, the
Princess of Friendship,

00:37.972 --> 00:39.405
in light of her
impending ascension

00:39.507 --> 00:42.241
to the throne of Equestria
and in anticipation

00:42.343 --> 00:45.277
of her many duties and
responsibilities forthwith,

00:45.379 --> 00:47.113
does hereby intend
to make good

00:47.215 --> 00:50.349
on her previous offer to
you, Starlight Glimmer,

00:50.451 --> 00:54.687
of replacing her as Headmare
of the School of Friendship!

00:54.889 --> 00:57.356
I want you to take over the
school when I move to Canterlot.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.490
I KNOW!

00:58.592 --> 01:00.726
It's just so.. amazing!

01:00.928 --> 01:01.794
I'm a little...

01:01.996 --> 01:03.429
Do you think I'm
really up for it?

01:03.531 --> 01:04.330
Of course you do.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.199
I've covered for you every
time you've had to run off

01:06.301 --> 01:09.068
and save Equestria,
but, I mean, yes!

01:09.270 --> 01:10.669
Of course!
Thank You!

01:13.674 --> 01:14.740
You're welcome.

01:14.842 --> 01:18.143
And I can't think of any pony
who'd be better for the job.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.013
I'm a little nervous,
and excited,

01:21.315 --> 01:22.448
I'm mostly just
nervous.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.549
I understand.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.818
Of course I'll have a lot of
important responsibilities

01:25.920 --> 01:28.687
as ruler of Equestria, but
I'll always be available

01:28.789 --> 01:30.422
to help whenever
you need.

01:32.894 --> 01:35.060
Are you supposed to be at
a Royal Etiquette lesson

01:35.162 --> 01:36.629
with Celestia and
Luna right now?

01:36.731 --> 01:39.498
Right! Can't underestimate the
important responsibility

01:39.600 --> 01:41.367
of Royal napkin
placement..!

01:44.471 --> 01:45.271
Wow.

I mean, no biggie,

01:48.142 --> 01:49.375

02:32.420 --> 02:34.153
You know I'm nothing but
proud that you've been

officially offered the
position of Headmare.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.690
[tentatively] Thanks...

02:37.992 --> 02:39.992
But, I can't
help wondering

02:40.094 --> 02:42.594
if it's going to cut into
our social schedule.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.029
What do you mean?

02:44.431 --> 02:45.965
Take now,
for example.

02:46.067 --> 02:49.034
Instead of heading to the
delightful lunch I had planned,

02:49.136 --> 02:51.437
we're striding with
determination toward

02:51.539 --> 02:54.173
what I can only assume
is Twilight's office.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.109
Obviously, our lunch
is super important,

02:57.211 --> 02:59.044
but so is taking
over the school

02:59.146 --> 03:01.780
and the only pony who's really
<i>run</i> the School of Friendship

03:01.882 --> 03:03.949
is the <i>Princess</i>
of Friendship.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.951
And I'm worried about
doing it all alone,

03:06.053 --> 03:08.187
so I want to get as much
advice from Twilight

03:08.289 --> 03:10.122
as I can while
she's still here.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.459
But Twilight's never
really done anything alone.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.128
She always has
her friends.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.596
But that just
gave me an idea!

03:17.698 --> 03:18.664
Thanks, Trixie!

03:18.766 --> 03:20.666
You can give good advice
when you don't mean to.

I know how busy you are, but
I wanted to talk to you

03:37.851 --> 03:40.319
about running the school

03:40.421 --> 03:43.122
I was a bit worried about
taking it over all on my own,

03:43.324 --> 03:46.392
but I just realized
YOU never did it alone.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.094
Having a friend help
out <i>is</i> pretty great.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.264
Exactly!

03:52.766 --> 03:56.935
So, what do you think about me
hiring a <i>Vice</i>-Headmare

03:57.037 --> 03:58.370
to help run things?

03:58.472 --> 04:00.773
I trust you to run the
school any way you want.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.908
And if that means
hiring a Vice-Headmare,

04:03.010 --> 04:04.676
I think it's a great idea.

04:04.778 --> 04:05.578
Really!?

04:05.780 --> 04:08.547
Like you said, I've always
had ponies around to help.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.616
And don't worry, you can
always call on me to--

04:10.718 --> 04:11.584

Rarity says you were supposed
to be at the boutique

five minutes ago for your second
fitting for the coronation gown.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.690
Ugh. How many fittings are
there going to be?

04:19.392 --> 04:20.459
A lot?

04:20.761 --> 04:23.295
Anyway, good luck finding
your Vice-Headmare.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.564
I know you'll pick the
right pony for the job.

04:28.302 --> 04:29.968
Wow. I heard the
whole thing

04:30.070 --> 04:33.338
and all I can say
is, I am humbled.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.174
Uh, why?

04:35.276 --> 04:36.775
I hadn't ever
considered it,

04:36.877 --> 04:38.810
but hearing you say it
out loud made me realize

04:38.912 --> 04:41.813
what a great and powerful
Vice-Headmare I'll be!

04:41.915 --> 04:45.651
Plus, we get to work <i>and</i>
socialize at the same time!

04:45.753 --> 04:47.953
Oh. Well, sure, that
would be fun, but

04:48.055 --> 04:49.922
I can't just
<i>give</i> you the job.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.491
Oh, oh, no. Of
course not..

04:52.693 --> 04:55.461
I imagine there's a lengthy
"process" to go through

04:55.563 --> 04:59.631
before you inevitably hire the
"best pony" for the position.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.666
Wink!

05:00.768 --> 05:01.700
Exactly..

05:01.802 --> 05:04.436

"Several." Wink.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.552
for the School of
Friendship's Vice-Headmare.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.755
Honestly, if you're looking
for somepony to fundraise,

05:23.857 --> 05:25.224
I can bring in
enough bits

05:25.326 --> 05:27.827
to have several buildings
named after me.

05:28.229 --> 05:30.929
Well, that's not the
<i>primary</i> responsibility

05:31.031 --> 05:32.164

05:32.466 --> 05:34.766
but anypony
is welcome to apply!

05:34.968 --> 05:36.735
I think the selection
process I've come up with

05:36.837 --> 05:38.604
is pretty special.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.440

Since you ALL have to prove
you have what it takes to be

05:47.348 --> 05:51.183
Vice-Headmare, I've designed
the interview in three stages.

05:51.585 --> 05:54.820
Each stage will test a different
skill the Vice-Headmare needs.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.856
Only those who do WELL will
move through the stages

05:57.958 --> 06:01.360
until finally the best
candidate rises to the top!

06:01.762 --> 06:05.430
So, without further ado,
it's time for stage one:

06:05.532 --> 06:07.332
Substituting for
the teachers!

06:10.838 --> 06:12.271
Once the students
get a sample

11:15.542 --> 11:17.509
but then you might
just be explaining

11:17.611 --> 11:19.410
that you appreciate
her high energy.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.647
Ah. Nope, Eeyup, er...

11:22.949 --> 11:23.915
Maybe?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.718
There seems to be a lot of
nuance here and I just want to

11:26.820 --> 11:29.854
make sure I understand
exactly what you're saying.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.156
So what are you saying?

11:31.458 --> 11:32.290
Uhhhhhh.

11:33.961 --> 11:37.028
Gallus doesn't need to
know I'm "proud" of him!

11:37.130 --> 11:38.763
And he certainly
doesn't need me

11:38.865 --> 11:41.500
trekking all the
way to Ponyville!

11:41.702 --> 11:44.469
Good! Because you're
no longer WELCOME!

11:44.571 --> 11:46.905
Oh! Well fine
with me!

11:48.308 --> 11:50.209
Trixie, what
happened!?

11:50.611 --> 11:53.378
I'm not sure, but we'll
have one less conference

11:53.480 --> 11:55.514
to worry about
next semester.

11:58.152 --> 12:00.285
I really appreciate
your honesty, Big Mac,

12:00.387 --> 12:01.320
and you're right.

12:01.422 --> 12:03.755
Parents expect a lot of
detailed communication

12:03.857 --> 12:05.223
when it comes
to their kids

12:05.325 --> 12:06.958
and if you aren't
comfortable with that,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.728
Vice-Headmare probably
isn't the job for you.

with Grandpa Gruff,

12:26.913 --> 12:29.514

I shall recover.

12:29.616 --> 12:33.051
Trixie, that's not exactly what
I wanted to talk to you about.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.754
You can't get into a
shouting match with parents!

12:35.856 --> 12:37.122
Or guardians.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.157
For the final stage of
the interview process,

12:39.259 --> 12:41.359
you'll each have to put
together a field trip

12:41.461 --> 12:43.395
and if you really
DO want the job,

12:43.497 --> 12:45.831
I need yours to
be exceptional

12:45.933 --> 12:48.266
because if I had to pick a
Vice-Headmare right now,

12:48.468 --> 12:50.068
it wouldn't be you.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.772
Oh, I see what
you're doing!

12:53.974 --> 12:57.342
Obviously, you're not going to
give the job to somepony else,

most exceptional field trip

13:12.025 --> 13:14.492

13:17.731 --> 13:21.366
Is it wrong for me to think
she might actually pull it off?

13:22.836 --> 13:24.269
Oh, don't answer that.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.176
Not looking forward
to the performance?

13:31.278 --> 13:33.244
I know Octavia
loves music,

13:33.346 --> 13:35.714
but a field trip to a
classical music performance

13:35.816 --> 13:38.249
isn't my idea of
an exciting time.

Au contraire.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.542
I could have easily taken
you to Froggy Bottom Bog.

But we don't need to leave

17:41.061 --> 17:42.427

was going.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.897
A lot better now.

17:47.099 --> 17:48.266
OK...

17:48.468 --> 17:50.368
I really wanted
it to be a friend,

17:50.470 --> 17:54.105
so I ended up pushing aside
some pretty big signs

17:54.207 --> 17:55.840
that it wasn't
gonna work out.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.476
Not everypony is

17:58.578 --> 18:01.179
but everypony has
something to contribute.

figuring out what.

What if you and your
friend can't figure it out?

18:05.752 --> 18:08.753
If you have a job to do, you
have to decide what's best

18:08.855 --> 18:10.989
and be upfront and honest,
even if that means

18:11.091 --> 18:13.124
you can't work with
a friend on it.

18:13.226 --> 18:17.595
So, I guess that means talking
to them at the beginning

18:17.697 --> 18:21.199
instead of stringing them along
until you get so frustrated

18:21.201 --> 18:24.635

I'm sorry for all
those things I said.

18:41.154 --> 18:43.388
I just really wanted
it to work out,

18:43.690 --> 18:46.124
even though I knew
it probably wouldn't.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.259
I should have said
something sooner.

help you with anything.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.901
You aren't terrible.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.037
And you have a lot
of great qualities.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.806
Maybe not Vice-Headmare
qualities,

19:01.908 --> 19:05.175
but great and powerful
friend qualities...

19:08.047 --> 19:11.249
Well, you really stand by
the ponies you care about.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.252
Gallus even said no creatures
EVER stuck up for him

19:14.354 --> 19:16.187

with Grandpa Gruff.

19:18.058 --> 19:20.158
It would have been nice to
run the school together,

19:20.360 --> 19:23.862
but not everypony is
right for every job.

19:25.064 --> 19:28.299
I know how you take your
responsibilities seriously.

19:28.501 --> 19:33.237

I wasn't exactly a perfect fit.

any better, nopony was.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.408

19:37.610 --> 19:41.079
Well, Dr. Hooves has decided to
go back to his experiments

19:41.181 --> 19:43.347
and Octavia is worried the
responsibilities of

19:43.449 --> 19:46.451
Vice-Headmare will take too
much time away from her music.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.854
Maybe getting a Vice-Headmare
was a bad idea..

19:49.956 --> 19:50.789
Starlight.

19:50.891 --> 19:53.824
Obviously, you'd like some help,
and hiring a Vice-Headmare

19:53.926 --> 19:55.326
IS a great idea.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.262
But.. who could it be?

19:57.664 --> 20:01.465
Well, you need somepony
who's responsible like you,

20:01.567 --> 20:04.135
and detail-oriented,
like Twilight.

20:04.337 --> 20:08.539
And smart, obviously, it
is a school after all.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.808
It would be nice if I
got along with them,

20:10.910 --> 20:13.278
since having it be a
friend can't work out.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.312
Maybe it can!

20:18.518 --> 20:21.118
...and I knew as soon as
I read Trixie's scroll

20:21.220 --> 20:23.554
that it was the exact right
thing for me to do.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.324
But what about being
Flurry Heart's Crystaler?

20:26.426 --> 20:29.060
Well, honestly, now that
Flurry Heart's a little older,

20:29.162 --> 20:30.695
there really isn't
much for me to do

20:30.797 --> 20:33.131
outside of the occasional
tradition or festival.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.000
And working at a school is what
I always thought I'd do,

20:36.302 --> 20:38.135
I mean, if you'll have me..

20:38.237 --> 20:39.603
Are you kidding!?

20:39.705 --> 20:40.705
You're hired!

20:40.807 --> 20:42.607
I had a feeling
this would work out.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.943
Oh, Trixie, thank
you so much!

20:45.345 --> 20:47.445

when I want to be

20:47.547 --> 20:50.615

when I don't mean to,

20:50.717 --> 20:53.117
