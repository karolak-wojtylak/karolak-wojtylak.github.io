Rules? Isn't trivia
just asking questions

02:12.165 --> 02:13.031
and answering them?

02:14.001 --> 02:16.768
The Trot is a <i>little</i>
more involved than that.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.438
Let's start with the
first category of rules:

02:19.540 --> 02:21.940
Categories! Rule 1:
Each category must be

02:22.042 --> 02:23.942
categorically designated
and thoroughly researched

02:24.044 --> 02:25.010
in all categorical...

02:25.246 --> 02:26.946
...participating
in Trivia Trot.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.515
And that wraps
up rule 41.6!

02:29.717 --> 02:32.151
Of course, the exception
to that, 41.6a,

02:32.253 --> 02:33.752
is interesting
itself because...

02:33.854 --> 02:35.353
Oh, look we're here!

02:37.291 --> 02:40.359
Oooh! I can't wait to see who
my partner's going to be!

02:40.561 --> 02:42.227
You don't get to
pick your own team?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.696
Rule 20.16b, Spike!

02:44.798 --> 02:47.433
To keep things fair, the
teams are randomly selected!

02:47.835 --> 02:50.836
20.16b. How
could I forget?

02:51.138 --> 02:52.871
And, based on the
regular attendees,

02:52.973 --> 02:54.439
I've charted every
potential teammate's

02:54.541 --> 02:55.641
strengths and weaknesses,

02:55.743 --> 02:57.709
plus my percentage of
winning with each one!

02:57.811 --> 03:01.513
Ha! I knew there'd be a chart!
Glad I'm just watching...

03:01.615 --> 03:03.515

handle being your teammate.

let me down, Spike!

But I'm glad you're
watching too.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.789
I'm going to need all
the support I can get

03:10.891 --> 03:12.491

03:17.598 --> 03:21.066
Well, well, well, if it
ain't our reigning champ.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.402
Think you can win again
this week, Twilight?

03:23.504 --> 03:26.305
Everypony here has a
different area of expertise,

03:26.407 --> 03:28.306
so it really is
anypony's game.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.775
But, YES!

03:31.645 --> 03:34.079
Then you'd better hope
you get paired with me,

03:34.181 --> 03:36.781

rule this game!

03:36.918 --> 03:38.851
Sunburst: We'll just see
about that.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.788
I didn't come all the way from
the Crystal Empire to lose.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.591
And I hope you realize I
have the highest percentage

03:45.693 --> 03:48.460

aim to keep it that way!

03:48.562 --> 03:49.394
Pfffft!

03:49.496 --> 03:52.364
I hope YOU realize
not every category

03:52.466 --> 03:54.166

be the partner I expected,
