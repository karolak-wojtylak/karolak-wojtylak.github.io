00:28.170 --> 00:32.440
Well, don't stop there! You
read; I pack. That's the deal!

00:32.890 --> 00:35.600
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.
I just keep thinking about

00:35.630 --> 00:36.940
how much fun you're
going to have

00:36.970 --> 00:38.480
at the Daring
Do Convention.

00:38.850 --> 00:40.970
I wish Princess Celestia
didn't need my help

00:41.050 --> 00:43.230
with the friendship
summit in Griffonstone.

00:43.370 --> 00:47.250
Don't worry. I'll make sure
AK Yearling signs your book.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.080
I can't believe she's
going to be there.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.990
She never goes
to conventions.

00:53.810 --> 00:57.470
Which I guess will be cool for
all those other fan-ponies,

00:57.710 --> 01:01.270
but since you and I know
AK Yearling personally...

01:01.460 --> 01:04.930
...and we know that she's
secretly Daring Do, herself...

01:05.120 --> 01:06.140
It's no big deal.

01:06.350 --> 01:07.760
This convention'll be fun,

01:07.920 --> 01:10.920
but it's nothing to
get too excited about.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.060
So! Excited!

01:22.850 --> 01:27.850
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies
Episode released inside a pony convention!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

01:59.900 --> 02:02.590
You look like a pony who'd
be up for an all-inclusive,

02:02.630 --> 02:05.270
one-of-a-kind, adventu-cation
where you get to live

02:05.320 --> 02:07.640
"The Daring Do Experience."

02:07.830 --> 02:09.590
No thanks. Did
that already.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.680
Ah!

02:16.650 --> 02:18.240
This is the awe--

02:18.280 --> 02:19.770
--someest thing ever!

02:20.800 --> 02:23.970
Now this is something that only
a true fan can appreciate.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.360
They even put the tiles
in the right order!

02:27.150 --> 02:30.410
Good catch. I'm Quibble Pants.
Nice to meet you.

02:30.580 --> 02:33.110
Rainbow Dash.
Nice costume.

02:33.190 --> 02:34.070
You too.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.710
Thanks. The hard part was
figuring out the right--

02:36.790 --> 02:38.530
--number of arrow holes.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.493
B-because on page eighty-four
of Sapphire Stone,

02:41.560 --> 02:44.710
it describes her dodging a quote
"score of arrows shooting forth

02:44.770 --> 02:46.490
from holes in the
very walls," unquote,

02:46.530 --> 02:50.500
but then on page one hundred and
seven, Daring Do says she quote

02:50.590 --> 02:54.540
"barely made it past the trap's
barrage of arrows" unquote.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.440
But clearly, Daring
Do is embellishing

02:56.490 --> 02:58.230
and the correct
number of arrows is--

02:58.340 --> 02:59.550
Twenty.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.400
I am so glad I
ran into you.

03:34.620 --> 03:35.900
Even though I knew
the convention

03:35.950 --> 03:37.420
would be totally awesome,

03:37.580 --> 03:38.930
it's more fun when
you're with someone

03:38.990 --> 03:40.780
who really knows
Daring Do.

03:40.890 --> 03:42.240
I know what you mean.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.610
It's so hard to find a
pony who really gets it.

03:46.550 --> 03:49.110
That's weird. We've only done
stuff from the first trilogy.

03:49.370 --> 03:51.680
After lunch, we should probably
start working our way back

03:51.720 --> 03:52.650
through the other books.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa. There
are no "other books."

03:57.360 --> 03:58.570
Of course there are.

03:58.790 --> 04:00.660
Daring Do and the Trek
of the Terrifying Tower,

04:00.720 --> 04:02.020
Daring Do and the
Many Faces of--

04:02.070 --> 04:06.070
Uh, please, please don't. Just
don't even mention the titles.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.740
I'm not saying those
books don't exist.

04:07.780 --> 04:11.350
I'm saying that I refuse
to acknowledge them.

04:11.800 --> 04:12.630
Why?

04:12.880 --> 04:14.210
Because they're horrible!

04:14.300 --> 04:16.710
I mean, there isn't a single
thing after Ring of Destiny

04:16.760 --> 04:19.240
that is even remotely in
the realm of the possible.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.220
WHAT! I know for a
fact that everything

04:22.260 --> 04:25.500
in every one of those books is
one hundred percent possible!

04:25.960 --> 04:28.240
And how could you
possibly know that?

04:29.280 --> 04:30.720
I just do.

04:31.130 --> 04:33.690
Well, that's a
compelling argument!

04:33.840 --> 04:35.710
Why would you even
come to this convention

04:35.760 --> 04:37.450
if you hate Daring
Do so much?!

04:37.680 --> 04:39.780
I don't hate Daring Do.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.590
The first series
was smart and cool

04:42.650 --> 04:45.370
and an amazing nod to old-time
serialized adventure books

04:45.590 --> 04:48.580
that somehow manages to be
self-reflexive and ironic

04:48.790 --> 04:51.290
while at the same time
celebrating the art form

04:51.330 --> 04:52.950
without a hint of cynicism.

04:53.080 --> 04:56.950
Which is why I came here to ask
AK Yearling, muzzle-to-muzzle,

04:57.110 --> 04:59.920
why she sold out and dumbed
down the rest of her books

04:59.950 --> 05:03.210
into just a series of
impossible action sequences.

05:03.410 --> 05:05.840
OK, now I know
you're crazy.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.630
AK Yearling is awesome and every
Daring Do book that comes out

05:09.660 --> 05:11.120
is better than the last.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.800
Wow. OK. Yeah. I'm-I'm sorry
but I could never be friends

05:16.850 --> 05:19.610
with somepony who's willing
to believe impossible stuff

05:19.640 --> 05:22.630
is possible as long
as Daring Do does it.

05:22.730 --> 05:25.320
That's OK, because I could
never be friends with somepony

05:25.370 --> 05:27.810
who's so focused on
things being possible

05:27.900 --> 05:29.270
that he's willing
to turn his back

05:29.300 --> 05:31.200
on the coolest hero
of all time!

05:31.390 --> 05:31.980
Fine!

05:32.100 --> 05:32.790
Fine!

05:35.500 --> 05:39.220
Look, just tell AK Yearling
that Rainbow Dash is here

05:39.500 --> 05:41.760
and I need her help to
convince a know-it-all pony

05:41.803 --> 05:44.609
that everything Daring Do's
ever done actually happened.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.523
<i>Rainbow Dash?</i>

05:49.341 --> 05:52.080
AK! I've got to talk to
you! It's an emergency!

05:53.507 --> 05:54.326
Not here.

05:59.778 --> 06:03.624
Now, tell me what's going on. Is
it Caballeron? Did you see him?

06:03.993 --> 06:05.280
What? No.

06:05.470 --> 06:08.701
But there is a pony downstairs
who thinks everything

06:08.732 --> 06:11.544
you've written after the first
trilogy is totally unrealistic

06:11.581 --> 06:13.944
and terrible and I need
you to help me prove to him

06:14.070 --> 06:15.790
that it's all
totally possible.

06:16.073 --> 06:17.784
I've got bigger
problems on my hoofs

06:17.809 --> 06:19.735
than dissatisfied
fan-ponies.

06:21.304 --> 06:22.375
Whoa!

06:22.510 --> 06:26.080
The Amulet of Culhuacan.
And Caballeron wants it.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.824
But the amulet's
only a key.

06:29.450 --> 06:31.809
The real treasure is
hidden in a lost temple,

06:32.307 --> 06:34.873
The Seven-Sided
Chest of Chicomoztoc.

06:35.060 --> 06:38.055
Caballeron wants to sell it to
the highest bidder, of course,

06:38.307 --> 06:40.381
which is why I need
to find it first.

06:40.460 --> 06:43.969
YES! Sounds like another
awesome Daring Do Adventure!

06:44.516 --> 06:46.455
But what are
you doing here?

06:46.700 --> 06:48.424
Since I haven't
found the temple yet,

06:48.470 --> 06:50.504
it's the safest place
for me and the Amulet.

06:50.590 --> 06:53.193
It's crawling with security
and if I get into trouble,

06:55.410 --> 06:57.876
I can just blend in with all
the Daring Do cos-players.

06:58.410 --> 06:59.261
How can I help?

06:59.649 --> 07:02.455
Just keep your eyes out
for anything suspicious.

07:02.541 --> 07:03.021
Got it.

07:05.390 --> 07:08.141
Does a pony who only
likes your first trilogy

07:08.184 --> 07:09.698
qualify as suspicious?

07:11.710 --> 07:12.320
Just checking.

07:17.107 --> 07:21.969
I find all this fanfare around
my archenemy disturbing.

07:24.477 --> 07:27.579
I mean, where is the
booth for Caballeron?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.381
I do not see the likeness.

07:34.356 --> 07:37.649
Come. Let us find Daring Do
and the Amulet of Culhuacan.

07:37.944 --> 07:40.141
I don't want to spend any
more time in this place

07:40.178 --> 07:41.009
than I have to.

07:48.283 --> 07:51.667
Well, if it isn't the pony
who knows impossible things

07:51.698 --> 07:55.144
can happen because
she just does.

07:55.255 --> 07:58.830
Ugh. Sorry, Quibble, I've got
more important things to do

07:58.855 --> 07:59.870
than argue with a pony

07:59.889 --> 08:02.455
who thinks awesome
means unrealistic.

08:03.612 --> 08:07.206
No, wait. I wanna hear more
about how you're 100% sure

08:07.421 --> 08:09.827
that in Curse of the Jungle
Queen, Daring Do could survive

08:09.864 --> 08:13.027
a sixty-story drop from
the top of a waterfall

08:13.144 --> 08:16.590
after sustaining a broken
wing in a category six rapid.

08:16.787 --> 08:17.550
Ugh.

08:17.784 --> 08:20.086
Obviously her wing
wasn't broke--

08:20.707 --> 08:21.513
Caballeron!

08:22.289 --> 08:24.541
See, now THAT'S a
great character!

08:24.633 --> 08:27.335
Solid backstory.
Good motivations.

08:27.544 --> 08:29.846
No-no-no! Caballeron
is right there!

08:30.516 --> 08:32.326
Of course he is.

08:32.473 --> 08:34.880
He's also over
there, over there,

08:34.990 --> 08:38.990
Oh-oh over there,
and over there.

08:39.649 --> 08:40.843
Where are you going?

08:43.858 --> 08:46.572
And we're out here because...

08:46.769 --> 08:48.480
Daring Do told me
that Caballeron

08:48.510 --> 08:51.415
came to this convention to
steal the Amulet of Culhuacan

08:51.612 --> 08:54.301
and I just saw him and his
henchponies come this way.

08:54.590 --> 08:57.298
OK. I'm gonna head back inside.

08:57.489 --> 08:59.532
Just a little
too much crazy out here

08:59.575 --> 09:00.713
for the both of us.

09:07.846 --> 09:10.209
I do not know what
Daring Do is playing at,

09:10.498 --> 09:13.015
but if she told you two
fanponies of my plan

09:13.046 --> 09:16.904
to steal the Amulet,
you must work for her.

09:17.692 --> 09:21.384
Caballeron! HA! What do you
have to say NOW, Quibble?

09:21.581 --> 09:24.880
This was your plan to prove the
Daring Do books are realistic?

09:25.163 --> 09:28.935
You bought a "Daring Do
Experience, Adventu-cation"?

09:29.070 --> 09:29.778
Really?

09:30.024 --> 09:34.929
What?! NO! Look around us!
Henchponies. Caballeron!

09:35.070 --> 09:38.701
The jungle it took forever to
get to! This is the real deal!

09:38.818 --> 09:42.873
Right. We're ACTUALLY being
held captive by Caballeron.

09:43.126 --> 09:46.073
Please. This guy's accent
is all over the place.

09:46.553 --> 09:47.483
No offense.

09:47.716 --> 09:48.344
I....

09:48.480 --> 09:51.249
So, what's the setup,
here? You've kidnapped us

09:51.292 --> 09:54.461
and taken us to the middle
of nowhere because....?

09:54.689 --> 09:58.260
The Temple of Chicomoztoc is
somewhere in this jungle!

09:58.560 --> 10:02.516
When I find it, the Seven-Sided
Chest is as good as mine!

10:02.984 --> 10:06.393
I just need the Amulet of
Culhuacan to unlock it!

10:06.652 --> 10:09.126
Uh-huh. And Daring
Do has the Amulet,

10:09.181 --> 10:11.618
so you came up with this
overcomplicated plot

10:11.883 --> 10:14.947
to lure her into the jungle
and exchange it for us?

10:15.144 --> 10:18.387
I wouldn't call it
overcomplicated, but yes.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.443
OK, we're done here. Great work.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.076
Seriously. Very believable.

10:27.753 --> 10:30.627
Listen pal, you can keep
her money, but I'm not --

10:31.052 --> 10:32.510
Going anywhere.

10:32.730 --> 10:37.040
You may not approve of my plan,
but I'm the mastermind here.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.009
Debatable.

10:39.132 --> 10:42.455
AND I SAY you will remain
here until Daring Do

10:42.486 --> 10:45.993
comes to rescue you. And if she
wants you back in one piece,

10:46.024 --> 10:48.966
she will give me the
Amulet! Tie them up.

10:52.067 --> 10:53.396
The Griffon's Lock!

10:53.809 --> 10:54.732
You know of it!

10:54.781 --> 10:57.120
Further proof that you
are an agent of Daring Do.

10:57.495 --> 10:58.996
Or an avid reader.

11:01.181 --> 11:04.043
And now I will continue
my search for the Temple.

11:04.529 --> 11:10.436
Don't go anywhere.

11:10.941 --> 11:13.353
Listen, if I pretend to
believe this nonsense is real,

11:13.409 --> 11:17.224
will you call off the henchpony
repertory theater over there?

11:17.975 --> 11:20.904
They're not going to listen
to me. They abducted us BOTH!

11:20.981 --> 11:23.715
Oh, wow. So you're going
to stick with that script?

11:23.852 --> 11:27.027
Oh, OK fine. We're in
a Daring Do adventure.

11:30.763 --> 11:31.858
What was that?

11:32.258 --> 11:36.621
DARING DO! THANK
GOODNESS! WE'RE OVER HERE!

11:36.744 --> 11:40.190
Fan out! We can't let
Daring Do rescue these two.

11:42.215 --> 11:46.203
All four? I mean, shouldn't at
least one of them stay behind

11:46.227 --> 11:48.664
to guard us? Oh-oh
wait, no because then

11:48.775 --> 11:51.409
it wouldn't be a terrible
Daring Do adventure!

11:52.080 --> 11:53.126
It doesn't matter.

11:53.230 --> 11:55.735
We'll never solve the Griffon's
Lock before they get back.

11:58.633 --> 12:00.701
OK, that was pretty good.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.304
Quick! We've got to get out
of here and warn Daring Do!

12:03.723 --> 12:05.944
No way. Just point
me to the hotel

12:05.975 --> 12:08.307
and you can play fanpony

12:08.326 --> 12:10.301
and hunt treasure
out here all day long.

12:11.329 --> 12:15.329
Fine. Let's say this IS a
Daring Do Adventu-cation.

12:15.575 --> 12:18.609
The only way to get back to the
convention is to go through it.

12:18.812 --> 12:21.366
So just follow me and
I'll lead you out. Deal?

12:23.033 --> 12:24.436
Ugh. Fine.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.449
Maybe if I just leave you in
the jungle, it'll convince you.

12:29.710 --> 12:32.744
Which would make Daring Do left-
hoofed, which we KNOW is false!

12:32.763 --> 12:35.618
And THAT is everything
that's wrong with Daring Do

12:35.827 --> 12:37.335
and the Trek to the
Terrifying Tower.

12:37.433 --> 12:39.784
Now the problems with
the next book are even --

12:42.461 --> 12:45.796
Oh, right. What Daring Do
adventure would be complete

12:46.141 --> 12:49.286
without the precarious
rope bridge?

12:52.449 --> 12:55.170
Look, I'm all for making things
feel as real as possible

12:55.212 --> 12:59.040
but are these adventu-cation
ponies sure this thing is safe?

12:59.360 --> 13:01.686
Is it too "realistic" for you?

13:01.876 --> 13:04.492
Wouldn't want THAT on a
Daring Do adventure, would we?

13:04.732 --> 13:06.726
If this were really a
Daring Do adventure,

13:06.780 --> 13:10.092
I'm sure I'd step on the wrong
plank at exactly the wrong mo-

13:14.676 --> 13:16.615
Heh. Good thing this is all
just a pretend adventure.

13:16.867 --> 13:18.824
At least we know all
of this struggling

13:18.886 --> 13:20.381
won't make the
bridge fall apart.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.227
You need to get
your money back.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.378
Ha! How's THAT for
not possible!

13:47.723 --> 13:50.627
THAT. WAS. AWESOME!
I-I-I thought we...

13:50.812 --> 13:53.310
And then you...
and the flying...

13:53.378 --> 13:55.538
Wow, and I was like
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

13:55.563 --> 13:56.929
And then you swerved!

13:57.003 --> 14:01.735
And I was-was-was on the water!
And the-the rocks?! WOW.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.680
Yeah. If you read
that in a book

14:03.784 --> 14:06.104
you might even think
it was unrealistic.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.944
OK. I'll give
you that one.

14:07.987 --> 14:09.950
I mean we could
have been done for.

14:10.338 --> 14:11.600
We could have been
done for!

14:11.815 --> 14:13.452
What kind of
Adventu-cation IS this?

14:13.673 --> 14:17.396
I mean that's just bad business!
What are these ponies thinking?

14:17.538 --> 14:18.436
<i>Right now?</i>

14:19.175 --> 14:22.307
We are thinking that we should
thank you for escaping.

14:25.809 --> 14:31.187
For you have led us directly to
the Lost Temple of Chicomoztoc!

14:39.095 --> 14:40.849
Make sure they are
secure this time!

14:40.916 --> 14:42.418
We can't have them
escaping again.

14:43.963 --> 14:45.907
You'll never get
away with this.

14:46.123 --> 14:48.560
Won't I? You've led
me to the temple.

14:48.898 --> 14:52.713
And Daring Do is too noble to
let harm befall her companions

14:52.923 --> 14:56.313
so the amulet is
as good as mine.

14:57.163 --> 15:01.003
What? No witty remarks this time
about how silly my plan is?

15:01.366 --> 15:04.264
This isn't the official
Daring Do Experience

15:04.289 --> 15:05.963
Adventu-cation, is it?

15:06.080 --> 15:07.181
FINALLY!

15:07.353 --> 15:10.806
It's some cheap knock-off run by
a bunch of incompetent ponies

15:10.836 --> 15:13.206
that have no idea how to
execute this adventure

15:13.230 --> 15:14.590
with any level of safety!

15:15.735 --> 15:16.443
Ugh.

15:16.609 --> 15:19.747
What was that with the bridge!
We were in serious danger!

15:19.833 --> 15:21.846
I'm reporting you all to...

15:22.160 --> 15:23.735
Well, I don't know who
I'm reporting you to,

15:23.760 --> 15:25.618
but it's gonna be
somepony important!

15:26.006 --> 15:29.661
Oh, and this cut-rate
excuse for an "experience"

15:29.741 --> 15:31.593
hasn't proved anything
except that I'm right.

15:31.790 --> 15:34.904
It has all the hallmarks of
a lame Daring Do adventure.

15:37.175 --> 15:38.295
Uh... Quibble?

15:38.313 --> 15:41.569
No. I'M talking! Generic
jungle locations? Check.

15:41.963 --> 15:44.375
Overly complicated
villain plot? Check.

15:44.806 --> 15:47.070
Random coincidences
that conveniently

15:47.089 --> 15:49.563
get us to the next
big set piece? CHECK!

15:51.243 --> 15:53.415
Watch where you are
stepping, you fool!

15:53.544 --> 15:55.501
Listen, buddy, I
don't take orders

15:55.643 --> 15:58.215
from some second-rate
performer who learned acting

15:58.276 --> 16:00.910
from the supervillain
school of bad accents.

16:01.212 --> 16:03.944
The only thing this mess
is missing is some giant

16:04.012 --> 16:06.720
Ahuizotl wanna be monster
and I have a feeling

16:06.756 --> 16:08.110
that would be a bit too much

16:08.160 --> 16:11.033
for you bargain basement
adventurers to pull off.

16:16.436 --> 16:17.815
Um. You're real.

16:18.387 --> 16:19.544
This is real?

16:20.227 --> 16:22.018
THIS IS REAL!

16:33.963 --> 16:36.381
I told you to warn me
of anything suspicious,

16:36.732 --> 16:39.101
not run off on an
adventure without me.

16:39.347 --> 16:42.129
Whoa whoa whoa. You're real.

16:42.578 --> 16:44.449
You're-you're...
friends with her?

16:46.787 --> 16:48.763
Uh, we'll have to do
introductions later.

16:48.898 --> 16:49.901
Right now we have to--

16:49.956 --> 16:52.473
Get out of here. Yes! Thank you!

16:53.292 --> 16:54.510
Actually, no.

16:54.793 --> 16:55.587
WHAT?

16:55.938 --> 16:58.024
We can't leave
without the treasure.

16:58.381 --> 17:00.640
And we should probably get
to it before our friend

17:00.670 --> 17:01.704
gets any higher.

17:06.892 --> 17:08.147
Whoa!

17:08.529 --> 17:12.867
Seven doors, Seven locks. One
of them leads to the treasure.

17:13.089 --> 17:15.292
I'd rather not think about
what the others lead to.

17:15.593 --> 17:18.166
Yeah, yeah. The classic
pony and the tiger bit.

17:18.215 --> 17:19.440
All you have to do is--

17:19.483 --> 17:22.443
Um... Maybe you should let
Daring Do figure it out?

17:22.670 --> 17:24.418
Oh, excuse me.

17:29.206 --> 17:30.301
Not that one.

17:35.569 --> 17:37.673
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhh.

17:38.523 --> 17:40.049
Is he always like this?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.335
Yeah. But...he's
usually right.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.993
Which lock do YOU think it is?

17:46.615 --> 17:50.320
FINALLY! Look. Each door has
another door that matches.

17:50.467 --> 17:53.667
THESE two both have earth
ponies fighting serpents.

17:54.295 --> 17:56.750
THESE two have Pegasi
fighting Griffons.

17:57.076 --> 18:01.618
THESE two have unicorns
fighting bears. But THIS one...

18:02.929 --> 18:04.960
Has an alicorn on it!

18:05.120 --> 18:09.126
It's the only one without a
match. How did I miss that?

18:09.341 --> 18:12.036
I've been asking myself
that ever since book four.

18:17.815 --> 18:20.873
The Seven-Sided
Chest of Chicomoztoc.

18:23.187 --> 18:24.855
Uh, guys?

18:28.363 --> 18:29.833
The way out is
totally covered!

18:29.907 --> 18:31.476
How are we gonna
get out of here?

18:32.664 --> 18:33.390
There!

18:35.083 --> 18:36.775
Seriously, do you
ever NOT escape

18:36.800 --> 18:38.147
out of the top of a temple?

18:39.335 --> 18:41.883
We'll have to carry mister
adventure critic out with us.

18:42.006 --> 18:44.387
We won't be fast enough!
We'll never make it!

18:44.486 --> 18:45.144
Guys!

18:47.353 --> 18:49.218
I think Rainbow Dash
and I have this covered.

18:55.852 --> 18:58.633
Go around! You
can't go over him!

18:58.923 --> 19:01.218
Go over him? Are you crazy?

19:01.427 --> 19:04.658
If Quibble says go
over him, go over him!

19:11.532 --> 19:12.990
You two are insane!

19:13.261 --> 19:15.193
You SAID go over him!

19:15.316 --> 19:17.532
I SAID go around him!

19:17.704 --> 19:19.384
And I said be quiet!

19:19.981 --> 19:21.655
This way! I heard them!

19:22.664 --> 19:25.378
OK, I've got it. Let's
create a fake treasure

19:25.403 --> 19:28.504
out of mud and rocks, give THAT
to Caballeron and then when--

19:28.535 --> 19:32.098
Not EVERY Daring Do plan
has to be super complicated.

19:34.953 --> 19:36.486
I swear I heard them!

19:41.366 --> 19:45.064
I'll get you Daring Doooooooo!

19:47.729 --> 19:51.015
Uh. Not particularly original
or inspired, but it worked.

19:51.612 --> 19:52.646
Who are you again?

19:52.935 --> 19:53.624
He's a fan.

19:54.307 --> 19:57.655
Uh-huh. There's some stairs on
the other side of the temple

19:57.698 --> 19:59.033
that lead out of
the ravine.

19:59.335 --> 20:01.741
I suggest you two take
them and head west.

20:01.913 --> 20:02.720
What about you?

20:03.033 --> 20:06.196
I've got to get this to a
museum. Thanks for your help.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.390
I couldn't have done it
without you. Both of you.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.667
So?

20:16.320 --> 20:19.920
So. Maybe the later books
ARE slightly more realistic

20:20.000 --> 20:22.406
than I gave them credit for.
I still don't like them.

20:22.670 --> 20:24.104
What? How can you--

20:24.160 --> 20:26.683
Wait! Hold on! Before
we get in another fight,

20:26.713 --> 20:28.744
I think I finally
figured it out!

20:28.990 --> 20:32.910
I love the Daring Do that solves
puzzles and uses her brain

20:32.929 --> 20:34.227
to get out of tough situations.

20:34.529 --> 20:36.818
And she did WAY more of that
in the original trilogy.

20:37.003 --> 20:40.233
YOU love the Daring Do
that is brave and awesome

20:40.252 --> 20:42.652
and comes out on top no
matter what the odds.

20:43.206 --> 20:44.584
OK.

20:44.867 --> 20:46.221
And that's OK!

20:46.553 --> 20:49.058
We might never agree on
what makes Daring Do cool.

20:49.255 --> 20:52.313
But YOU are definitely cool.

20:52.658 --> 20:56.301
I mean the way you saved
me on the bridge? Wow.

20:56.646 --> 21:01.741
And escaping from the temple!
You, Rainbow Dash, are AWESOME.

21:02.701 --> 21:06.516
Well. I'm not the one
who can locate a treasure

21:06.535 --> 21:08.849
in half the time Daring Do can.

21:09.089 --> 21:11.058
You may have terrible
taste in books,

21:11.083 --> 21:13.544
but you're pretty
awesome yourself.

21:14.160 --> 21:17.027
In a brainy egghead puzzle-
solving kind of way.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.283
I guess we don't have to agree
on everything to get along.

21:20.775 --> 21:21.470
Friends?

21:21.735 --> 21:23.243
DEFINITELY friends.

21:25.895 --> 21:27.790
Do you think AK
Yearling would consider

21:27.820 --> 21:29.286
letting ME write the next book?

21:29.403 --> 21:30.492
I mean, think I could

21:30.535 --> 21:31.981
make things way clearer.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.073
I mean for instance, in
the second adventure

21:34.110 --> 21:34.984
there's a side
character;

21:35.021 --> 21:36.935
I don't want to kind
of name it right now,

21:36.960 --> 21:38.738
because it's sort of
this thing that I've

21:38.756 --> 21:40.320
already written a lot
of fan fiction on.

21:40.356 --> 21:40.947
I don't want you know...

21:41.070 --> 21:42.270
Not that I'm saying that
you would steal it;

21:42.418 --> 21:45.015
but I am saying that this
would totally go along,

21:45.218 --> 21:47.163
my whole thing about
puzzle solving.

21:47.218 --> 21:49.323
Except what if each
puzzle that was solved

21:49.550 --> 21:51.255
unlocked a new karate move?

21:51.316 --> 21:52.670
Think of it that way, right?

21:52.898 --> 21:54.781
I'm kind of a Yearlite myself,

21:54.849 --> 21:56.461
so I'm sure she'd be open to--

21:56.486 --> 21:57.963
Uh, Quibble?

21:58.393 --> 21:58.892
Sorry!
