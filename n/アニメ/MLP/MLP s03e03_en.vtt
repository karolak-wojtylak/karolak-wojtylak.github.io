00:09.600 --> 00:11.770
Try again, Twi.
You can do it.

00:12.020 --> 00:14.250
Phew!
This spell's a toughie.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.120
But I feel lucky this time.

00:16.270 --> 00:17.896
One, two...

00:17.896 --> 00:18.860
One, two...
- Hi!

00:22.790 --> 00:24.730
Pinkie, why'd you do that?!

00:24.880 --> 00:26.190
'Cause hugs are funeriffic!

00:26.340 --> 00:28.200
Especially when you throw one
around a friend.

00:28.910 --> 00:30.450
Whatcha doin'?

00:30.600 --> 00:32.860
Trying to turn that apple
into an orange!

00:33.010 --> 00:35.130
But you kind of threw her aim off.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.800
Whee!
What a cute orange birdie!

00:37.950 --> 00:39.550
Do me next, Twilight!
Do me! Do me!

00:40.290 --> 00:43.050
Ooh! Rarity, wanna see Twilight
turn me into an orange?

00:43.200 --> 00:45.400
It's gonna be funna-fun-fun!

00:45.550 --> 00:48.670
As fun as creating an
haute-couture ensemble

00:48.820 --> 00:50.150
that I just finished making?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.310
Delightful, no?

00:52.460 --> 00:53.810
This is terrible!

00:53.960 --> 00:56.500
I admit it's perhaps not
my finest work, but I--

00:56.650 --> 01:00.200
You had total, awesome, amazing fun,
and I missed out on it?!

01:01.620 --> 01:02.500
Wait.

01:02.650 --> 01:04.500
What if there's more awesome,
amazing fun with friends

01:04.650 --> 01:05.920
happening somewhere
in Ponyville right now

01:06.070 --> 01:08.300
that I'm missing out on too?!

01:08.790 --> 01:11.900
We weren't gonna turn her
into an orange. I swear!

01:14.400 --> 01:16.000
Hey, Rainbow Dash.
Whatcha doin'?

01:16.140 --> 01:18.890
This punk cloud got so heavy,
it's making fog.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.800
Figure I'll thin this bad boy out
so it floats back up.

01:21.950 --> 01:23.240
Ooh! Fun!

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Gotta go!

01:26.450 --> 01:28.750
Thanks, Pinkie?

01:30.250 --> 01:31.400
Hey, Applejack.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.500
That looks like fun.
Can I join you?

01:33.650 --> 01:36.000
Whee!
Next time, I'll pull you.

01:39.550 --> 01:40.660
Fluttershy!

01:40.960 --> 01:41.960
There...

01:41.960 --> 01:43.100
There... you...

01:43.100 --> 01:43.820
There... you... are...

01:44.230 --> 01:45.370
doing...

01:45.370 --> 01:46.530
doing... anything...

01:46.540 --> 01:47.690
doing... anything... fun?

01:48.230 --> 01:49.780
Not especially.

01:49.930 --> 01:52.890
Oh, good.
Fun is hard!

01:58.450 --> 02:03.450

02:37.800 --> 02:39.690
Feeling better, Pinkie?

02:40.150 --> 02:42.120
Abso-tutely-lutely!

02:42.270 --> 02:43.800
Thanks for letting me rest in
your butterfly grove

02:43.950 --> 02:45.650
while I get
my Pinkie strength back.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.360
What are friends for?

02:48.510 --> 02:49.560
That's just the thing!

02:49.710 --> 02:53.300
I've got so many wonderful friends
having fun in every last corner of Ponyville

02:53.450 --> 02:55.560
I can't figure out how
to keep up with it all.

02:55.710 --> 02:59.680
It's driving me even more
coco-loco than usual!

02:59.830 --> 03:03.060
I can promise to not do anything
fun at all if that would help.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.580
You are such a good friend.

03:05.730 --> 03:06.890
There you are, Pinkie.

03:07.050 --> 03:08.360
Been looking everywhere for you, girl.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.030
Been looking everywhere for you, girl.
- Hey, Pinkie.

03:09.180 --> 03:11.900
Got something fun planned this afternoon.
Thought you might wanna know about it.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.060
Well, I'll be an apple crisp.

03:14.210 --> 03:15.700
I'm here for the same reason!

03:15.850 --> 03:17.500
This is perfect!

03:17.650 --> 03:20.000
Everyone will now
bring their fun to me.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.050
This will solve everything!
Why didn't I think of that?

03:23.200 --> 03:26.470
Actually, what I meant is
after I'm done whipping up today's weather,

03:26.620 --> 03:28.750
I'll be chilling by the lake
catching some rays.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.650
- Wanna hang?
- I am so there!

03:32.440 --> 03:35.670
And my family's having a barn raising
this afternoon at Sweet Apple Acres.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.300
And I'm also so there!

03:38.450 --> 03:39.410
Whee! Whee!

03:39.560 --> 03:42.300
But that's when I'll be
at the swimming hole.

03:42.450 --> 03:43.780
Oh, well.
Doesn't matter.

03:43.930 --> 03:45.450
Whichever one you choose
is okay with me.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.400
Me too.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.400
Choose?

03:51.030 --> 03:53.200
One... two...

03:58.500 --> 03:59.370
Pinkie!

04:02.710 --> 04:06.220
What in the wide-wide world
of Equestria are you doing now?

04:06.370 --> 04:07.800
Timing myself
galloping back and forth

04:07.950 --> 04:09.550
between the swimming hole
and Sweet Apple Acres.

04:09.700 --> 04:12.390
I'm trying to cut down my time
so Rainbow Dash dives off the swing,

04:12.540 --> 04:14.850
I can get to Sweet Apple Acres
to help with the barn raising,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.950
and then be back in time
to see Rainbow Dash hit the water

04:17.100 --> 04:18.800
after doing a double flip.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.940
If I can cut my time by only 20 minutes,
I'm good.

04:22.660 --> 04:23.590
Oh, Pinkie.

04:23.740 --> 04:25.940
I'm afraid no matter
how hard you try,

04:26.090 --> 04:27.560
the only way to
pull something like that off

04:27.710 --> 04:29.450
is if there's more of you
to go around.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.480
That's it, Twilight!

04:34.650 --> 04:37.040
The legend of the Mirror Pool!

04:37.190 --> 04:39.160
The legend of the who-what now?

04:39.450 --> 04:40.540
Pinkie!

04:40.690 --> 04:43.440
I'm familiar with loads of legends,
and I never heard of--

04:43.440 --> 04:44.980
Does this mean practice is over?

04:45.130 --> 04:47.860
Of course not.
Back to work.

04:51.150 --> 04:53.800
Seems like hardly
anypony's been here in ages.

04:54.100 --> 04:57.770
I hope I'm remembering the rhymes right
from my nana Pinkie story.

04:58.550 --> 05:00.860
Where the brambles are thickest,

05:01.040 --> 05:02.710
there you will find... huh...

05:02.860 --> 05:05.190
a pond beyond
the most twisted of vines.

05:05.340 --> 05:06.990
Who's there?!
I heard a voice!

05:07.210 --> 05:09.610
Oh.
It was me.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.280
Ouch! Oh!
Stop scratching me up, brambles!

05:21.480 --> 05:23.620
The Mirror Pool!

05:24.140 --> 05:25.740
Oh, and there's that voice again.

05:26.690 --> 05:27.706
Ah, Pinkie.

05:27.857 --> 05:30.435
You have got to stop
talking to yourself.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.840
Starting... now.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.760
And into her own reflection she stared,

05:36.910 --> 05:40.210
huh... yearning for one
whose reflection she shared

05:40.360 --> 05:43.850
and solemnly sweared not to be scared

05:44.000 --> 05:46.260
at the prospect of being doubly mared!

05:46.940 --> 05:48.680
Whee-hee!

05:48.840 --> 05:51.490
Wow. The legend is true.
It really worked!

05:51.640 --> 05:53.900
Okay, wait, I promised
not to talk to myself anymore.

05:54.050 --> 05:55.380
I should say something to her.

05:55.540 --> 05:58.070
Or... would that still be
talking to myself?

05:58.220 --> 06:00.650
Excuse me, me?
Can I have word with you?

06:00.800 --> 06:02.200
Uh, I mean, me?

06:02.350 --> 06:04.630
Listen, I can see you're having lots of fun,
but--

06:04.780 --> 06:06.050
Fun!
Did somebody say 'fun'?

06:06.200 --> 06:06.990
Where?

06:06.990 --> 06:08.250
Where?
- I did, over here.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.650
I thought someone said
something about fun.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.300
Where is it? Over here?
Over here?

06:11.450 --> 06:12.880
I don't see it.
Where is it? Where is it?

06:13.030 --> 06:14.100
Oh, calm yourself.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.770
There's loads of fun to be had
in Ponyville with my girls.

06:17.450 --> 06:21.500
Trot on over back to Ponyville with me,
and I'll tell ya all about them.

06:22.540 --> 06:23.990
And then there's Rarity.

06:24.140 --> 06:26.600
She's the one with all
the fancy clothes and ribbons and stuff.

06:26.750 --> 06:30.180
I'm thinking she can make us all
matching t-shirts that say 'team Pinkie' and--

06:30.330 --> 06:32.170
Is this Ponyville?
Where's the fun? Where's the fun?

06:32.320 --> 06:35.400
Uh, well, let's see.
Applejack's having a barn raising at--

06:35.650 --> 06:36.850
It's thataway!

06:37.000 --> 06:38.250
Wait!
Come back!

06:38.400 --> 06:41.400
Don't forget to meet me back here
to tell me everything about everything.

06:41.550 --> 06:42.950
Like I was there myself.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.140
Because I'm you and...
and you're me, and--

06:45.300 --> 06:48.700
Oh my gosh!
This is the greatest plan ever!!

06:49.040 --> 06:51.000
Now, off to double my fun!

06:59.220 --> 07:01.840
Let's rock this pool, ponies!

07:06.100 --> 07:08.700
Coming in, Dashy?
The water's great.

07:08.850 --> 07:10.400
It's totally wet and everything.

07:10.550 --> 07:12.480
I don't know.

07:12.630 --> 07:15.400
Cloud busting was tougher work
than usual, today.

07:15.550 --> 07:18.020
I'm kind of exhausted.

07:19.410 --> 07:21.080
That's fine.
You relax.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.020
At least we'll still be together.

07:23.170 --> 07:24.400
Glad you made it, Pinkie.

07:24.550 --> 07:26.650
I thought you maybe went
to Applejack's, instead.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.170
- I did.
-Oh. The Barn up yet?

07:29.320 --> 07:31.070
I have no idea.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.760
But I thought you said
you were just at Applejack's.

07:34.910 --> 07:37.550
Actually, I'm probably still
on my way there now!

07:37.700 --> 07:39.220
Whee!

07:45.490 --> 07:46.590
Oh, Pinkie Pie.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.890
I'm so glad you wandered by.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.260
I know I promised
not to have any fun today, but

07:51.410 --> 07:53.600
I couldn't help myself.

07:54.210 --> 07:58.780
All of my critter friends wanted a picnic,
and I couldn't disappoint them.

07:58.780 --> 07:59.800
Come join us.

07:59.950 --> 08:02.860
We have plenty of hay juice
and marmalade to go around.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.650
Don't we, critters?

08:11.780 --> 08:13.700
Wait!
That sounds super fun!

08:13.850 --> 08:16.330
But Applejohn sounds super fun too!

08:16.480 --> 08:19.760
And-- and-- I can't do one
without missing out on the other!

08:19.900 --> 08:21.400
Who's Applejohn?

08:21.550 --> 08:23.470
Two fun things at once!
But which-- which--

08:23.620 --> 08:24.560
Can't decide!

08:24.990 --> 08:26.140
Trouble breathing!

08:27.150 --> 08:28.410
Walls closing in!

08:28.560 --> 08:31.120
Walls?
But we're outside.

08:34.220 --> 08:37.230
Goodness.
Was it something I said?

08:37.800 --> 08:38.800
Yes!

08:42.520 --> 08:47.180
So, you see, that's how I'm able
to have fun in two places at once.

08:47.950 --> 08:49.910
Duplicates of you, huh?

08:50.380 --> 08:52.410
Yeah, sure, Pinkie.

08:52.550 --> 08:56.660
Look, I was just gearing up
to catch some Z's. So uh...

08:56.810 --> 09:00.020
Gotcha!
I'll have the rest of my fun very quietly.

09:07.820 --> 09:09.380
How'd you do that?

09:09.530 --> 09:12.510
Just trying to show a little consideration
for my sleepy friend.

09:15.170 --> 09:16.380
Ooh! Ooh!
Gotta run!

09:16.530 --> 09:18.450
Looks like I'm trying to
get my attention.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.980
- Excuse me.
- And me.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.500
Ooh! Ooh!
Tell me all about it.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.240
Did they pull the walls of the barn up
slooow... or fast?

09:30.390 --> 09:32.740
Maybe slow to medium-fast?
Somewhere in that range?

09:33.440 --> 09:34.630
Ooh!
Did you get ice cream?

09:34.780 --> 09:36.200
What kinds did they have?
Banana brickle?

09:36.350 --> 09:37.470
I didn't make it!

09:37.620 --> 09:39.050
I was on my way there,
and then Fluttershutter--

09:39.200 --> 09:39.550
Fluttershy.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.930
Yeah! Her! She offered
something else fun for me to do.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.210
A picnic!
With cute little animals.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.220
How could you say no to that?

09:46.370 --> 09:47.950
That's what I'm saying!

09:48.109 --> 09:51.100
Then I would have missed the super fun thing
with Applesauce!

09:51.250 --> 09:52.010
Applejack.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.270
So I didn't do
anything fun at all!

09:56.560 --> 10:00.030
Oh, my poor, poor me.
There, there.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.600
Tell me what.
We just need a couple more Pinkie Pies.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.940
- Easy-peasy.
- Really?

10:05.100 --> 10:07.390
Come on.
Would I lie to me?

10:08.860 --> 10:11.380
And solemnly sweared
not to be scared

10:11.540 --> 10:13.900
at the prospect of being
doubly mared.

10:14.590 --> 10:16.210
Look!
A double me!

10:16.360 --> 10:18.500
I think you mean
a double-double me?

10:18.650 --> 10:21.120
Plus another double-double me,
which makes two double-double me's,

10:21.270 --> 10:22.790
or a double-double-double me,
if you will.

10:24.180 --> 10:26.960
Did somebody say 'fun'?
Where? Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!

10:30.670 --> 10:32.990
Now Applejack, Rainbow Dash
and Fluttershy are covered

10:33.140 --> 10:37.140
plus one extra Pinkie Pie in case
we get an extra invite from somepony else.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.090
Perfect!

10:38.240 --> 10:39.990
Okay, let's go!

10:40.140 --> 10:41.730
And solemnly sweared

10:41.880 --> 10:44.980
not to be scared,
at the prospect of being doubly mared!

10:48.070 --> 10:50.700
Okay, good enough.
Pinkie Pies, moving out--

10:50.850 --> 10:53.450
...not to be scared,
at the prospect of being doubly mared!

10:53.600 --> 10:55.820
What in the name of pink?!

10:55.970 --> 10:56.990
Knock it off!

11:00.170 --> 11:02.750
To Ponyville, everyone!
Follow me!

11:06.520 --> 11:08.530
Yes, it's fun there.

11:18.150 --> 11:19.550
Okay, between the bunch of us,

11:19.700 --> 11:22.560
we should have every nook and cranny of fun
in Ponyville covered, at all times.

11:22.710 --> 11:25.200
An unprecedented
and massive undertaking!

11:25.200 --> 11:28.020
But first,
a pop quiz on the names I taught you!

11:28.580 --> 11:29.590
Applejack!

11:30.590 --> 11:31.820
Fluttershy!

11:32.520 --> 11:33.550
Pinkie Pie!

11:33.700 --> 11:34.570
Excellent!

11:34.720 --> 11:36.450
Okay,
let's get on with this, folks.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.700
Fan out on three.
One--

11:41.510 --> 11:42.670
Eh, good enough.

11:55.260 --> 11:56.520
What the--

11:56.670 --> 12:00.690
Wow! Pinkie Pie wasn't kidding
about the duplicates!

12:00.840 --> 12:05.440
Except now there's triplicates...
and quadruplicates!

12:06.410 --> 12:08.280
Dash is gonna love this!

12:08.430 --> 12:12.030
If I push her around on this floaty thing,
it'll be fun, and relaxing!

12:15.360 --> 12:17.280
Uh oh...

12:17.430 --> 12:19.510
No more Pinkies!
I can't take it!

12:20.920 --> 12:22.210
Gosh, uh...

12:22.360 --> 12:25.750
I wonder what fun they're having raising
the barn at Applejack's right now!

12:25.900 --> 12:27.140
Maybe I'd better go check!

12:49.220 --> 12:52.070
Oh, phew!
Looks like I haven't missed a thing!

12:52.650 --> 12:55.630
I wanna know right now
where all you Pinkies came from

12:55.780 --> 12:59.550
so I can find out who's responsible for
y'all ruinin' our barn raisin'!

13:00.990 --> 13:03.350
Uh, you look pretty busy right now,
so...

13:03.500 --> 13:05.250
maybe we should talk a little later?

13:08.760 --> 13:12.710
Y'all come back here and clean up
after yourselves this instant!

13:16.180 --> 13:19.100
Oh no, what have I done,
what have I done?!

13:19.250 --> 13:20.980
My poor friends...

13:24.440 --> 13:27.980
Okay, everypony,
please, calm down!

13:28.150 --> 13:29.540
Calm down?!

13:29.690 --> 13:32.910
I have just had a Pinkie hurricane
raging through my shop!

13:33.050 --> 13:35.240
And they trashed our critter picnic!

13:36.910 --> 13:40.300
Please, everypony, hang on
while I try to figure something out!

13:40.450 --> 13:42.040
Come on, Spike.

13:43.370 --> 13:46.210
I've gotta try to remember
the name of that legend she mentioned.

13:57.430 --> 14:00.840
Ah, here it is!
"The legend of the Mirror Pond".

14:00.990 --> 14:04.060
It describes a spell I can use to send
them back where they came from!

14:04.210 --> 14:05.750
That's perfect, let's go!

14:05.900 --> 14:07.100
But there's a catch.

14:07.250 --> 14:11.500
If I can't figure out which one's the real Pinkie,
I might send her back by mistake!

14:12.280 --> 14:14.720
Well, we'll just have to figure out
who the real one is then.

14:14.870 --> 14:16.830
Shouldn't be too hard.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.790
Does anypony here know how we can tell
the real Pinkie from all the rest of them?

14:24.060 --> 14:25.960
Twilight! I have to talk to you,
I need your help!

14:26.100 --> 14:27.940
Excuse me, whoever you are,

14:28.100 --> 14:31.000
but I'm not talking to any of you Pinkies
unless you're the real Pinkie.

14:31.150 --> 14:33.000
Oh, but, I am the real Pinkie!

14:33.150 --> 14:34.840
No you're not,
I'm the real Pinkie!

14:34.990 --> 14:36.150
I'm the real Pinkie!

14:36.150 --> 14:37.180
I'm the real Pinkie!
- No, I'm the real Pinkie!

14:37.330 --> 14:38.530
I'm the real Pinkie!

14:38.530 --> 14:39.900
I'm the real Pinkie!
- No, I'm the real Pinkie!

14:40.050 --> 14:41.390
I'm the real Pinkie!

14:43.900 --> 14:47.800
How in tarnation are we supposed
to tell which is the real Pinkie?

14:47.950 --> 14:49.230
I have no idea.

14:49.380 --> 14:50.450
Me either.

14:51.220 --> 14:53.200
We've all got the same adorable tails,

14:53.350 --> 14:55.360
we've all got the same adorable manes,

14:55.510 --> 14:57.950
we've all got the same adorable hooves!

14:58.100 --> 15:01.220
Which one of us is the real Pinkie?!

15:02.060 --> 15:03.810
I haven't the slightest clue!

15:03.960 --> 15:06.740
And if I can't tell us apart...
who can?

15:19.310 --> 15:21.180
Ugh, this is hopeless!

15:21.330 --> 15:22.850
Maybe that one's the real Pinkie.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.140
Please. The real Pinkie Pie never sat
that long in one place for her whole life!

15:27.290 --> 15:28.150
I'm gonna go ask.

15:28.300 --> 15:31.060
Of course she's gonna say
she's the real Pinkie! They all do!

15:31.210 --> 15:32.590
You're wasting your time.

15:32.740 --> 15:35.700
So, lemme guess.
You're the real Pinkie Pie.

15:35.850 --> 15:37.000
Heck if I know!

15:37.140 --> 15:39.150
Could be any one of us,
if you ask me.

15:41.150 --> 15:44.690
And if I said I was the real Pinkie,
you wouldn't even believe me anyway.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.150
So just leave me alone.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.240
I've got some important poking around
with my hoof to do.

15:49.390 --> 15:51.290
Oh Spike, how're we gonna do this?

15:51.440 --> 15:54.560
I can't risk sending the real Pinkie
back into the pond!

15:54.710 --> 15:57.120
I miss the real Pinkie.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.740
I bet she misses you too.

15:59.890 --> 16:03.230
Bet she'd do just about anything
to get to be with her friends again.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.000
Hey, hey!

16:08.140 --> 16:09.590
What if you gave them a test?

16:09.740 --> 16:13.150
Pick something really hard for a Pinkie to do,
something not fun at all!

16:13.300 --> 16:15.560
Any Pinkie that can't do it
goes back into the pond.

16:15.710 --> 16:19.550
But whoever wants to stay the most,
that must be the real Pinkie!

16:20.310 --> 16:23.170
You know, that's not a bad idea.

16:24.160 --> 16:27.990
This is great! If I pass,
I get to be with my friends again!

16:28.300 --> 16:30.300
But what if I don't pass?

16:30.450 --> 16:32.910
What if I'm not the real Pinkie Pie?!

16:34.100 --> 16:37.010
Stupid magic mirror water!

16:37.160 --> 16:38.850
This is all your fault!

16:39.220 --> 16:41.000
And mine.

16:45.610 --> 16:46.810
Hey, Twilight!

16:47.850 --> 16:51.480
I've been looking all over for you ponies.
What are you all doing here?

16:51.630 --> 16:53.520
Fluttershy spoke
with the woodland critters,

16:53.670 --> 16:56.990
and they've agreed to take us into their
home 'til the Pinkie storm dies down.

16:57.140 --> 17:00.260
You guys, we're gonna fix this.
And I know exactly how.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.300
Are we gonna lose our real Pinkie Pie?

17:03.450 --> 17:04.480
I don't think so.

17:04.630 --> 17:05.810
Now come along.

17:05.960 --> 17:09.100
I've already got Applejack and her family
rounding up all the Pinkies.

17:12.610 --> 17:14.620
Hyah, Pinkies, hyah!

17:14.770 --> 17:17.950
Ooh, they wanna play chase!
This is fun, too!

17:27.980 --> 17:29.510
Oh, give it a rest.

17:30.810 --> 17:32.780
Welcome, Pinkies, welcome.

17:32.930 --> 17:35.520
Please have a seat and
make yourselves comfortable.

17:37.060 --> 17:40.700
Okay, I suppose you can't be
comfortable staying in one place,

17:40.850 --> 17:42.370
but have a seat anyway.

17:45.980 --> 17:47.490
Sit down!

17:49.740 --> 17:51.900
Better. Now, I suppose
you're all wondering

17:52.050 --> 17:53.780
why I've gathered you
all here today.

17:54.460 --> 17:55.260
For fun?

17:55.410 --> 17:57.600
No, just the opposite, actually.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.900
Wait up,
I got one more!

18:00.050 --> 18:04.050
I found this one poking at the ground
with her hoof and drawing frowny faces.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.760
Have her come sit with the others.

18:07.450 --> 18:10.140
Pinkies, you've been brought here
to take a test.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.560
Don't worry, it's a simple test.
About as simple as they come.

18:15.710 --> 18:17.700
And whoever passes gets to stay.

18:19.820 --> 18:21.150
Curtain, please.

18:22.060 --> 18:26.040
The test will be watching paint dry!

18:27.750 --> 18:30.870
On your mark, get set, go!

18:33.210 --> 18:35.530
Whoa, this is so exciting!

18:37.810 --> 18:40.830
Okay, maybe not that exciting.

18:50.110 --> 18:52.050
Oh, hey, look at the birdie!

19:05.810 --> 19:07.750
Watch me bounce
and touch the ceiling!

19:11.700 --> 19:14.000
Is that... is that a frog
crossed with an orange?

19:14.150 --> 19:15.750
- Cool!
- Where?

19:17.580 --> 19:20.300
Look what I can do
with my hooves!

19:26.380 --> 19:29.663
Betcha can't make a face
crazier than...

19:29.814 --> 19:30.764
this!

19:56.200 --> 19:58.450
I can't take it any more!

19:58.600 --> 20:01.900
Somepony's making balloon animals!

20:02.050 --> 20:03.470
What? Where?

20:08.450 --> 20:10.710
Pinkie,
you can look away now.

20:11.230 --> 20:13.610
- I passed?
- You passed.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.110
You're the only Pinkie
who kept staring at the wall.

20:16.260 --> 20:18.160
I had to, I just had to.

20:18.310 --> 20:20.730
I couldn't leave my friends,
I just couldn't.

20:21.860 --> 20:25.290
But I guess sometimes
I will have to choose between them.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.320
I knew you'd be up to the challenge.

20:27.470 --> 20:31.620
I'm me! I'm me!
I'm meeee!!

20:31.770 --> 20:33.550
Or am I?

20:33.700 --> 20:36.570
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I am.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.500
Dear Princess Celestia,

20:39.650 --> 20:41.080
it's great to have fun,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.850
but it's even greater
to have great friends.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.250
And having lots of friends means that
you sometimes have to make choices

20:47.400 --> 20:48.950
as to who you spend your time with.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.290
But that's okay,
because good friends

20:51.440 --> 20:54.000
will always give you
lots of opportunities to have fun.

20:54.150 --> 20:57.780
So even if you're missing out,
it's never for long.

20:57.940 --> 21:00.350
Respectfully yours,
Pinkie Pie.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.400
Hi Pinkie Pie,

21:04.550 --> 21:06.570
we were thinking
we should go out and celebrate.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.660
You up for some wheelbarrow races?

21:08.810 --> 21:11.190
Or I could take everypony
on a cloud ride!

21:11.340 --> 21:15.330
I could throw a party with punch
and zesty cucumber sandwiches! Ooh!

21:15.480 --> 21:19.010
You wanna know exactly
what I feel like doing right now?

21:24.890 --> 21:26.400
That looks like fun.
