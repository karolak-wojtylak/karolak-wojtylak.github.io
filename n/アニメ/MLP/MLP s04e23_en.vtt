00:08.109 --> 00:10.109
Hear ye! Hear ye!

00:10.111 --> 00:15.114
The Ponyville Foal and Filly
Fair is almost ready to begin!

00:18.420 --> 00:21.220
Whee! Ha ha!

00:22.509 --> 00:23.180
Ha ha!

00:23.194 --> 00:23.978
Hee hee hee!

00:26.478 --> 00:28.314
Just because the
attendees are young,

00:28.478 --> 00:31.412
doesn't mean they don't deserve
my very best creative work.

00:31.791 --> 00:33.906
Why, this puppet theatre
is going to be the talk

00:33.978 --> 00:35.724
of the Foal and Filly Fair.

00:36.952 --> 00:38.138
How could it not be?

00:38.327 --> 00:40.216
You're the one making it.

00:40.569 --> 00:43.110
Oh, but I couldn't have
done it without the help

00:43.149 --> 00:45.822
of one of my dearest and
most supportive friends.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.911
You are my favorite dragon.

00:49.457 --> 00:51.225
Your favorite dragon?

00:51.619 --> 00:52.700
Aw, gee.

00:53.094 --> 00:56.813
The hours have been long, the
work taxing beyond compare,

00:57.172 --> 00:58.940
but it will all be
worth it when we hear

00:58.958 --> 01:00.604
those three little words--

01:01.235 --> 01:03.080
<i>This is awful!</i>

01:03.453 --> 01:04.050
Awful?

01:04.498 --> 01:07.166
Completely unusable.

01:07.681 --> 01:09.239
Hmmm.

01:10.411 --> 01:12.306
It doesn't travel!

01:13.213 --> 01:15.414
There's no room for my puppets!

01:16.655 --> 01:19.613
It appears I won't have a
travelling puppet theatre

01:19.629 --> 01:21.644
to use after all.

01:25.758 --> 01:27.736
I don't know what that
guy was talking about.

01:28.195 --> 01:30.476
This thing is perfect.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.766
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu</i>

02:12.817 --> 02:15.953
<i>This is terrible.</i>
<i>Simply terrible!</i>

02:18.240 --> 02:21.084
So that puppeteer didn't like
your exquisitely crafted,

02:21.123 --> 02:23.065
best puppet theatre in the
history of puppet theatres

02:23.075 --> 02:23.884
puppet theatre.

02:25.662 --> 02:27.065
You can just contribute
something else

02:27.116 --> 02:28.429
to the Foal and Filly Fair.

02:30.161 --> 02:31.520
I suppose I could.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.247
Forget it, Spike.

02:34.517 --> 02:36.640
I'd never have something
finished in time.

02:44.183 --> 02:46.608
I wanted to leave my
creative mark on the fair

02:46.776 --> 02:47.742
and I have failed.

02:48.544 --> 02:49.549
Mmm.

02:49.960 --> 02:50.805
Miserably.

02:52.796 --> 02:55.824
And that makes me miserable.

03:06.284 --> 03:08.745
There's gotta be something
in here somewhere.

03:08.985 --> 03:09.738
Hoo!

03:10.044 --> 03:12.085
It's not who, it's what.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.402
Like what can help Rarity make
something in time for the fair?

03:15.978 --> 03:19.377
She really, really, really wants
to make a creative contribution.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.434
She said I'm her
favourite dragon.

03:21.707 --> 03:23.959
So it's up to me to come through
for her in her time of need.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.779
There's gotta be some kind of
spell that'll do the trick.

03:29.951 --> 03:30.597
<i>Hoo!</i>

03:31.320 --> 03:33.071
Come on, help a dragon out!

03:34.384 --> 03:35.149
Hoo!

03:37.311 --> 03:37.920
Hoo!

03:41.043 --> 03:41.732
Hoo!

03:42.115 --> 03:42.768
Agh!

03:42.934 --> 03:44.236
It's not for me!

03:44.290 --> 03:45.143
It's for Rarity.

03:45.627 --> 03:47.697
The one who made you that
bow tie you liked so much.

03:48.000 --> 03:48.932
Hoo hoo!

03:49.170 --> 03:51.020
OK. I get it.

03:53.272 --> 03:54.663
You don't think we
should use magi--

04:01.545 --> 04:03.441
What is that?

04:03.962 --> 04:05.568
Hoo! Hoo!

04:12.298 --> 04:14.062
Hoo! Hoo!

04:28.245 --> 04:30.230
Hoo! Hoo!

04:30.825 --> 04:31.332
What?

04:31.687 --> 04:34.259
If I wasn't supposed to have it,
it wouldn't be so easy to get.

04:34.704 --> 04:37.010
And it's covered
in spikes, like me!

04:37.619 --> 04:38.720
Hoooo!

04:41.342 --> 04:42.710
Hooo!

04:45.416 --> 04:49.843
"Inspiration Manifestation,
instantly brings ideas to life."

04:50.901 --> 04:52.780
I'm liking the
looks of this one!

04:53.336 --> 04:54.179
Hmm.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.211
Rarity!

05:09.527 --> 05:11.026
Leave me be!

05:11.545 --> 05:13.274
Can't you see how
distraught, disappointed

05:13.319 --> 05:15.978
and downtrodden I still am?

05:16.858 --> 05:18.936
But I brought you something.

05:19.666 --> 05:22.282
Unless it's another carton
of Vanilla Oat Swirl

05:22.563 --> 05:24.897
or word that the festival
has been cancelled,

05:25.188 --> 05:27.555
I don't think I'm interested.

05:27.914 --> 05:29.715
It's magic.

05:30.210 --> 05:33.867
Spike, Precious Scales,
I already have magic.

05:36.025 --> 05:38.247
But not the kind that can
help you create something

05:38.253 --> 05:39.865
in time for the fair.

05:40.481 --> 05:41.555
This can!

05:43.397 --> 05:45.043
I suppose it's worth a try.

05:45.843 --> 05:48.427
From in the head to
out in the world.

05:48.801 --> 05:50.454
Every thought to action.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.886
Hold close this book,
and through its spell,

05:53.890 --> 05:55.927
you'll start a chain reaction.

05:56.534 --> 05:59.432
Projecting forth
whatever beauty you see.

05:59.857 --> 06:04.593
Only when true words are spoken,
will you finally be set free.

06:05.586 --> 06:06.339
Did it work?

06:07.564 --> 06:08.940
There's only one
way to find out.

06:15.377 --> 06:16.167
Oh my!

06:16.478 --> 06:19.110
I thought about making this a
much more beautiful spell book

06:19.475 --> 06:20.741
and I have!

06:25.836 --> 06:28.928
Dear, dear, Spike, here
I was about to give up,

06:29.326 --> 06:33.145
but like a true friend, you've
come through with flying colors.

06:34.868 --> 06:37.430
Come! We must find the
puppeteer right away

06:37.629 --> 06:39.923
so that I may provide him with
the most fabulous theatre

06:39.935 --> 06:41.447
he's ever imagined.

06:41.859 --> 06:47.038
Or should I say that
I've ever imagined.

06:57.219 --> 07:00.290
Ah, Miss Rarity, come to
see the show, I presume.

07:02.778 --> 07:04.938
You'll notice I had to make
do in light of your recent

07:05.063 --> 07:07.959
failure to produce a
functioning theatre.

07:13.713 --> 07:16.364
Oh, but I think you'll find
the new one I've created

07:16.456 --> 07:18.671
will be much more
to your liking.

07:24.749 --> 07:27.639
Hmm yeah well, it is gorgeous,

07:27.773 --> 07:29.836
but that was never the
problem now, was it?

07:31.280 --> 07:35.473
Oh, well this one
does seem to travel.

07:38.282 --> 07:41.040
Plenty of room for my puppets.

07:41.412 --> 07:43.863
I say, Miss Rarity, I don't
know how you managed to do so

07:43.873 --> 07:45.744
in such a short amount of time,

07:45.992 --> 07:48.776
but you seem to have
redeemed yourself.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.809
How did you manage to do
so in such a short time?

07:54.048 --> 07:55.695
As a matter of fact,
she used a sp-

07:55.709 --> 07:57.476
A good designer never
reveals her tricks.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.498
Thank you again, Spike, for
being such a dear friend

08:07.834 --> 08:09.631
and finding this book for me.

08:09.980 --> 08:11.453
My pleasure.

08:11.795 --> 08:14.119
Well, guess I can return it
now that the fair is over.

08:14.431 --> 08:15.223
Yes, of course.

08:15.484 --> 08:18.027
I've made my creative
contribution as I'd hoped to do,

08:18.292 --> 08:19.221
and all is well.

08:25.014 --> 08:28.409
Then again, perhaps I should
keep it just a skotch longer.

08:28.686 --> 08:29.966
You don't mind do you, Spike?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.282
Of course not!

08:33.223 --> 08:34.390
See you tomorrow.

08:37.853 --> 08:38.677
What?

08:38.967 --> 08:40.360
She'll keep it for
a few more hours.

08:40.583 --> 08:41.580
No harm in that.

08:51.594 --> 08:52.339
Rarity?

08:55.880 --> 08:56.556
Wha!

08:58.216 --> 09:00.101
Spike! I'm so glad
you're here!

09:05.061 --> 09:06.222
Whoa!

09:10.074 --> 09:11.566
Are you OK?

09:12.183 --> 09:13.438
Oh! I've never been better.

09:13.724 --> 09:15.744
This book you've
given me is amazing!

09:15.970 --> 09:18.737
Why, I've been up all night
just creating and creating

09:18.741 --> 09:20.089
and creating and creating!

09:20.433 --> 09:24.066
I've completed my fall line
for the next fifteen seasons!

09:24.474 --> 09:25.184
Wow!

09:25.644 --> 09:28.039
But then I started
thinking, why stop there?

09:28.407 --> 09:30.835
Oh, Spike, I've always
thought this town of ours

09:30.881 --> 09:32.616
could use a few
beautifying upgrades.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.676
And with this book, I can make
that happen with such ease.

09:36.671 --> 09:38.675
You will support me in this
endeavor by letting me

09:38.731 --> 09:40.569
keep the book just
a little longer?

09:41.912 --> 09:43.305
Of course I will!

09:45.063 --> 09:46.444
Hoo!

09:52.364 --> 09:55.194
What do you say we get a little
breakfast before we get started?

09:55.346 --> 09:56.439
No time for breakfast.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.363
I want to get
started right away.

09:58.610 --> 10:00.766
Technically, we do have time

10:00.794 --> 10:02.103
because with that
book held close

10:02.111 --> 10:03.260
you can just
make things--

10:05.545 --> 10:06.132
Rarity?

10:09.477 --> 10:12.844
Now this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

10:13.192 --> 10:15.592
Why that cart hasn't an
ounce of stylish flair.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.400
My eyes playin'
tricks on me again?

10:27.843 --> 10:29.730
What in rhubarb
pie just happened?

10:32.298 --> 10:33.611
Isn't it gorgeous?

10:34.074 --> 10:35.106
It's amazing!

10:35.309 --> 10:36.852
You should ask Applejack
if she wants you

10:36.864 --> 10:39.059
to give all the Apple
family carts a makeover!

10:39.346 --> 10:42.427
Oh, I don't really think I need
to ask permission, darling.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.638
Everyone loves surprises.

10:45.014 --> 10:46.985
Especially when they're
gorgeous ones.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.101
You're right!

10:48.413 --> 10:50.132
Everypony does love surprises!

10:50.530 --> 10:53.847
We shouldn't even tell
anypony that it's me

10:53.857 --> 10:56.136
who is behind all the fabulous
changes I'll be making.

10:57.473 --> 10:59.057
Won't that be a
fun little secret

10:59.100 --> 11:00.561
for the three of
us to share?

11:01.717 --> 11:03.990
The... three of us?

11:05.322 --> 11:07.982
You, me, and the
book, of course.

11:10.202 --> 11:13.071
My marvellous,
marvellous book.

11:14.839 --> 11:15.955
Of course.

11:16.398 --> 11:18.989
Promise me you won't
say a word to anypony?

11:20.425 --> 11:21.455
You got it!

11:21.810 --> 11:23.906
I knew I could
count on you, Spike.

11:24.452 --> 11:26.485
And I also know just
what I want to do next.

11:29.041 --> 11:29.929
Take that!

11:30.183 --> 11:31.235
And that!

11:33.018 --> 11:33.367
Ha ha.

11:34.866 --> 11:35.486
What in the--

11:35.668 --> 11:39.258
Get. It. Off. Of. Me!

11:40.507 --> 11:42.405
I've always thought
Rainbow Dash

11:42.472 --> 11:43.941
could use a little more glamour.

11:44.232 --> 11:45.319
And now look at her!

11:45.490 --> 11:47.332
Cloud-busting with style!

11:48.774 --> 11:49.841
Moving on!

11:51.490 --> 11:52.425
She'll be fine.

11:52.575 --> 11:53.631
It's just a dress.

11:54.421 --> 11:56.202
Wait for your favorite dragon!

12:04.957 --> 12:08.093
<i>♪ La la la la la la </i>

12:08.175 --> 12:09.867
There you go, Mr. Robin.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.492
Don't you look so content
in your little house.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.756
Oh my goodness!

12:19.773 --> 12:20.653
You're lost?

12:22.175 --> 12:23.180
No. Not that way.

12:23.340 --> 12:25.640
That looks like that's
a door to a bedroom.

12:26.275 --> 12:27.176
Try that one over there.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.211
No. No.

12:29.406 --> 12:30.374
That leads to a...

12:31.559 --> 12:32.520
shoe closet?

12:32.729 --> 12:33.551
Oh dear.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.253
Maybe try the staircase?

12:35.334 --> 12:37.617
No. No. No. The
other staircase.

12:38.156 --> 12:39.463
Isn't it gorgeous?

12:39.836 --> 12:42.844
It's probably the most beautiful
bird house ever created...

12:43.047 --> 12:43.625
Go on.

12:43.982 --> 12:46.606
I'm just not sure how
the bird feels about it.

12:46.987 --> 12:50.979
Pfft. What does a bird know
about architectural design?

12:51.539 --> 12:54.819
What matters is what you
think, Spike, and you love it.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.792
Don't you?

12:57.383 --> 12:58.271
Of course I do!

12:58.550 --> 13:01.750
It's so... "Rarity".

13:02.282 --> 13:03.566
It is, isn't it.

13:04.710 --> 13:05.361
Oooh!

13:20.329 --> 13:22.310
Oh, adorable!

13:22.830 --> 13:25.438
But it could use a touch
of class, don't you think?

13:26.007 --> 13:27.957
Oh. Yeah. Definitely!

13:41.326 --> 13:43.410
This party doesn't even
seem to have a proper theme.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.243
Let's do something
about that, shall we?

13:46.820 --> 13:49.024
You've already made things
look really, really great.

13:49.582 --> 13:51.580
Maybe you should stop
while you're ahead?

13:51.984 --> 13:53.123
You're right, Spike.

13:53.531 --> 13:55.477
There's so much
to do elsewhere.

13:55.822 --> 13:56.448
Right.

13:57.190 --> 13:57.916
Elsewhere.

13:58.519 --> 14:00.575
Just one more little
thing before we go.

14:04.655 --> 14:08.241
Why, this party is certain
to make the society page now.

14:08.934 --> 14:11.613
Won't Pinkie Pie be pleased?

14:12.357 --> 14:14.907
Happy happy day to--huh?

14:19.381 --> 14:21.348
I am simply buzzing with ideas.

14:21.644 --> 14:22.647
Simply buzzing!

14:24.677 --> 14:25.588
That's great!

14:25.931 --> 14:28.581
But, uh, you've been at
this for a while now.

14:28.743 --> 14:29.904
How about you take a break?

14:30.070 --> 14:32.170
Give that brilliant
mind of yours a rest.

14:32.296 --> 14:33.112
<i>Don't be silly.</i>

14:33.674 --> 14:35.225
I'm not going to stop now.

14:35.601 --> 14:38.323
Why, I won't stop until
every inch of Ponyville

14:38.335 --> 14:40.245
has benefited from
my creative vision.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.580
Starting with you, Spike!

14:52.407 --> 14:52.887
You.

14:53.006 --> 14:53.562
Look.

14:53.824 --> 14:54.842
Fabulous!

14:55.582 --> 14:57.371
All because of you!

14:57.857 --> 15:01.738
Anything for my favorite dragon
and most supportive friend.

15:02.341 --> 15:04.439
Come! There's so
much more to do!

15:08.688 --> 15:09.506
Oh, no!

15:09.598 --> 15:10.720
Not you, too.

15:12.819 --> 15:14.776
What do you mean "not me, too"?

15:15.492 --> 15:18.163
Oh, judging by that outfit, I
thought for sure you'd--

15:18.184 --> 15:19.284
What? This?

15:19.320 --> 15:20.934
I just wanted to
try out a new look.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.040
You like?

15:24.669 --> 15:25.371
Hmm.

15:25.742 --> 15:28.999
Well, in that case, have you
seen anypony suspicious around?

15:29.484 --> 15:30.731
Uh, nope.

15:35.071 --> 15:35.978
Princess Twilight!

15:36.140 --> 15:38.136
The gazebo has been
turned into solid crystal

15:38.275 --> 15:40.807
and two ponies are now
trapped inside its walls!

15:47.449 --> 15:48.325
Hoo!

15:48.460 --> 15:52.074
No! I made a promise to Rarity
to keep this to myself.

15:52.415 --> 15:53.104
Hoo!

15:54.392 --> 15:57.274
But you're right
Owlowiscious, I have to tell.

15:57.769 --> 16:01.010
And once I do, I can forget
Rarity thinking of me

16:01.026 --> 16:02.755
as her most supportive friend.

16:03.769 --> 16:07.486
I can forget Rarity thinking
of me as a friend at all.

16:17.793 --> 16:19.008
I can't do it.

16:20.316 --> 16:22.589
I promised I'd keep all of
this between the three of us.

16:23.246 --> 16:24.191
Hoo!

16:24.860 --> 16:27.026
Of course, it's weird
that she meant me, her,

16:27.034 --> 16:28.150
and the spell book, but--

16:29.155 --> 16:31.065
The spell book! Of course!

16:31.373 --> 16:32.675
If I can get it away from her,

16:32.891 --> 16:34.891
I bet she won't be able
to use its magic anymore.

16:36.132 --> 16:38.360
<i>Oh, come on! It's</i>
<i>the perfect plan.</i>

16:39.176 --> 16:41.890
I just have to figure
out which way she went.

16:42.023 --> 16:43.340
<i>I can't see!</i>

16:49.260 --> 16:51.543
I'm thinking she's
headed this way.

17:08.376 --> 17:09.566
What do you think
you're doing?

17:10.321 --> 17:15.112
Me? I was just uh, basking
in your creative radiance.

17:16.401 --> 17:19.810
Oh, Spike, you do say
the nicest things!

17:20.577 --> 17:21.174
Thanks.

17:21.777 --> 17:23.449
Now where was I?

17:27.422 --> 17:28.105
Oh, yes!

17:28.546 --> 17:31.680
Gold-plated roof-tops
for everypony!

17:31.980 --> 17:34.048
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

17:40.056 --> 17:40.803
Spike!

17:44.729 --> 17:46.864
I have just had the
most marvellous idea!

17:50.552 --> 17:53.125
Of course you have;
you're Rarity.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.669
My work here in Ponyville
is nearly complete.

17:57.196 --> 17:59.947
Don't you think it's time
the rest of Equestria

17:59.962 --> 18:01.840
benefited from my
creative vision?

18:02.624 --> 18:03.781
Absolutely!

18:05.748 --> 18:07.600
I'm thinking we go by chariot.

18:07.871 --> 18:10.803
Or as everyone will soon
be calling them, "Rariot".

18:13.006 --> 18:15.342
Oh, yeah! We should
definitely go by--

18:19.968 --> 18:22.714
How...how did you do that?

18:23.221 --> 18:24.960
Why, whatever do you mean?

18:25.334 --> 18:28.232
The book. It's... I
mean... you don't...

18:28.915 --> 18:30.000
It's gone.

18:30.216 --> 18:31.240
The book is gone.

18:31.469 --> 18:32.115
Gone?

18:32.370 --> 18:33.424
Why it's right there.

18:35.363 --> 18:37.106
I need my book, Spike!

18:37.400 --> 18:39.026
What have you done
with my book?

18:40.641 --> 18:42.807
Why would I do anything
with your book?

18:43.057 --> 18:44.029
We're friends.

18:44.392 --> 18:46.720
It was probably the owl!

18:48.124 --> 18:48.872
Hoo!

18:49.701 --> 18:53.459
But, wait, I don't seem
to need it anymore, do I?

18:54.255 --> 18:56.087
Yes! Yes!

18:56.636 --> 18:59.469
I can feel its magic
flowing within me now.

18:59.847 --> 19:03.024
I'm so excited!
I'm so excited!

19:03.613 --> 19:04.798
I'm so scared.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.647
<i>Oh, the places</i>
<i>we'll go, Spike.</i>

19:07.028 --> 19:07.935
Manehattan.

19:08.062 --> 19:09.063
Phillydelphia.

19:09.211 --> 19:10.107
Canterlot.

19:10.768 --> 19:12.448
And there you'll
be by my side.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.499
Just as you've always
been here in Ponyville.

19:14.565 --> 19:17.157
Your constant praise and
adoration driving me

19:17.164 --> 19:18.349
to even greater heights

19:18.490 --> 19:20.265
until there isn't an
inch of Equestria

19:20.273 --> 19:22.115
that hasn't been
utterly transformed

19:22.200 --> 19:25.326
by my creative genius!

19:31.732 --> 19:32.325
No!

19:33.153 --> 19:34.868
What did you say?

19:35.153 --> 19:36.206
I said, "No!"

19:36.739 --> 19:37.828
You've been changing things,

19:37.838 --> 19:39.182
but you haven't been
making them better.

19:39.861 --> 19:41.964
I should have told you the
truth at the very beginning,

19:42.076 --> 19:42.626
but I didn't

19:42.638 --> 19:44.579
because I was trying to be
a supportive friend.

19:46.027 --> 19:50.124
But instead I let you
become something awful.

19:51.457 --> 19:52.208
Awful?

20:03.992 --> 20:05.326
What happened?

20:05.791 --> 20:07.892
Rarity, you're OK?

20:08.384 --> 20:10.569
I...I think so.

20:11.898 --> 20:14.788
Though by the looks of it,
something quite terrifying

20:14.798 --> 20:16.552
has happened to Ponyville.

20:17.736 --> 20:18.760
You happened.

20:19.278 --> 20:20.144
Me?

20:21.574 --> 20:23.564
The last part of the spell!

20:24.526 --> 20:26.846
"Only when true
words are spoken,

20:26.856 --> 20:29.539
will you finally be set free."

20:31.106 --> 20:32.228
The spell took over you

20:32.234 --> 20:34.195
and you wanted to change
everything in Equestria.

20:34.780 --> 20:37.399
I was afraid to tell you
how I really felt about it,

20:37.791 --> 20:40.462
but then I, I told
you the truth.

20:41.295 --> 20:45.034
Dearest Spike, you should never
be afraid to tell me the truth.

20:45.354 --> 20:46.944
We're friends, remember?

20:50.645 --> 20:52.597
<i>Today I learned how important it is</i>

20:52.626 --> 20:54.009
<i>to be honest with your friends</i>

20:54.019 --> 20:55.283
<i>when they're doing something</i>

20:55.293 --> 20:56.708
<i>that you don't think is right.</i>

20:56.997 --> 20:59.190
A true friend knows
that you're speaking up

20:59.340 --> 21:00.612
because you care about them.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.304
Spike!

21:02.700 --> 21:07.246
Never, ever, ever take another
book out of the library

21:07.365 --> 21:09.453
at the Castle without asking.

21:09.695 --> 21:11.229
Princess Cadance
and Princess Luna

21:11.235 --> 21:14.005
have much better things to do
than help me clean up Ponyville.

21:16.803 --> 21:18.565
Do you have any idea how
hard it was to reverse

21:18.575 --> 21:19.910
that much dark magic?

21:22.173 --> 21:23.451
You don't look so good.

21:24.913 --> 21:25.592
What?

21:25.838 --> 21:27.010
I'm just being honest.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.682
It's what good friends do.
