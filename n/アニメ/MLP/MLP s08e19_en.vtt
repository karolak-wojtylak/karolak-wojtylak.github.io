WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:05.237
I don't know, folks.

00:05.439 --> 00:08.674
She's been in
there a <i>long</i> time..

00:11.679 --> 00:14.847
Do you suppose the
Terrifying Trunk Escape

00:14.949 --> 00:16.582
is too much for her?

00:16.984 --> 00:20.252
What if the Great and Powerful
Trixie can't--

00:21.889 --> 00:23.489
Escape..?

00:24.792 --> 00:28.360
But if you're there,
who's in here!?

00:29.162 --> 00:31.562
Why, our volunteer of course!

00:33.400 --> 00:35.134
Crab-apple surprise!

00:35.236 --> 00:37.736
You should oughta tell a pony
before you go a-poofing 'em

00:37.838 --> 00:39.238
around a stage!

00:45.146 --> 00:48.047
Trixie, that was
an amazing show!

00:48.149 --> 00:49.949
Flurry Heart and I loved it.

00:50.051 --> 00:52.318
I'm so glad we decided to come.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.653
You two have a real chemistry.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.355
The Terrifying
Trunk Escape

00:56.457 --> 00:59.726
does require a great and
powerful assistant.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.496
The way you two worked together,
it's like you've known each

01:03.598 --> 01:05.731
other as long as
Twilight and I have.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.599
It was pretty fun.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.101
Of course, it was!

01:09.503 --> 01:12.104
There's nothing better than
a bond with another pony.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.006
You can share all
kinds of things.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.142
<i> ♪ Sunshine, sunshine,</i>
<i> ladybugs awake. ♪</i>

01:17.344 --> 01:20.145
<i> ♪ Clap your hooves and</i>
<i> do a little shake! ♪</i>

01:22.283 --> 01:25.150
I think we'll stick to
the stage magic for now.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.620
The great and powerful
Trixie doesn't chant.

02:07.945 --> 02:10.395
As much as I love
my one-pony show,

02:10.597 --> 02:12.297
it's always nice to
come to Ponyville

02:12.399 --> 02:15.500
and perform with my great
and powerful assistant.

02:15.602 --> 02:18.470
Cadance is right! We
do work well together.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.840
Doing a show with you is almost
as much fun as counseling

02:21.942 --> 02:23.475
students at Twilight's school--

02:23.577 --> 02:25.777
[gasp] -which I'm supposed
to be doing right now!

02:26.880 --> 02:27.713
See ya later!

02:32.453 --> 02:34.186
Excuse me,
Ms. Powerful?

02:34.488 --> 02:38.123
Heh heh! Usually ponies
just call me Trixie,

02:38.225 --> 02:40.726
but Ms. Powerful
has a nice ring!

02:41.228 --> 02:44.396
From here to Saddle Arabia,
I have seen nothing

02:44.498 --> 02:47.299
that compares with
your wondrous show.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.335
Would you consider blessing
my homeland with it?

02:50.437 --> 02:54.073
I<i> was</i> just about to
set out on tour... ugh..

02:54.375 --> 02:57.909
but Saddle Arabia is much
farther than my usual route--

03:00.180 --> 03:01.147
Heh heh.

03:01.249 --> 03:05.417
--and uh, my caravan might not
be suited for an extended tour.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.753
Mine is new and
quite spacious.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.755
If it would help
persuade you,

03:09.857 --> 03:12.424
I would happily trade
it for yours.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.360
Trade it? Heavens no!

03:15.562 --> 03:17.996
This is more than just some
great and powerful wagon

03:18.098 --> 03:19.331
you see before you.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.432
It is shelter.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.468
It is transportation.

03:22.870 --> 03:27.673
It is my only friend in the long
and lonely nights on the road!

03:27.775 --> 03:31.276
Very well, then I must see as
many of your performances

03:31.378 --> 03:33.445
as I can. If I
cannot convince you

03:33.547 --> 03:35.681
to bring your tour
to Saddle Arabia,

03:35.783 --> 03:39.218
I must be prepared to
relate its magnificence

03:39.420 --> 03:41.286
to your many fans there.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.655
Many fans, you say?

03:44.692 --> 03:48.226
Well, I suppose I could
consider the trip.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.561
Wonderful!

03:49.663 --> 03:51.797
I look forward to
seeing you on the road.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.566
And if you change your
mind about the caravans,

03:54.768 --> 03:56.101
my offer remains open.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.271
Hmmm..

03:59.473 --> 04:01.640
It's just so far away!

04:01.842 --> 04:05.043
Of course, I love visiting
new and exciting places,

04:05.145 --> 04:08.814
I am a<i> traveling</i>
magician after all.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.416
Hmm. Sounds like
your mind's made up.

04:11.718 --> 04:12.669
Not quite.

04:12.870 --> 04:16.721
The road is a lonely place,
and this trip even more so.

04:16.924 --> 04:21.727
I was hoping I might convince my
great and powerful assistant

04:21.829 --> 04:23.095
to come along.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.396
Really?

04:24.498 --> 04:25.465
Of course!

04:25.566 --> 04:27.933
You're not just my assistant
and my counselor,

04:28.135 --> 04:29.568
you're also my friend,

04:29.670 --> 04:31.903
and what's better
than a road trip with friends?

04:32.105 --> 04:32.938
Nothing!

04:33.140 --> 04:36.241
This will be the best
magical road trip ever!

04:39.880 --> 04:42.281
I should probably get somepony
to cover my student counseling

04:42.383 --> 04:43.582
duties while we're gone..

04:47.454 --> 04:48.955
Trixie, are you all right?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.358
One caravan for two all set!

04:52.860 --> 04:54.559
Oh, you brought luggage.

04:54.861 --> 04:58.263
Heh. I mean, of course
you brought luggage!

04:58.365 --> 04:59.216
You bet I did.

04:59.317 --> 05:02.768
Everything two ponies need for
the road trip of their lives!

05:03.904 --> 05:06.705
Three one-thousand piece
puzzles, one copy of Dragon Pit,

05:06.907 --> 05:08.907
the best board game in
the history of ponies,

05:09.009 --> 05:12.645
my famous collection of campfire
spices and an inflatable raft.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.713
Did I forget something?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.715
I can pop back to the
castle and grab it.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.884
Oh, no. It isn't that...

05:21.355 --> 05:23.288
Yeah... Maybe we
don't need the raft.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.858
Ah! We just
needed a little

05:26.960 --> 05:30.462
great and powerful
reorganization!

05:30.764 --> 05:31.863
Now... everything...

05:32.366 --> 05:33.332
Fits... Just...

05:34.134 --> 05:34.900
Fine!

05:36.403 --> 05:38.236
Ugh. Who am I kidding?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.339
My wagon is too small for us.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.908
I understand if you're
having second thoughts.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.309
Second thoughts?

05:44.611 --> 05:45.844
Are you kidding?

05:45.946 --> 05:49.014
This wagon isn't
small, it's.... cozy.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.717
And there's no such
thing as too cozy!

05:52.219 --> 05:53.852
Well all right, then!

05:53.954 --> 05:56.321
I guess it's time
to hit the road!

05:57.592 --> 05:59.658
I'll-- start us off...

06:06.033 --> 06:09.368
OK, maybe there is such
a thing as too cozy.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.509
You're sure you
wouldn't rather ride?

06:20.280 --> 06:21.146
I'm sure.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.549
And you're not backing out?

06:22.650 --> 06:26.251
The two of us sleeping in that
"cozy" caravan could get tricky.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.653
Trixie, there's plenty
of high-quality inns

06:28.755 --> 06:29.755
to stay at on the way.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.257
Don't worry about it.

06:31.358 --> 06:34.158
I am<i> not</i> backing out of the
greatest and most powerful

06:34.261 --> 06:37.529
road trip bonding experience
two ponies could ever have!

06:37.631 --> 06:41.199
Well, when you put it like that,
I'm actually kind of excited!

06:41.301 --> 06:42.767
Me too. Ah!

06:42.869 --> 06:44.936
Thank goodness we're not
Twilight or the others.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.805
They'd probably sing
a song about it.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.058
Oh! The marketplace.

08:47.160 --> 08:47.977
Perfect.

08:48.078 --> 08:51.695
I've learned the hard way that
life on the road requires very

08:51.798 --> 08:55.367
specific supplies and we
only have so many bits,

08:55.569 --> 08:58.403
so we'll have to
spend them wise-ly.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.842
Heh. Sorry about wasting
bits on street food.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.810
Oh, it's fine!

09:05.912 --> 09:07.712
Falafel Bonding, right?

09:08.014 --> 09:10.182
Besides, we still
have enough for...

09:10.784 --> 09:12.851
haycakes and juice.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.989
Um... why don't
we go there?

09:18.091 --> 09:19.024
Oh, no no no.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.126
I always buy my
haycakes here.

09:21.928 --> 09:25.130
So, we're just going to wait
in line for hours...

09:25.432 --> 09:28.033
uh.. which is totally cool!

09:28.235 --> 09:30.535
Waiting In Line Bonding, right?

09:31.672 --> 09:34.072
After our falafel purchase,

09:34.274 --> 09:36.541
we weren't able to get
everything on my list,

09:36.643 --> 09:39.077
but we are definitely
set for breakfast.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.346
And I'm sure we'll find
out that waiting in that

09:41.448 --> 09:43.348
super long line
was worth it.

09:43.750 --> 09:47.352
A few hiccups always happen;
we'll be back on the road

09:47.454 --> 09:49.621
to friendship after a
good night's sleep.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.289
We're all full!

09:52.993 --> 09:55.426
I-I'm sure we'll find something.

09:55.828 --> 09:56.461
Nope.

09:57.264 --> 09:57.963
Sorry.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.530
All full.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.502
Ah, the Glowpaz Festival.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.937
Somnambula is no doubt
filled to the brim.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.774
Luckily, travelers such as
ourselves have our caravans.

10:11.644 --> 10:12.494
Heh heh.

10:12.595 --> 10:14.845
You said there'd be
plenty of places to stay.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.416
"Don't even worry
about it," you said.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.618
You might have thought
to make a reservation.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.188
Um... I've been with you
singing and standing in line.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.723
When would I have done that?

10:25.125 --> 10:29.060
I don't know, but I'm starting
to think you aren't as great

10:29.162 --> 10:32.397
and powerful an
assistant as I thought.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.434
So, you just brought me
along to do your legwork!?

10:36.236 --> 10:39.604
[sigh] No. Of course not.

10:39.806 --> 10:40.839
I'm sorry.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.540
I'm just frustrated!

10:42.642 --> 10:46.912
I was really looking forward to
a relaxing night in a nice room.

10:47.014 --> 10:51.683
[sigh] Me too, but since there's
literally no room at the inns,

10:51.785 --> 10:53.786
I guess it's lucky
we've got the wagon.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.355
Sleeping In Tight
Quarters Bonding...

10:57.657 --> 10:59.391
Yaaaay.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.599
Is there something I can do

11:07.701 --> 11:10.702
to make things more
<i>comfortable</i> for you?

11:11.204 --> 11:13.138
You could get rid of this junk.

11:14.440 --> 11:19.844
Yes, well, before we throw away
the magical items it's taken me

11:19.946 --> 11:23.648
years to collect, we could
try switching hammocks.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.449
Fine!

11:33.751 --> 11:34.351
Ah!

11:36.329 --> 11:37.262
Starlight?

11:37.564 --> 11:38.496
Starlight!

11:38.598 --> 11:40.198
I think there's a
wild animal outside!

11:42.869 --> 11:43.902
Starlight!?

11:46.273 --> 11:47.238
STARLIGHT!

11:47.540 --> 11:48.673
Wha...? Huh?

11:48.775 --> 11:49.507
WHAT?

11:49.709 --> 11:50.675
I'm sorry.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.777
Your snoring is a bit...

11:52.879 --> 11:54.212
Loud? Heh heh.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.680
Yeah. I do that.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.749
I had my village convinced
we were being attacked

11:57.851 --> 11:59.250
by bears every night. Heh.

12:01.622 --> 12:04.556
[ahem] But we probably need a
better solution here.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.662
[sleepily] Ladies and gentleponies!

12:11.264 --> 12:16.068
The Great and Powerful
Trixie will now...

12:16.770 --> 12:17.836
Seriously!?

12:17.978 --> 12:19.978
Prepare to be
amazed....!

12:24.911 --> 12:27.212
<i>Sleep </i>well?

12:27.514 --> 12:29.013
Sure did.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.085
Is uh, that the last
of the hay cakes?

12:35.687 --> 12:37.922
Oh. yeah. Sorry.

12:38.024 --> 12:38.957
It's fine.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.493
I don't suppose
there's.. more juice?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.798
[glug glug] Ah!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.801
I guess we'll have
to re-supply.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.671
What a glorious
morning!

12:56.209 --> 12:58.476
I can't tell you how much
I am looking forward

12:58.578 --> 13:00.345
to the first show
of your tour.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.416
Is he going to be following
us for the whole time?

13:05.718 --> 13:07.218
I do not know.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.690
She's been in there a long time...

13:12.192 --> 13:15.593
Do you suppose the Terrifying
Trunk Escape is too much for a

13:15.695 --> 13:19.664
pony who drinks all the JUICE
and talks nonstop in her sleep!?

13:19.866 --> 13:22.733
What if the Great and <i>Powerful</i>
Trixie can't--

13:23.837 --> 13:27.939
<i>Sleep</i> because her roommate
snores like an Ursa Major?

13:29.242 --> 13:32.143
But if you're there,
who's in here?

13:38.018 --> 13:39.818
There's not much
room in here.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.420
At least you don't have to
sleep in it with another PONY!

13:46.526 --> 13:49.127
This show was much
better in Ponyville..

13:51.898 --> 13:54.432
Oh! Would <i>you</i> like
the last carrot?

13:54.734 --> 13:58.303
I know how fond you are of
eating the last of things.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.272
Oh, no. It might
make me thirsty

14:01.374 --> 14:04.942
and we don't have
anything to drink, so...

14:07.514 --> 14:11.049
The good news is I'm so
exhausted I could sleep

14:11.151 --> 14:13.818
through a stampede
of WILD boars,

14:14.020 --> 14:15.486
which you'll be
delighted to know

14:15.588 --> 14:18.089
is only slightly louder
than your snoring.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.058
Well,<i> I'm</i> looking forward
to rehearsing the act

14:21.160 --> 14:22.112
with you all night.

14:22.213 --> 14:27.065
So diligent of you to go over
it and over it in your sleep.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.867
Practice makes perfect.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.435
Not today, it didn't.

14:30.937 --> 14:34.172
Well, I'm sorry
you're so miserable!

14:34.474 --> 14:37.442
Really!? Because if you wanted to
make things more comfortable,

14:37.544 --> 14:39.377
you could always
pare down a bit!

14:42.048 --> 14:45.350
Well, since you're <i>so</i>
concerned about space,

14:45.652 --> 14:47.185
you can have it all!

14:47.287 --> 14:50.088
I'll sleep under the stars where
at least the wild animals

14:50.190 --> 14:52.257
will be QUIETER THAN YOU!

14:56.262 --> 15:00.131
I do not mean to interrupt, but
it seems there is trouble

15:00.233 --> 15:01.433
on the road to friendship.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.402
Ha ha ha ha. <i>Ya think?</i>

15:11.211 --> 15:13.178
WHERE'S MY WAGON!?

15:13.580 --> 15:17.415
I traded it to that pony
from Saddle Arabia for his!

15:17.617 --> 15:19.951
He even threw in
a pair of robes!

15:20.353 --> 15:21.819
♪ [horror sting] ♪

15:25.058 --> 15:26.858
YOU WHAT?

15:27.060 --> 15:31.095
I traded the old, worn-out wagon
that was too small for us

15:31.197 --> 15:34.499
for this nice, new, spacious
one that we can both enjoy.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.203
BUT [spluttering] WHO SAID
YOU COULD DO THAT?

15:38.405 --> 15:40.204
Nopony. I just did it.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.708
Ah! Now we both have
plenty of room

15:43.810 --> 15:46.177
and you didn't even have
to give anything away.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.747
<i> Au contraire!</i>

15:49.849 --> 15:51.883
I DID give something away!

15:52.085 --> 15:55.786
I gave away my wagon,
and my best friend.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.924
Oh, I'm sorry!

16:00.126 --> 16:02.226
I didn't realize you
were better friends

16:02.328 --> 16:04.996
with that beat-up old wagon
than you are with <i>me</i>.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.766
Well, it's easy when the
wagon is a better friend.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.402
<i> It</i> would have NEVER
traded<i> you</i> away!

16:11.804 --> 16:12.871
That's ridiculous.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.939
Oh, it<i> is</i> ridiculous.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.809
In fact, this whole
tour is ridiculous.

16:17.911 --> 16:21.045
I don't even know why I
invited you in the first place!

16:21.547 --> 16:24.282
Well! Maybe I should
just head home!

16:24.384 --> 16:26.551
I think that's a
very good idea.

16:26.653 --> 16:30.455
And you can take this horrible,
giant caravan WITH YOU!

16:30.757 --> 16:31.389
Fine!

16:31.491 --> 16:32.256
Good!

16:49.042 --> 16:51.611
Goodness! Ms. Powerful.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.547
But where is
your assistant?

16:55.749 --> 16:58.249
I had hoped providing you
with a more comfortable

16:58.351 --> 17:01.219
means of conveyance would
allow you to once more

17:01.321 --> 17:04.622
dazzle the crowds with
mystifying feats of magic!

17:04.924 --> 17:07.725
Normally, that sort of
flattery would suffice,

17:07.827 --> 17:12.029
but today we must discuss your
dishonest and unfair procurement

17:12.131 --> 17:13.398
of my wagon!

17:13.700 --> 17:16.200
I desired your wagon and
provided one of equal

17:16.302 --> 17:18.169
or better value in return.

17:18.271 --> 17:21.272
It seems like a perfectly
honest and fair trade to me.

17:21.674 --> 17:25.076
Unfortunately, it is
more nuanced than that!

17:25.478 --> 17:28.346
I'm sure it is, but I
am eager to set out.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.714
If you'll excuse me.

17:37.657 --> 17:40.926
I am willing to wait
as long as you are.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.095
Hah! We'll just see about that!

17:52.505 --> 17:55.974
You know, even if I was
willing to reverse the trade,

17:56.076 --> 17:58.776
you don't have my caravan
to offer in return.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.745
Ooh! Details!

18:17.597 --> 18:18.730
You all seemed...

18:19.232 --> 18:21.566
a lot less threatening
when there were two of us!

18:24.537 --> 18:25.169
Ah!

18:27.807 --> 18:28.973
This place is awful!

18:29.075 --> 18:30.741
How did I not see it before?

18:35.715 --> 18:38.016
Hey! It's one of those
traveling ponies!

18:38.218 --> 18:40.585
Your song really
inspired us!

18:40.687 --> 18:44.022
We decided we need to head off
on the road to friendship too.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.257
It sure beats the
road to deliveries!

18:46.459 --> 18:49.093
Yep. Sometimes traveling
together is hard.

18:49.195 --> 18:51.262
You reminded us you
can also make it fun!

18:51.564 --> 18:52.597
Thanks again!

18:52.699 --> 18:53.332
Whoo hoo!

18:58.771 --> 19:00.871
Steaming hot beverage?

19:00.973 --> 19:02.640
Thank you, no.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.645
What are you two doing?

19:07.847 --> 19:09.080
Taking a stand!

19:09.282 --> 19:10.948
By lying down!

19:11.050 --> 19:13.819
Not that you care,
wagon trader-awayer!

19:14.921 --> 19:17.288
I'm afraid I'm still
not interested,

19:17.390 --> 19:20.325
despite your assistant's
convenient appearance.

19:20.727 --> 19:23.561
Trixie, I came
back to apologize.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.197
I should never have
traded away the wagon.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.798
It wasn't mine to trade!

19:27.900 --> 19:29.400
It belongs to my friend.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.270
Hmmm. If you truly
were friends,

19:32.472 --> 19:36.474
I suppose I'd be honor-bound
to reverse the trade.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.542
OK. Fine, we're friends.

19:38.644 --> 19:39.978
Best friends who
share a deep bond,

19:40.080 --> 19:41.712
but weren't prepared for
the emotional challenges

19:41.814 --> 19:43.448
of traveling. Happy?

19:44.050 --> 19:45.483
I am still unconvinced.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.352
Perhaps you could
<i>prove</i> your friendship.

19:48.754 --> 19:49.687
How!?

19:49.789 --> 19:52.656
Er... we could do our
friendship chant.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.961
Oh, right...

19:57.263 --> 20:00.064
Our world famous
"Chant of Friendship"!

20:00.166 --> 20:03.834
That we do all the time because
we're such great friends.

20:04.704 --> 20:09.340
[making it up as they go]
<i> Mmmagic, tri--mmagic.</i>

20:09.542 --> 20:17.714
<i> Poo-uff of sma-oke,</i>
<i> Wondu-wave your hoof-ooves</i>

20:17.917 --> 20:22.152
<i> and tal-ell a</i>
<i> lo-ittle jawww-oke!</i>

20:22.254 --> 20:22.953
Ha ha!

20:27.260 --> 20:31.562
That was the <i>worst</i> friendship
chant I have ever heard

20:31.864 --> 20:34.765
and you two were clearly
making it up as you went.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.868
But! Only true friends
would be willing

20:37.970 --> 20:40.304
to act so ridiculous
for one another.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.006
So you'll give back
the wagon?

20:42.708 --> 20:45.676
Though, I'd suggest
heading back to Ponyville.

20:45.778 --> 20:50.815
I'm not sure Saddle
Arabia is ready for..... this.

20:51.817 --> 20:52.683
That's fair.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.457
I'm sorry your Saddle
Arabian tour was ruined.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.860
Honestly, I don't think I could
have stood one more second

21:02.962 --> 21:03.946
on the road.

21:04.047 --> 21:06.931
At a certain point, I don't
even like traveling with myself.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.403
It is a lot harder
than I thought.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.705
Still, I'm glad we tried.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.641
Mostly so we know
not to do it again.

21:17.794 --> 21:19.744
I think it's made our
friendship greater

21:19.846 --> 21:21.946
and more powerful than ever!

21:23.316 --> 21:25.883
You know, there's actually
plenty of room in here

21:25.985 --> 21:27.652
for a one-pony nap.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.687
Is the show over?
