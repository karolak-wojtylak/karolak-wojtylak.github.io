Not everycreature celebrate

00:30.597 --> 00:33.799
Yeah. Dragons don't
do pony holidays.

00:33.901 --> 00:34.967
Spike: Sure we do!

00:35.169 --> 00:36.835
I LOVE Hearth's
Warming Eve.

00:36.937 --> 00:39.505
It's all about friends,
and presents, and family,

00:39.607 --> 00:41.006
and.. presents!

00:41.508 --> 00:44.710
It's also about putting aside
differences to come together,

00:44.812 --> 00:47.846
like the Earth ponies, pegasi,
and unicorns did

00:47.948 --> 00:49.448
on the first holiday.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.184
Oh! Is that why you put
their fire of friendship

00:52.286 --> 00:53.152
on top of the tree?

00:53.254 --> 00:54.986
To help us remember
their unity?

00:55.088 --> 00:56.856
AND 'cause it looks cool.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.858
This is my favorite
day of the year!

01:01.262 --> 01:02.728
Not that I don't
like the other ones.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.596
Tuesdays are great!

01:07.000 --> 01:09.234
Yona like any day that
is start of Winter Break.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.937
Two whole weeks
without classes.

01:12.039 --> 01:14.040
How will Ocellus survive?

01:14.741 --> 01:15.317
Heheh..

01:15.442 --> 01:17.009
I think you'll all
enjoy the time off

01:17.111 --> 01:18.643
to be home with
your families.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.579
To celebrate your
own traditions.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.314
Attention, everycreature!

01:22.416 --> 01:23.815
School is officially out!

01:24.117 --> 01:26.785
Happy Holidays,
and we'll see you
after the break.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.457
And for those of you
traveling outside Equestria...

01:32.659 --> 01:34.926
Yeah, shouldn't you guys
be getting ready to go?

01:35.128 --> 01:38.263
If you miss that train,
it's a really long walk.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.732
Go pack up, and we'll
take you to the station.

01:50.577 --> 01:53.312
It's that new bowtie
I wanted, isn't it?

01:53.414 --> 01:54.880
You'll have
to wait and see!

01:55.482 --> 01:56.481
I'm waiting!

01:56.683 --> 01:59.185
But in the meantime,
I'm shaking.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.886
Wh--what happened?

03:07.588 --> 03:10.089
Everything's ruined;
that's what's happened!

03:12.626 --> 03:15.827
And I don't think
it was an accident!

03:17.197 --> 03:19.865
Somepony was up here!

03:21.468 --> 03:22.301
Over there!

03:25.105 --> 03:25.971
Outside!

03:32.112 --> 03:33.645
That's the Students' Quarters!

03:37.318 --> 03:39.951
Might as well
give up, whoever you are!

03:40.053 --> 03:41.720
We got ya
cornered!

03:43.123 --> 03:44.123
Hello?

03:45.025 --> 03:46.291
Is anypony there?

03:46.693 --> 03:47.893
I'll check the
back door!

03:48.795 --> 03:49.694
What's happening?

03:49.897 --> 03:52.164
[gasp] Another decorating party!?

03:52.966 --> 03:54.633
Has anycreature come in here?

03:54.935 --> 03:56.034
Well... yeah.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.302
All of us did.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.203
To pack?

03:58.305 --> 03:59.571
Like you told us to?

03:59.773 --> 04:00.739
After that.

04:00.941 --> 04:01.807
Did you hear
anything?

04:02.509 --> 04:03.708
Uh uh.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.577
What's up?

04:05.679 --> 04:07.178
Yona done packing!

04:07.815 --> 04:09.148
Is something wrong?

04:10.150 --> 04:11.149
The back door's locked.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.084
No way out!

04:12.586 --> 04:14.953
But whoever did it had
to have come in here.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.021
We saw them!

04:16.223 --> 04:18.356
Whoever did<i> what</i> ?

04:19.993 --> 04:22.060
Whoa... That...

04:22.262 --> 04:23.996
Is so not cool.

04:24.698 --> 04:28.333
And whoever did it
ran into your rooms.

04:28.735 --> 04:32.538
No one came out. And all
of you are still here.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.941
One of you must have done this!

04:36.543 --> 04:40.612
But why would any of you wanna
sabotage Hearth's Warming Eve?

04:44.685 --> 04:46.685
Uh! Yak not do this.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.087
Yona offended by accusation.

04:50.557 --> 04:51.756
We don't know what happened.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.692
Maybe this wasn't
even on purpose.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.961
But I want to give
whoever caused this mess

04:56.063 --> 04:58.864
a chance to tell the truth
and explain themselves.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.766
I'll make it easy for you.

05:00.968 --> 05:01.900
Close your eyes.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.976
Now, if you did this,
raise your hoof.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.210
Or claw.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.378
Or whatever.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.482
C'mon, Spike.

05:17.584 --> 05:18.584
Looks like we have to--

05:19.186 --> 05:20.986
Spike. You can
open your eyes.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.354
What? Oh!

05:22.456 --> 05:24.222
Er.. what about me?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.524
You ALL can.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.358
Heh heh!

05:27.360 --> 05:30.695
But since nocreature took
responsibility for this mess,

05:30.797 --> 05:32.664
you're ALL gonna have
to help clean it up

05:32.766 --> 05:34.066
before you can go home.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.204
Why do I have to stay?

05:39.306 --> 05:41.072
Aw! But the holidays!

05:45.746 --> 05:46.662
While you're cleaning,

05:46.763 --> 05:48.779
we'll bring you into my
office one at a time.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.249
Since Honesty is one of
the Elements of Harmony,

05:51.351 --> 05:54.085
we want to give you each a
chance to tell us the truth.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.589
And once we find out who
did it, just you wait!

05:57.691 --> 05:59.124
We're gonna--we'll...

05:59.926 --> 06:01.394
What are we gonna
do exactly?

06:01.896 --> 06:04.195
[sigh] The guilty party
won't be going home

06:04.297 --> 06:05.730
over Hearth's
Warming Break.

06:05.832 --> 06:08.933
She or he will stay here
for some one-on-one

06:09.035 --> 06:10.335
friendship lessons.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.804
But what if none
of us confesses?

06:13.306 --> 06:14.139
Then...

06:15.342 --> 06:17.742
I guess there's no
holidays for anycreature.

06:17.844 --> 06:19.678
You'll all stay
over the break.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.424
All right, let's get
to the bottom of this.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.292
Who wants to be
interviewed first?

06:35.329 --> 06:36.728
Eh. I'll go.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.929
Beats mop duty.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.366
Hey, I know!

06:41.468 --> 06:43.402
We can make a
game out of this!

06:43.504 --> 06:45.804
See who finishes
cleaning up first!

06:46.940 --> 06:48.540
Whoo hoo!
Yak win!

06:48.642 --> 06:50.275
Yak best at cleaning!

06:54.581 --> 06:56.648
Let's save time and
cut to the chase.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.585
Which one of you did it?

07:00.287 --> 07:02.687
I would never do
something this horrible!

07:02.789 --> 07:04.656
I<i> love</i> Hearth's
Warming Eve!

07:04.758 --> 07:07.626
And I do NOT want to
miss going home for it.

07:07.728 --> 07:11.529
Huh. I didn't even know Changelings
celebrated Hearth's Warming.

07:11.731 --> 07:12.764
Oh, yes!

07:12.866 --> 07:14.300
It's our favorite holiday!

07:14.401 --> 07:17.435
Well, since Headmare Twilight
shared it with us last year.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.605
She gave our hive very
clear instructions.

07:22.542 --> 07:23.375
[ahem]

07:23.477 --> 07:26.545
"Welcome to the traditions
and fun of Hearth's Warming!

07:26.647 --> 07:27.713
Here's a guide to help you

07:27.815 --> 07:30.682
enjoy this celebration
of pony history.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.952
Families start the holidays
by putting the tree up!"

07:42.329 --> 07:43.228
"Thirsty?

07:43.330 --> 07:45.364
Dive into some Holiday Punch!"

07:51.271 --> 07:54.873
"Just before bed, everypony
exchanges gifts."

07:56.677 --> 07:59.845
It doesn't say how long
we keep doing this.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.884
"And to finish celebrating,
you can build a fire.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.653
Light it up.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.221
And sing carols."

08:09.623 --> 08:13.925
<i> ♪ Carols</i>
<i> carols carols carols ♪</i>

08:18.999 --> 08:22.667
You<i> might</i> have misunderstood
things just a little.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.803
Eh, we may not have
done everything

08:24.905 --> 08:26.805
exactly the way you do.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.807
But we made our
own traditions!

08:28.909 --> 08:31.576
And I can't wait to do
it all again this year!

08:31.678 --> 08:33.678
If we ever get out of here.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.880
Ocellus? Your turn.

08:45.025 --> 08:45.958
What happened?

08:46.460 --> 08:47.359
What do you think happened?

08:47.461 --> 08:48.760
I told her I didn't do it.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.730
Agh! Yona tired
of waiting.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.999
Yaks ALWAYS home
for holidays.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.336
How do you celebrate Hearth's
Warming in Yakyakistan, Yona?

08:57.638 --> 08:58.803
Yaks do not.

08:59.005 --> 09:01.206
Our holiday MUCH better.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.509
Is called "Snilldar
Fest." Night before,

09:04.611 --> 09:08.747
yaks gather things to smash,
and put them in big pile.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.116
Then in morning,
we smash them!

09:11.418 --> 09:14.586
In afternoon, we smash them
again. In evening--

09:14.688 --> 09:17.322
So.. it's just about
smashing stuff.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.224
Like all your
other holidays.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.960
No! How griffon
get that idea?

09:22.062 --> 09:24.896
This holiday about
so much more.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.264
Last year, for
example.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.101
Most perfect
Snilldar ever...

09:31.371 --> 09:33.738
<i> Whole family.</i>
<i> Grandpa Grandma Yak,</i>

09:34.040 --> 09:36.407
<i> Yona's Brother Sister</i>
<i> Mother Father Yak.</i>

09:36.609 --> 09:39.210
<i> All go to woods,</i>
<i> singing Yak Song.</i>

09:39.312 --> 09:44.916
<i> ♪ Yak song! Yak song!</i>
<i> Not very long! Sing again! ♪</i>

09:45.318 --> 09:51.122
<i> ♪ Yak song! Yak song!</i>
<i> Not very long! Sing again! ♪</i>

09:51.224 --> 09:56.995
<i> ♪ Yak song! Yak song!</i>
<i> Not very long! Sing again! ♪</i>

09:57.197 --> 10:00.131
<i> Calves in family pick</i>
<i> out perfect Smashing Log.</i>

10:02.202 --> 10:03.502
<i> Then Yaks smash it.</i>

10:11.712 --> 10:16.114
<i> Then Yak Family build perfect</i>
<i> snow fort... and smash it!</i>

10:22.489 --> 10:26.558
<i> Then we hang perfect things</i>
<i> on perfect moss pile, and...</i>

10:26.760 --> 10:28.427
[All] You smash it.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.496
What you think Yaks
are, barbarians?

10:31.698 --> 10:34.866
Moss pile is for
special family rituals.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.602
Last year, ritual for Yona.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.438
<i> All Yak family</i>
<i> gather around Yona.</i>

10:41.942 --> 10:45.010
<i> And braid Yona hair</i>
<i> for first time.</i>

10:47.814 --> 10:52.217
So to recap... your holiday
is about smashing things,

10:52.319 --> 10:53.418
and family.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.554
Two most perfect things
ever, put together.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.356
Happy Snilldar Fest!

11:01.495 --> 11:03.995
Happy Snilldar to
you too, Yona.

11:04.097 --> 11:07.866
It's so cool to learn new
traditions from new friends!

11:12.539 --> 11:14.839
Yeah, well one of
these "new friends"

11:14.941 --> 11:16.441
has gotten us
all in trouble.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.143
And they'd better
confess soon.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.212
Ocellus: Sandbar?

11:19.713 --> 11:22.580
Sorry, but they said they
want you to go in next.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.418
Why the rush to
get home, Smolder?

11:27.520 --> 11:31.055
Like you said, dragons don't
really have holidays, do they?

11:31.157 --> 11:31.757
Meh.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.092
[gasp] That's so sad!

11:34.194 --> 11:36.595
You must do<i> something</i>
in the winter for fun.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.964
Well, we do have
"The Feast of Fire".

11:40.066 --> 11:42.500
Every dragon gets together
and tells stories.

11:42.602 --> 11:45.136
The best one wins a
pile of gemstones.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.339
Ooh! What story won last year?

11:47.941 --> 11:50.375
It was called "A
Dream Come True."

11:50.477 --> 11:52.744
Come on, now you've
gotta tell it!

11:52.946 --> 11:54.413
Uh. Fine.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.883
Once upon a time, there was
this sad little dragon.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.122
<i> Her name was Scales.</i>

12:04.224 --> 12:07.625
<i> She lived alone in</i>
<i> the wilderness with</i>
<i> nothing to eat.</i>

12:09.429 --> 12:14.132
<i> But one night, as she sat</i>
<i> alone in a storm, she</i>
<i> heard something.</i>

12:15.335 --> 12:17.902
<i> It was the Dragon Lord!</i>

12:18.204 --> 12:20.505
<i> Scales was scared, but the</i>
<i> Dragon Lord told her</i>

12:20.607 --> 12:24.475
<i> not to be afraid; that he was</i>
<i> taking her to the Dragon Lands</i>

12:24.577 --> 12:26.277
<i> for a great feast.</i>

12:36.389 --> 12:39.424
<i> Scales sat with the Dragon</i>
<i> Lord's family and friends and</i>

12:39.526 --> 12:44.195
<i> had the biggest, best dinner</i>
<i> of gemstones she'd ever eaten.</i>

12:44.297 --> 12:46.931
<i> Then, while the dragons</i>
<i> were telling stories,</i>

12:47.033 --> 12:50.935
<i> Scales thought it would be</i>
<i> so easy to seize power</i>

12:51.037 --> 12:54.406
<i> from this feeble and</i>
<i> sensitive Dragon Lord.</i>

12:54.508 --> 12:57.342
<i> She saw her chance</i>
<i> and TOOK IT!</i>

12:59.412 --> 13:01.513
<i> She claimed the</i>
<i> bloodstone scepter</i>

13:01.615 --> 13:03.848
<i> and took over the</i>
<i> Dragon Lands.</i>

13:04.150 --> 13:05.583
Bwahahah!

13:05.685 --> 13:08.619
<i> ...and forced the Dragon Lord</i>
<i> to live out in the cold</i>

13:08.821 --> 13:11.155
<i> just as she used to do.</i>

13:13.960 --> 13:16.495
That's a horrible story!

13:17.097 --> 13:18.062
Maybe to you..

13:18.164 --> 13:19.764
But dragons like
hearing about weak,

13:19.866 --> 13:21.566
kind creatures
getting defeated.

13:21.868 --> 13:22.901
[Rainbow Dash] Silverstream!

13:23.303 --> 13:24.035
You're up.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.404
Let's go!

13:29.609 --> 13:31.276
So, did you tell
them you did it?

13:31.578 --> 13:32.844
What? No way!

13:32.946 --> 13:33.945
Why would I say that?

13:34.047 --> 13:35.880
You already live
in Ponyville.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.116
Staying here over
break is no big deal.

13:38.318 --> 13:42.921
School of Friendship good place
for pony to have pony holiday.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.657
I'd still rather spend it
with my family at home.

13:45.759 --> 13:47.325
Oh! That reminds me!

13:47.627 --> 13:50.228
I have the BEST
holiday story ever!

13:50.330 --> 13:54.232
It's called "The Day My
Hearth's Warming Doll

13:54.334 --> 13:56.701
Almost Fell into the Fire!"

13:56.903 --> 13:58.903
[All] Ohhhhh!

13:59.005 --> 14:01.940
<i> Just before we went to</i>
<i> bed, my mom, my dad,</i>

14:02.042 --> 14:04.542
<i> and my sister all put our</i>
<i> Hearth's Warming Dolls</i>

14:04.644 --> 14:07.679
<i> up on the mantle, just</i>
<i> like we do every year.</i>

14:07.781 --> 14:09.080
<i> But THIS year...</i>

14:09.182 --> 14:13.317
<i> I put my doll too close</i>
<i> to the edge and it FELL!</i>

14:13.419 --> 14:17.187
[slowly] NOOOOOOO!

14:19.426 --> 14:20.192
And!?

14:21.594 --> 14:22.761
My doll hit the floor.

14:22.863 --> 14:26.130
BUT! It could have
gone in the fire!

14:27.232 --> 14:28.666
That's a great story.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.168
And you told it
really well.

14:30.770 --> 14:33.138
Yeah. It was a Hearth's
Warming miracle!

14:33.940 --> 14:34.739
Next!

14:35.976 --> 14:37.375
Smolder, come with me.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.610
Yona, Twilight's
waiting for you.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.516
The last two.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.720
So if neither one of them
confesses, that means...

14:49.222 --> 14:51.422
We're never going home!

14:55.896 --> 14:57.595
We'll be here forever!

14:57.797 --> 14:59.397
Beyond forever.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.701
But I can't miss the Three
Days of Freedom Celebration!

15:03.003 --> 15:05.037
How long does that last?

15:05.639 --> 15:09.974
It used to be only ONE day, but
now to commemorate our escape

15:10.076 --> 15:14.279
from the Storm King,
we're adding two more
days of awesome!

15:14.481 --> 15:15.214
See!

15:16.016 --> 15:17.182
There's a book?

15:17.384 --> 15:20.385
Mm hm! Queen Novo had these
made for the Mt. Aris

15:20.487 --> 15:23.421
board of tourism. To
explain it all to guests!

15:27.694 --> 15:30.028
<i> We'll spend the first</i>
<i> night in Seaquestria,</i>

15:30.130 --> 15:31.596
<i> thanking the ocean</i>
<i> for protecting us</i>

15:31.698 --> 15:33.131
<i> from the Storm King.</i>

15:34.467 --> 15:41.039
<i> Sea-dancing, whale-singing,</i>
<i> shell-stringing...</i>

15:41.341 --> 15:42.441
<i> Lots of "ings."</i>

15:44.477 --> 15:46.979
<i> The second day will</i>
<i> be on Mt. Aris,</i>

15:48.281 --> 15:50.448
<i> with sky dancing,</i>
<i> and a wind song</i>

15:50.550 --> 15:52.017
<i> in the Harmonizing</i> Heights

15:52.119 --> 15:53.852
<i> to celebrate the Storm</i>
<i> King's defeat.</i>

15:55.422 --> 15:57.422
<i> Then the third day,</i>

15:57.624 --> 16:01.860
<i> everycreature will party</i>
<i> together, on land AND sea.</i>

16:02.562 --> 16:04.595
<i> Grandparents and parents</i>
<i> and sisters, uncles,</i>

16:04.697 --> 16:07.198
<i> brothers, acquaintances,</i>
<i> neighbours and cousins.</i>

16:10.236 --> 16:11.603
<i> And at the end of the night,</i>

16:12.005 --> 16:14.605
<i> Queen Novo is going to</i>
<i> give out presents!</i>

16:17.677 --> 16:20.445
Wait. Hold on. Cousins?

16:20.647 --> 16:21.546
What are those?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.448
Your aunt's and
uncle's children?

16:23.550 --> 16:25.184
You know, part of your family.

16:25.986 --> 16:29.587
Heh. Oh, you're teasing
us again, right?

16:32.292 --> 16:34.759
I'm guessing neither
one of you confessed.

16:35.761 --> 16:37.662
Headmare Twilight
say wait here.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.899
Maybe they're changing their
minds about sending us home.

16:41.001 --> 16:41.933
Why would they?

16:42.135 --> 16:44.035
Face it. We're stuck here.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.238
But, but, I
HAVE to go home!

16:47.640 --> 16:50.141
My mom makes the
best kelp fritters.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.944
How can you be so
cool about this?

16:54.180 --> 16:54.746
We're mad.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.181
We just show it
differently.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.316
More like you don't
show it at all.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.052
What pony getting at?

17:01.254 --> 17:03.388
Maybe it wasn't
just one prankster.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.323
Maybe there were
three of you!

17:05.425 --> 17:08.860
And you're trying to hide
your guilt by not being upset!

17:09.162 --> 17:11.196
It does make sense..

17:12.198 --> 17:13.498
Guys, stop it.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.535
Or maybe whoever did it is
only pretending to be upset.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.703
To throw us off.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.672
Me? But I didn't!

17:21.274 --> 17:22.574
Come on, let it go.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.549
Come on, Ocellus,
you know you did it!

17:31.651 --> 17:32.917
Just fess up!

17:38.391 --> 17:40.625
I SAID stop fighting!

17:40.927 --> 17:42.994
That's not what the
holidays are about.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.164
No matter what you call
them, or how you celebrate.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.601
Do you know how
lucky you all are?

17:50.803 --> 17:52.971
With your stories about
sharing, and kindness,

17:53.073 --> 17:54.639
and getting together
with everycreature

17:54.741 --> 17:55.840
that you care about?

17:56.777 --> 17:59.644
But... Griffons do
that too, don't they?

17:59.746 --> 18:02.414
Some holiday
about a moon?

18:02.616 --> 18:05.016
[sigh] Blue Moon Festival.

18:05.118 --> 18:08.052
The one time of year
when Griffons are nice to each other.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.521
Well, as nice as we can be.

18:12.092 --> 18:15.126
<i> Families get together to</i>
<i> eat and then complain</i>
<i> about the food.</i>

18:15.228 --> 18:17.528
<i> And give each other</i>
<i> presents they don't like.</i>

18:17.630 --> 18:19.931
<i> And mostly just try not</i>
<i> to yell at each other.</i>

18:20.133 --> 18:22.700
Well, at least you get
to be with your family!

18:22.902 --> 18:23.602
No...

18:24.304 --> 18:25.870
Because I don't have a family.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.641
Sandbar:<i> What about</i>
<i> Grandpa Gruff?</i>

18:29.843 --> 18:30.775
Gallus:<i> That's just his name.</i>

18:30.877 --> 18:32.811
<i> He's not anygriff's</i>
<i> actual grandpa.</i>

18:35.582 --> 18:38.116
<i> I felt like I never had</i>
<i> a place in Griffonstone.</i>

18:41.654 --> 18:44.624
Then I came here,
and well, met all of you.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.326
So I don't want to
go home for the break.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.129
And that's why... I did it!

18:51.431 --> 18:54.232
[gasp] Griffon mess
up decorations?

18:54.734 --> 18:55.833
Yeah....

18:56.035 --> 18:56.835
It was me.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.236
I put goo powder in
the Fire of Friendship.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.841
So it wasn't Ocellus?

19:03.543 --> 19:05.944
Why would you ruin
things for us?

19:06.546 --> 19:07.979
I didn't plan to!

19:08.081 --> 19:09.647
I just figured if I
made a mess,

19:09.749 --> 19:11.816
our teachers would make
us stay to clean up.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.118
We'd be together
a little longer.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.554
Well. It worked, didn't it?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.122
Better than I thought.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.891
When Headmare Twilight
threatened to cancel

19:19.993 --> 19:23.328
winter break, that
meant I would get to
be with all of you,

19:23.530 --> 19:25.363
through the entire holiday!

19:25.465 --> 19:27.065
That's why I didn't confess.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.934
So why are you
admitting this now?

19:30.336 --> 19:33.772
I hated seeing all you fighting
and blaming each other.

19:34.074 --> 19:36.708
That's the opposite of what
ALL your holidays mean.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.643
Except maybe yours, Smolder.

19:41.081 --> 19:43.448
I can't keep all of you from
the happiness of your homes

19:43.550 --> 19:45.683
and families just
because I feel bad.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.020
I'm sorry.

19:49.122 --> 19:51.722
Don't worry, you won't
have to tell our teachers.

19:51.924 --> 19:52.691
I will.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.259
Twilight: You don't have to.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.294
We already know.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.598
We kinda guessed
it was you.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.434
But we wanted to give you
the chance to tell the truth.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.936
I'm proud that you did.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.837
And I'm glad to see you've
been paying attention

20:06.939 --> 20:09.474
in Professor Applejack's
honesty classes.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.776
But you're still gonna
have to make amends.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.980
And stay over break for
extra friendship lessons,
by yourself.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.583
I'll stay with him.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.218
Me, too!

20:20.720 --> 20:22.320
Yona stay also!

20:22.522 --> 20:23.688
I'm staying!

20:26.125 --> 20:26.825
What?

20:27.527 --> 20:28.793
All right.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.830
I guess pony holidays
can't be that bad.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.398
Now you can finally
know what it's like

20:34.500 --> 20:37.702
to spend Hearth's Warming with
friends who care about you.

20:39.239 --> 20:42.674
Looks like they don't really
need any extra lessons.

20:43.176 --> 20:45.076
Since you obviously know
that Hearth's Warming

20:45.178 --> 20:47.612
is about coming
together, I'd be honored

20:47.714 --> 20:50.248
if all of you would
join my friends as guests

20:50.350 --> 20:51.649
at our holiday table.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.488
After we finish cleaning up.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.331
Hey, this reminds
me of another story!

21:07.533 --> 21:12.703
The Time I Almost Spilled
Grape Juice on the White Couch.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.039
Does it have a
depressing ending?

21:15.241 --> 21:17.742
I'm not sure pony
stories work that way.

21:19.513 --> 21:22.780
Um. Gallus want Yona
braid feathers?

21:22.882 --> 21:24.949
Uuuh. Pass.

21:25.351 --> 21:28.452
<i> ♪ Hearth's Warming Eve is</i>
