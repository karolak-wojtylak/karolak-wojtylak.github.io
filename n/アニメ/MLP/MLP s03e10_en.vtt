00:07.930 --> 00:10.640
I love it when Princess Celestia
comes to Ponyville!

00:10.790 --> 00:13.400
I got my hooves shined
just like Rarity for the occasion.

00:13.550 --> 00:16.410
- Ya like?
- I certainly do!

00:16.820 --> 00:18.750
I'm surprised she's not here yet.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.580
I wonder what's taking so long?

00:20.730 --> 00:22.500
And where are
Applejack and Fluttershy?

00:22.650 --> 00:26.300
Fluttershy's detained helping Applejack
with a mishap at Sweet Apple Acres.

00:26.450 --> 00:27.380
They'll be along.

00:27.530 --> 00:30.160
I still don't get why
the Princess would be so late.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.270
She's bringing
an important visitor.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.710
That could be part of it.

00:33.860 --> 00:36.450
A visitor who's important and slow.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.430
Maybe it's somepony
so terribly important,

00:39.580 --> 00:42.600
she still had many more terribly important
things to do before she got here.

00:43.890 --> 00:47.900
Maybe the visitor has a deer antler,
a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail!

00:48.370 --> 00:50.200
Yeah, right. That's Discord.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.000
Why in the
wide-wide world of Equestria

00:52.150 --> 00:54.820
would Princess Celestia
bring along someone like that?

00:54.970 --> 00:57.320
Maybe you should ask her!

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000

01:48.720 --> 01:51.210
With all due respect,
Princess Celestia,

01:51.360 --> 01:53.920
how could you bring Discord here?!

01:55.300 --> 01:56.300
Your majesty.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.220
I'm fully aware that
the last time Discord was here,

01:59.370 --> 02:01.680
he created serious havoc.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.920
If by "serious havoc"
you mean

02:04.080 --> 02:06.860
"turning Ponyville into
the chaos capital of the world".

02:07.010 --> 02:09.720
And tricking us all into being
the opposite of our true selves.

02:09.870 --> 02:12.570
And making yummy delicious
chocolate milk rain all over the place,

02:12.720 --> 02:15.790
without a single dollop of whipped cream
to go with it anywhere in sight!

02:15.940 --> 02:17.910
Not a single dollop!

02:18.060 --> 02:20.200
Yes, I understand.

02:20.350 --> 02:22.100
But I have use for Discord's magic,

02:22.250 --> 02:25.550
if it can be reformed
to serve good instead of evil.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.000
This is why
I've brought Discord here,

02:28.150 --> 02:32.430
because I believe you are the ponies
who can help him do just that.

02:32.730 --> 02:34.550
This will never work!
This is a disaster!

02:34.700 --> 02:37.020
How will we control him?!
We're doomed!

02:37.170 --> 02:39.320
Need I remind you
that you are the ponies

02:39.470 --> 02:42.220
who turned him back into stone
like this in the first place?

02:42.720 --> 02:45.220
I suppose we can just use
the Elements of Harmony

02:45.370 --> 02:47.820
against him again
if he gets out of hand...

02:47.970 --> 02:49.910
We probably need a volunteer

02:50.070 --> 02:51.990
to run away from here
right away to get them.

02:52.140 --> 02:54.480
- I'll do it!
- No need, Spike.

02:54.630 --> 02:55.940
I have them right here.

02:56.090 --> 02:59.420
And I've cast a spell so Discord
can't take them and hide them again.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.070
Now where is Fluttershy?

03:03.220 --> 03:06.620
I believe she may know best
how to begin reforming Discord.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.820
Fluttershy? Really?

03:13.320 --> 03:16.120
- What's he goin' on about now?
- Good news.

03:16.270 --> 03:19.870
Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth has agreed
to take his dam apart and move it.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.550
Well, it's about time.

03:21.700 --> 03:25.650
My apple trees are so waterlogged
I can practically hear 'em gargle!

03:27.610 --> 03:30.570
But he says first you'll have
to apologize for calling him...

03:30.720 --> 03:31.950
"a nuisance".

03:32.100 --> 03:35.670
Apologize?!
He's lucky I didn't call him a varmint!

03:37.098 --> 03:40.580
Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth!
Such a language!

03:42.020 --> 03:43.320
Fine, fine.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.090
I apologize.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.170
Thanks, Fluttershy.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.970
Don't know what
I would've done without ya.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.290
Glad I could help.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.770
Hey, slackers!

04:02.920 --> 04:04.880
Double time it over to Ponyville,
would ya?

04:05.030 --> 04:06.230
We're all waiting on you!

04:09.630 --> 04:12.320
I realize that this is a tall order,

04:12.470 --> 04:14.270
but I wouldn't ask
if I weren't confident

04:14.420 --> 04:17.620
you could get him to use magic
obediently of his own free will.

04:17.770 --> 04:20.860
And you really think
I'll know best how to do that?

04:21.940 --> 04:23.080
I do.

04:25.410 --> 04:29.160
Now, I must return to Canterlot
for Equestria's royal summit.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.680
You may release Discord when ready.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.380
Okay, ponies,
guess it's time to get started.

04:41.530 --> 04:43.550
Let's just hope
this releasing spell works.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.940
Or... let's not.

04:45.090 --> 04:48.610
We'd best keep our elements on
at all times until further notice.

04:48.860 --> 04:49.860
Check!

05:28.350 --> 05:31.280
Well, it's about time somepony
got me out of that prison block.

05:31.630 --> 05:33.200
What a relief!

05:37.430 --> 05:38.690
What do you think you're doing?!

05:40.200 --> 05:42.870
Why, stretching of course.

05:43.020 --> 05:44.340
When you're a creature of chaos,

05:44.490 --> 05:48.320
stone bodysuits aren't
your typical go-to fashion choice.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.330
Make that bunny cute again! Now!

05:58.100 --> 06:01.120
He is adorable the way he is.

06:03.220 --> 06:04.770
You know what else is adorable?

06:04.920 --> 06:07.890
You ponies truly believe
that you can reform me,

06:08.040 --> 06:11.990
and that you're putting your faith
in this one here to make it happen.

06:12.140 --> 06:15.660
Makes me wanna pinch
your little horsey cheeks...

06:15.820 --> 06:17.000
How'd you know about that?!

06:17.140 --> 06:21.360
Being turned to stone doesn't keep me
from hearing every word Celestia says.

06:21.510 --> 06:24.990
Although I admit
it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.

06:26.630 --> 06:29.130
Well, unless you want us
to turn you back to stone,

06:29.280 --> 06:32.160
you'll zap those animals back
the way they were pronto!

06:32.310 --> 06:34.660
Oh, you wouldn't dare
turn me back to stone

06:34.820 --> 06:38.180
and risk disappointing
your precious princess.

06:38.330 --> 06:40.310
Try us, "Dip-cord"!

06:40.310 --> 06:42.700
You think you can treat
poor defenseless animals like that

06:42.850 --> 06:44.220
and get away with it?!

06:44.370 --> 06:45.920
You go, Fluttershy!

06:46.070 --> 06:51.060
You'd best watch your step, buster,
or I'll give you the Stare!

06:51.210 --> 06:54.030
The Stare?
Oh no, please, not that!

06:54.180 --> 06:56.930
Anything but
your disapproving eyeballs!

07:01.230 --> 07:03.580
Oh no! No no no, stop!

07:07.470 --> 07:09.970
Stop! I can't take it any more!

07:10.120 --> 07:14.710
I'll do whatever you say!
Because...

07:16.190 --> 07:18.820
You are hilarious!

07:19.390 --> 07:22.380
If it turns out we need to use
our elements against you,

07:22.530 --> 07:26.270
I'm sure we can convince Princess Celestia
it was for a good reason!

07:27.860 --> 07:29.770
I suppose that's correct.

07:42.470 --> 07:44.020
Oopsie!

07:44.170 --> 07:48.050
Well, it looks like I know
where I'll be crashing

07:48.200 --> 07:51.090
while I'm being "reformed"...

07:51.240 --> 07:53.730
With you, Fluttershy.

07:57.230 --> 07:58.340
Oh, dear.

08:02.890 --> 08:04.200
He may be horrible,

08:04.350 --> 08:05.770
but that doesn't mean
we have to act the same way.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.070
We should at least
try to be hospitable.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.060
You don't mind giving up
your favorite spot on the couch,

08:11.210 --> 08:12.790
do you, Angel Bunny?

08:15.890 --> 08:19.210
Oh, I'm sorry about Angel.
Are you alright?

08:19.360 --> 08:22.380
Oh, yes. Thank you,
Fluttershy, for your concern.

08:22.530 --> 08:25.480
If only your pony friends
could be as considerate...

08:25.630 --> 08:27.100
Don't listen to him, Fluttershy!

08:27.250 --> 08:30.130
He's just trying to drive a wedge
between us, like he always does.

08:30.280 --> 08:35.460
Now why in the world would
I ever try to do a thing like that?

08:35.610 --> 08:39.910
So we can't unite and use the Elements
of Harmony against you, that's why!

08:40.060 --> 08:42.300
I never thought of that...

08:42.450 --> 08:44.000
You big liar!

08:44.150 --> 08:45.730
Now, look who's a liar.

08:45.730 --> 08:49.340
Anyone can plainly see
that I'm not big at all.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.830
Oops.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.760
There, all better.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.280
I can't watch...

09:03.430 --> 09:04.990
We'll be outside.

09:06.990 --> 09:08.620
You sure you're okay with this?

09:08.770 --> 09:12.840
I know it's not gonna be easy,
but Princess Celestia's counting on me.

09:12.990 --> 09:15.600
And I think
I actually know what to do.

09:15.750 --> 09:16.340
You do?

09:16.490 --> 09:18.990
I think the key is to befriend him.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.760
Being kind to him and letting him
be my house guest

09:21.910 --> 09:23.790
is probably
the best way to do that.

09:23.940 --> 09:26.910
- And you really think that'll work?
- I think it's worth a try.

09:27.060 --> 09:30.760
Okay, but if you need us,
all you need to do is whisper "help",

09:30.910 --> 09:32.990
and we'll be back here
with our Elements.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.390
So watch that
goat-legged step of yours, pal!

09:37.410 --> 09:41.530
What?! Look at me!
I'm practically reformed already.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.740
She's really alright
with him staying there?

09:46.890 --> 09:47.970
That's what she said.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.490
Personally, I think we should
come up with a backup plan,

09:50.640 --> 09:53.580
in case this whole "befriending"
business doesn't work out.

09:53.730 --> 09:54.940
Rainbow Dash is right.

09:55.090 --> 09:56.880
This is Discord we're talking about,
girls.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.270
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to have another trick up our sleeves.

10:01.170 --> 10:03.600
And I think I know just the trick.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.350
Discord? Oh, there you are.

10:07.490 --> 10:10.450
Listen, Discord, I just want
to make sure you know that

10:10.450 --> 10:12.180
if there's anything I can do to--

10:13.560 --> 10:16.070
Are you eating... paper?

10:16.940 --> 10:19.890
Am I? How odd of me.

10:21.660 --> 10:23.300
Well, um...

10:23.450 --> 10:27.720
I'm just heading out, so,
make yourself at home while I'm gone.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.210
Bye-bye, have a nice time!

10:31.360 --> 10:35.010
Everything is fine here, bye bye...

10:36.800 --> 10:38.840
You like carrots, Angel?

10:39.440 --> 10:43.350
I'm playing your owner for a fool!

10:43.490 --> 10:45.370
How d'ya like them carrots?

10:52.140 --> 10:55.410
That's weird.
The spell I had in mind isn't in here.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.090
Spike, where are the other books
I asked you to pull?

10:58.240 --> 10:59.290
Right here, Twilight.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.420
I really want to have a
reforming spell up and running pronto.

11:02.570 --> 11:04.440
But what if he makes the
Elements of Harmony disappear

11:04.590 --> 11:05.830
like he did last time?

11:05.980 --> 11:08.960
Princess Celestia cast a spell
protecting them, remember?

11:10.590 --> 11:11.200
What's wrong?

11:11.350 --> 11:14.490
Princess Celestia didn't cast a spell
protecting our books!

11:14.640 --> 11:17.000
Everywhere I thought
I'd find the reforming spell...

11:22.220 --> 11:24.550
Are you sure
this isn't overdoing?

11:24.700 --> 11:26.790
You said to make myself at home
while you were gone,

11:26.940 --> 11:29.560
but I wouldn't want
to overstep my bounds.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.540
I did say that, so...

11:32.690 --> 11:37.060
if this makes you more comfortable,
by all means, please feel free.

11:37.210 --> 11:39.190
Well, it does, very much so.

11:39.340 --> 11:43.240
You're so very kind,
my dear Fluttershy.

11:43.390 --> 11:45.790
I always knew that you were
the understanding one,

11:45.940 --> 11:48.650
not like those nasty friends of yours.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.000
My friends aren't nasty!

11:51.150 --> 11:52.930
Of course you'd say that,

11:53.080 --> 11:56.190
it just goes to show
how understanding you truly are.

11:57.330 --> 12:00.940
You know,
I think Princess Celestia is right

12:01.090 --> 12:04.300
when she singles you out
as the one who could reform me.

12:04.450 --> 12:08.100
You're off to such a good start
I'm seriously considering actually

12:08.250 --> 12:10.070
being reformed.

12:10.540 --> 12:13.340
Fluttershy!
Fluttershy, can you hear me?!

12:13.490 --> 12:15.440
Goodness! I hear Twilight!

12:19.330 --> 12:21.980
Fluttershy, what's going on?
Are you okay?!

12:22.130 --> 12:26.160
We're fine, everything's going great.
Isn't it, Angel?

12:29.350 --> 12:31.300
We've come to get you away
from Discord!

12:31.450 --> 12:33.490
He's just terrible and,
from the looks of it,

12:33.640 --> 12:35.220
completely out of control!

12:35.370 --> 12:39.090
Oh, but you're wrong!
We're making great progress!

12:39.540 --> 12:40.930
Seriously?!

12:41.080 --> 12:44.900
I'm earning his trust by giving him
a little space to be himself.

12:45.050 --> 12:48.500
Hate to break it to you,
but he used that "space to be himself"

12:48.650 --> 12:50.850
to tear out all the reforming spells
from the library!

12:51.000 --> 12:53.850
That does explain the paper eating...

12:54.000 --> 12:55.920
He ate them?!

12:57.300 --> 12:59.100
But we aren't gonna need a spell.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.740
He's already really
considering being reformed!

13:01.890 --> 13:02.870
He said so.

13:03.020 --> 13:04.330
And you believed him?!

13:04.480 --> 13:07.340
If I'm going to be his friend,
I have to start by giving him

13:07.490 --> 13:08.540
the benefit of the doubt!

13:08.690 --> 13:12.120
Tell you what. Bring all the ponies over
for a dinner party this evening,

13:12.270 --> 13:15.340
and I bet his manners
will have really improved by then.

13:16.990 --> 13:20.420
I'll even get him to put the cottage
back on the ground first.

13:21.930 --> 13:23.840
Alright. Dinner it is...

13:26.890 --> 13:30.530
I can't believe we're having
a dinner party with Discord!

13:30.680 --> 13:32.890
This evening
is sure to be a disaster.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.520
Glad I didn't bother wearing
my fanciest outfit.

13:35.670 --> 13:38.190
Fluttershy thinks this is the way
to reform Discord

13:38.340 --> 13:39.990
and asked us
to give it a chance.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.840
Oh, our pony guests!

13:44.910 --> 13:47.750
We're so delighted
that you've come.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.530
Please, do come in.

13:53.550 --> 13:56.330
See what a beautiful job
he did helping?

13:56.470 --> 13:59.240
Discord set the entire table himself.

13:59.390 --> 14:00.850
I'm so proud.

14:01.890 --> 14:06.720
May I take your...
hats, ladies?

14:06.870 --> 14:10.840
Hang on to your elements, girls.
It's gonna be a bumpy night.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.790
As you all know,
Princess Celestia hoped

14:14.940 --> 14:18.030
we'd help Discord use his magic
for good, instead of evil.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.900
Pinkie Pie, care for some gravy?

14:22.050 --> 14:22.870
You bet!

14:23.010 --> 14:24.790
Allow me.

14:28.180 --> 14:30.840
Oh, what a cute little
gravy boat you are!

14:30.990 --> 14:33.270
Yes you are! Yes you are!

14:34.340 --> 14:37.880
That's one creepy little
gravy boat if you ask me.

14:38.030 --> 14:41.710
Oh, come on now, Dashie,
you're not even giving this a chance.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.550
Hey! That's hot!

14:44.700 --> 14:47.210
Whoops! I'm so sorry!

14:47.360 --> 14:48.770
He did that on purpose!

14:48.920 --> 14:52.190
I don't know about that.
Mistakes happen.

14:52.340 --> 14:56.230
Oh, look, everypony,
dancing candles!

14:58.790 --> 15:00.630
I'm not falling for that!

15:00.780 --> 15:03.290
Discord's just trying
to distract us from--

15:04.690 --> 15:06.540
Hey! Knock it off!

15:06.690 --> 15:08.410
I suppose that's another "mistake"?

15:08.560 --> 15:11.360
No, I think you just made them mad.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.430
There's something fishy going on.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.180
Discord!

15:17.330 --> 15:19.430
Well it's hardly my fault
if the soup tureen

15:19.590 --> 15:23.380
finds the term "something fishy"
to be offensive.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.400
Not the dress. Not the dress!

15:25.540 --> 15:28.060
That tureen's only doin'
what you're makin' it do!

15:28.210 --> 15:30.780
Now let's not jump
to any conclusions.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.870
Fluttershy,
can't you see what he's doing?

15:34.020 --> 15:36.490
He's playing innocent with you
so you'll never agree to use

15:36.640 --> 15:38.860
the Elements of Harmony
against him!

15:39.390 --> 15:42.700
Well, that's a bit harsh,
isn't it?

15:44.390 --> 15:46.820
You see what I'm saying,
right, Fluttershy?

15:47.350 --> 15:48.500
Fluttershy!

15:48.650 --> 15:49.790
You know what I see?

15:49.940 --> 15:52.200
I see that
Discord's far from perfect,

15:52.350 --> 15:54.910
but I also see none of you
giving him a chance!

15:55.790 --> 15:57.350
What's gotten into you?!

15:57.490 --> 15:59.540
Why do you keep cutting him
so much slack?!

16:00.500 --> 16:03.270
Because that's what friends do.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.840
We're friends?

16:05.990 --> 16:07.240
Why, of course!

16:07.390 --> 16:11.340
I can't ever remember my house being
this lively before you came along.

16:11.920 --> 16:16.340
Oh. Well, I've...
never really had a friend before.

16:16.490 --> 16:18.140
Well now you do!

16:23.490 --> 16:27.200
Now is not a good time, Angel.
We're having a dinner party.

16:27.350 --> 16:30.110
Hold up! I think he's tryin'
to tell us somethin'!

16:32.390 --> 16:33.490
Apple!

16:33.830 --> 16:35.040
Applejack!

16:39.800 --> 16:41.740
Sweet Apple Acres?

16:42.320 --> 16:44.440
Flooding at Sweet Apple Acres!

16:44.590 --> 16:46.920
And we all know who's
behind that now, don't we?!

16:47.070 --> 16:49.420
Who, me?

16:49.570 --> 16:51.000
Oh, give it a rest!

16:51.150 --> 16:54.380
What do you think of your
"friend" now, Fluttershy?

17:00.550 --> 17:02.490
I've never seen
the floodin' this bad!

17:02.800 --> 17:06.020
They've built dams round here before,
but never like this!

17:06.170 --> 17:07.750
What's goin' on?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.790
Such language!

17:11.630 --> 17:14.840
It's no use.
They won't listen to a word I say!

17:14.990 --> 17:17.290
You see Discord's
behind all this, right?

17:17.440 --> 17:19.150
Oh, of course I do!

17:19.300 --> 17:21.640
Do you all think I'm a silly,
gullible fool?!

17:25.490 --> 17:28.400
I've just been trying to gain
his friendship any way I can,

17:28.550 --> 17:31.000
so he'd come to trust
and listen to me!

17:31.150 --> 17:35.050
Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn?
The water's great!

17:35.950 --> 17:37.500
Time to see if it worked.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.550
Fluttershy, there you are.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.490
A sight for sore eyes.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.670
As you can see, there's a big mess
down here at Sweet Apple Acres.

17:46.820 --> 17:49.200
Oh, yes. Awful business, that.

17:49.970 --> 17:51.550
It is awful.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.200
This is Applejack's home,
and it's being destroyed

17:54.350 --> 17:56.800
by innocent creatures
who would never be acting this way

17:56.950 --> 17:59.670
if it weren't for
your reckless behavior.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.100
You need to fix this.

18:03.110 --> 18:08.050
Very well, I will fix it.
I only ask one thing in return.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.000
Yes?

18:09.150 --> 18:13.180
I ask that you never use
your Element of Harmony against me.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.160
As a sign of our friendship.

18:21.140 --> 18:24.370
I will never use
my Element of Harmony against you.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.140
Excellent!

18:29.490 --> 18:32.050
There, much better!

18:32.200 --> 18:37.350
I do prefer ice skating
to water skiing! Don't you?

18:39.690 --> 18:41.020
Discord!

18:41.270 --> 18:43.270
That's not fixing it!

18:44.600 --> 18:46.190
Why, I oughta...

18:46.700 --> 18:48.070
Where are you going?

18:49.190 --> 18:52.560
- What's wrong, pal?
- Don't call me your pal!

18:53.640 --> 18:57.900
Come skating with me,
and we'll let bygones be bygones.

19:01.330 --> 19:03.380
Here you go, Fluttershy!
Game on!

19:03.530 --> 19:06.120
He fixes this or
he goes back to being stone!

19:06.270 --> 19:08.510
Princess Celestia will understand!

19:13.630 --> 19:16.000
I made a promise not to use
my element against him

19:16.150 --> 19:17.550
and I'm going to keep it.

19:23.150 --> 19:24.380
You see?

19:24.530 --> 19:27.320
She wants to have fun with me
because we're friends.

19:27.470 --> 19:30.810
She can't use the elements against me
because we're friends.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.330
I'm free forever!

19:35.670 --> 19:39.060
Not. Your. Friend!

19:39.210 --> 19:40.550
Who cares?

19:40.700 --> 19:43.100
I can do whatever I want,
whenever I want.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.610
I'm Discord, the master of chaos!

19:47.450 --> 19:49.510
You think
you can boss Discord around?

19:49.660 --> 19:54.050
You think I'm just going to
turn all this back because you say so?

19:54.200 --> 19:58.390
Because if I don't
I'll lose the one friend I ever had?

20:06.620 --> 20:08.450
Well played, Fluttershy.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.610
Well played.

20:29.270 --> 20:32.530
I liked it better my way, but...
I guess when you're friends,

20:32.680 --> 20:36.600
you can't always have things
exactly your way all the time, eh?

20:40.450 --> 20:42.920
Yes, Princess,
I'm ready to use my magic

20:43.070 --> 20:45.710
for good instead of evil.

20:45.860 --> 20:47.320
Most of the time.

20:47.470 --> 20:50.050
Congratulations on your success,
ponies.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.570
I definitely sense
a big change in Discord.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.050
I'll leave the Elements of Harmony
with you, Twilight.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.970
Just in case.

21:00.410 --> 21:02.510
You were right
when you said Fluttershy

21:02.660 --> 21:05.330
would be the one to find
the way to reform Discord.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.130
By treating Discord as a friend,

21:07.280 --> 21:09.240
she got him to realize
that friendship

21:09.390 --> 21:11.420
was actually important to him.

21:11.570 --> 21:15.010
And something that, once he had,
he didn't want to lose.

21:15.580 --> 21:18.300
Go on. Say it...

21:19.560 --> 21:21.780
Alright...
Friendship is magic!

21:24.430 --> 21:27.670
See?
He can be a real sweetheart

21:27.820 --> 21:29.510
once you get to know him.
