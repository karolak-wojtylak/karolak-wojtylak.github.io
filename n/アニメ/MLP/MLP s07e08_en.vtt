WEBVTT

00:05.272 --> 00:06.070
Hey, Apple Bloom!

00:06.672 --> 00:09.275
Rarity's re-organizing her
shop and look what she found!

00:10.077 --> 00:12.277
Old costumes from
the talent show!

00:14.481 --> 00:16.015
We thought they'd come in handy

00:16.117 --> 00:17.917
in case we ever help
a pony put on a play

00:18.119 --> 00:20.619
or need to make a quick
escape disguised as clowns!

00:24.757 --> 00:25.857
Here you go, Big Mac.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.769
Whoa! That sure is
a lot of apples!

00:30.264 --> 00:32.564
Are you making another delivery
to Starlight's old village?

00:32.900 --> 00:33.698
Eee-yup.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.736
That's an awful long way
for a pony to go, isn't it?

00:37.138 --> 00:37.936
Eee-yup.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.736
You've been going
there a lot lately.

00:39.838 --> 00:41.508
What is this? Your
fifth trip this week?

00:44.378 --> 00:45.244
Eee-yup.

00:45.446 --> 00:46.946
OK, well, have fun!

00:47.448 --> 00:49.815
So what other costumes did
you bring, Sweetie Belle?

00:50.117 --> 00:51.515
Are you crazy!?

00:51.617 --> 00:54.417
We can't talk about costumes
at a time like this!

00:54.688 --> 00:55.888
Time like what?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.724
Your brother is
hiding something.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.160
Did you see the
way he was acting?

01:01.462 --> 01:03.963
Yeah, he totally blushed
when you brought up

01:04.065 --> 01:06.265
how often he's been going
to Starlight's old village.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.268
Something is
definitely going on.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.170
There can only be one reason

01:11.272 --> 01:14.640
a pony would travel
so far, so often.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.841
Scootaloo: He's taking private skiing lessons!
Apple Bloom: I've been cooking a lot of broccoli-
Sweetie Belle: He's training for a marathon!

01:16.943 --> 01:18.846
-and he wants to get
away from the smell!

02:04.892 --> 02:09.061
Maybe he's a spy on a mission
to thwart an evil villain

02:09.163 --> 02:10.362
with his secret weapon:

02:10.664 --> 02:12.164
an apple cannon!

02:12.766 --> 02:16.302
No, that's crazy. I think
it's my broccoli thing.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.004
Why don't we just
ask him?

02:18.506 --> 02:21.040
You saw how shifty he
was acting earlier.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.442
There's no way he'll
tell us what he's doing.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.211
Plus, I really want
to go undercover.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.847
We already
have costumes.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.284
Call me: Agent Rainbowhead.

02:31.986 --> 02:35.020
I'll be Shimmering Spectacles:

02:35.422 --> 02:38.558
a librarian with
a mysterious past.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.994
And I'll be a pirate
spy. Argh. A spyrate!

02:48.301 --> 02:50.469
Avast! Our ship be leaving port!

02:50.871 --> 02:51.669
Huh?

02:51.771 --> 02:52.805
Big Mac's leaving.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.276
If we're gonna be
spies, we gotta go NOW!

03:08.222 --> 03:10.589
Big Mac's comin'!
Quick, act like apples!

03:10.891 --> 03:12.157
What? How?

03:28.409 --> 03:29.641
Who's that pony?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.010
Let me see!

03:35.448 --> 03:37.916
I don't know. Shouldn't
have taken the binoculars.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.868
I don't know
anypony here.

03:40.221 --> 03:41.487
That must be
Sugar Belle.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.655
Applejack told me
about her bakery.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.258
Obviously, she's just been
ordering a lot of apples.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.232
So nothing fishy's
going on.

03:53.434 --> 03:56.502
No way! We came
here to be spies!

03:56.604 --> 03:59.872
And no spy I know has ever
solved a case that quick.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.174
Um..how many spies
do you know?

04:02.376 --> 04:04.043
That's.. not important.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.047
What's important is
that we do more recon!

04:08.449 --> 04:09.348
Follow my lead.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.561
Whoa, she sure likes her apples!

04:22.963 --> 04:26.499
What is she doing? Making the
biggest apple pie in Equestria?

04:27.201 --> 04:29.735
Thanks for coming all
this way, Big Mac.

04:32.705 --> 04:35.374
It sure is nice seeing
you again so soon.

04:38.646 --> 04:39.413
Eee-yup.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.116
All I used to bake were
boring old muffins.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.185
But thanks to your
apple deliveries,

04:46.287 --> 04:48.654
I get to bake all kinds
of delicious treats!

04:48.756 --> 04:51.690
... apple pies, apple
fritters, apple turnovers,

04:51.792 --> 04:54.526
caramel apples,
caramel apple cakes...

04:55.728 --> 04:58.778
I just wish I had more
room to display it all.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.433
My shelves only hold so much.

05:02.403 --> 05:06.005
I'm telling you, this pony
reaaaally likes her apples!

05:06.607 --> 05:08.957
Or Big Mac!

05:09.209 --> 05:09.741
Huh?

05:10.043 --> 05:10.976
Just look!

05:11.578 --> 05:12.811
Ooh! Uh!

05:16.517 --> 05:18.918
Sweetie Belle, I
think you're right!

05:19.320 --> 05:21.220
I think my brother has a crush!

05:21.422 --> 05:22.087
Shhhh!

05:27.327 --> 05:28.727
Psst! Big Mac!

05:31.731 --> 05:34.499
Now remember, my
brother's super shy

05:34.601 --> 05:37.369
so he's probably going to be
embarrassed about his crush.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.338
Just try and make
him feel comfortable.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.709
Hey, Big Mac! It's
me: Apple Bloom!

05:44.211 --> 05:45.377
Eee-yup.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.779
We're here, too!

05:47.081 --> 05:48.247
Mm hm.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.151
I'm going to ask you a
very personal question

05:52.553 --> 05:55.020
and I want you to
answer honestly.

05:56.923 --> 06:01.160
Do you... have a crush
on... Sugar Belle?

06:01.462 --> 06:02.595
Eee-yup.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.463
Well, that was easy!

06:04.665 --> 06:05.898
This is so exciting!

06:06.100 --> 06:08.767
My big brother has
his very first crush!

06:08.969 --> 06:11.770
First crush? What
about Cheerilee?

06:12.172 --> 06:14.039
It doesn't really count
when you trick a pony

06:14.141 --> 06:16.475
into drinking a love
potion, does it?

06:16.777 --> 06:17.643
Nope.

06:17.845 --> 06:21.246
My brother has a crush!
My brother has a crush!

06:21.548 --> 06:23.249
My brother has a crush!

06:23.751 --> 06:26.118
Wait. Does Sugar Belle
even know you like her?

06:26.320 --> 06:27.119
Nuh uh.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.321
Then you gotta
tell her!

06:30.023 --> 06:32.124
Ehh....

06:32.426 --> 06:34.259
We're pretty sure
she likes you!

06:34.461 --> 06:36.161
I mean, she keeps
ordering apples

06:36.263 --> 06:37.596
just so she can
see you again!

06:37.798 --> 06:39.398
Ya think so?

06:39.700 --> 06:42.835
Totally. But you'll never
know if you don't try!

06:43.837 --> 06:44.803
OK.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.607
Go get 'er, Big Mac!

07:02.790 --> 07:06.124
Hey girl. I was writing
poetry by the pond

07:06.226 --> 07:07.626
when I saw these flowers.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.962
I thought I'd show them
how pretty you are.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.764
Oh. Thanks,
Feather Bangs!

07:18.905 --> 07:22.241
Um, is it possible to
have two crushes at once?

07:22.543 --> 07:26.111
Because it looks like Big
Mac may not be the only pony

07:26.213 --> 07:27.646
Sugar Belle likes!

07:34.588 --> 07:36.922
Hey, Big Mac! Where you goin'?

07:37.624 --> 07:38.222
Home.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.359
You can't let that Feather
fella get in the way

07:40.561 --> 07:41.693
of your one true love.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.528
You've gotta take him down!

07:43.830 --> 07:45.530
What can he do that you can't?

07:45.632 --> 07:46.230
That!

07:46.532 --> 07:49.534
Whoops! Ha ha. These
balls are like you.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.970
I'll always catch
you if you fall.

07:55.107 --> 07:57.342
Seriously? That line worked?

07:57.744 --> 07:59.444
She'll never pick me.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.414
Sure she will, cause
we're gonna help you!

08:02.616 --> 08:04.616
No love potions!

08:08.054 --> 08:11.590
Don't worry, Big Mac. We learned
our lesson the hard way.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.359
Yeah, we're never
gonna do that again.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.428
Besides, I know
exactly what to do!

08:16.730 --> 08:19.598
When I was younger I
read all the fairy tales.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.666
When you were
younger, huh?

08:21.768 --> 08:24.504
Well.. I was younger
on the way here.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.139
It was a long ride!

08:27.841 --> 08:30.142
Anyway, as long as we
do what the book says,

08:30.244 --> 08:32.277
you're pretty much
guaranteed a happy ending!

08:34.847 --> 08:36.046
How 'bout this one?!

08:36.448 --> 08:40.252
Rescuing a damsel pony in
distress. That's perfect.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.322
Of course, we'll have to
improvise without a dragon.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.858
Too bad Spike isn't here. Not
that he's very threatening.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.962
So what should we do?

08:51.164 --> 08:52.914
Wait around for Sugar
Belle to get herself

08:53.100 --> 08:54.334
into a scary situation?

08:54.802 --> 08:58.003
OR we bring the danger to her!

09:04.243 --> 09:06.745
All right, Scootaloo's
gonna pretend to take

09:06.847 --> 09:10.615
Sugar Belle's things, then you
swoop in and stop her. Ready?

09:12.384 --> 09:13.219
Nope.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.888
C'mon, you're gonna be her hero!

09:17.190 --> 09:19.458
In fairy tales, the
knight in shining armor

09:19.560 --> 09:20.992
always gets the girl.

09:23.016 --> 09:23.516
Uh-huh

09:32.672 --> 09:35.139
Oh! Somepony help!

09:48.087 --> 09:53.358
Here's your sugar, Sugar. Though
it is not as sweet... as you.

09:58.498 --> 09:59.898
Thank you, Feather!

10:01.767 --> 10:04.303
That smooth-talking
pony stole our rescue!

10:04.605 --> 10:05.937
And it totally
would have worked!

10:06.139 --> 10:07.039
Eeyup!

10:07.341 --> 10:09.108
We're just gonna
have to keep trying!

10:09.610 --> 10:12.110
Big Mac, are you ready
to take it up a notch?

10:12.512 --> 10:13.845
Oh, Eeyup!

10:15.815 --> 10:16.916
Oh, Nope.

10:17.518 --> 10:21.019
Trust us. There's nothing
more romantic than waking

10:21.121 --> 10:22.921
your special pony
from a sleeping spell

10:23.023 --> 10:24.423
with a magical kiss!

10:25.425 --> 10:28.360
See? They rode off
into the sunset.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.197
Any sign of Feather Bangs?

10:37.169 --> 10:39.304
Negative. Coast is clear!

10:39.806 --> 10:41.407
It's now or never, Big Mac!

11:00.893 --> 11:01.361
Ah!

11:03.663 --> 11:06.698
Oh, girl, you've been
workin' hard all day.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.802
Allow me to treat you
like the princess, heh heh, you are!

11:15.976 --> 11:20.178
Hey! That's our metaphorical
sunset they're riding off into!

11:20.380 --> 11:23.048
All right. This ends now!

11:23.250 --> 11:25.450
Feather Bangs may
have good timing.

11:25.752 --> 11:29.555
And a good mane. But let's
see him compete with a song!

11:30.157 --> 11:31.523
Say what now?!

11:32.025 --> 11:34.726
Of course! Why didn't
we think of it before?

11:35.128 --> 11:38.697
Every great love story hinges
on the romantic musical number!

11:39.099 --> 11:42.033
Big Mac, you've gotta write
a song for Sugar Belle!

11:42.635 --> 11:43.402
Ee-yup!

11:50.944 --> 11:52.377
Come on, Big Mac!

11:52.779 --> 11:56.048
Feather Bangs is
so romantic

11:56.450 --> 11:59.651
When he speaks, I pretend
he's talking to me.

12:01.420 --> 12:05.257
Come on! You can do better than
him! Just like we practiced.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.068
What in Equestria has
gotten into you two!?

15:37.570 --> 15:39.203
If you think I'm
the kind of pony

15:39.305 --> 15:40.705
that likes all
this nonsense,

15:40.807 --> 15:43.442
then you clearly
don't know me at all!

15:43.944 --> 15:47.779
I wish everypony would
just LEAVE ME ALONE!

16:08.968 --> 16:10.135
Big Mac!

16:14.005 --> 16:15.140
Big Mac!

16:15.342 --> 16:18.043
Well, nopony's seen him.

16:18.545 --> 16:23.248
I feel terrible. I've never seen
my brother so upset before.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.717
BIG MAC! Big Mac!

16:31.223 --> 16:32.457
Are you OK?

16:32.959 --> 16:33.659
Nope.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.762
Sorry it didn't work
out with Sugar Belle.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.297
We don't get it.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.467
Big, grand gestures always
work in the fairy tales!

16:43.169 --> 16:46.137
But Sugar Belle's not
a fairy tale princess;

16:46.639 --> 16:48.039
she's a real pony.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.575
She's kind and she works hard

16:50.677 --> 16:53.077
and she's sweeter than
everything in her bakery.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.349
That's it! We should
have been thinking about

16:58.451 --> 17:00.585
what would mean a
lot to Sugar Belle!

17:01.187 --> 17:01.853
Hmmm.

17:04.024 --> 17:07.325
I know just the thing! But
I'm gonna need your help.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.195
Really? Even after
we messed it up?

17:10.497 --> 17:12.030
Eee-yup!

17:12.154 --> 17:12.831
C'mon!

17:23.276 --> 17:27.545
Hello! My name's
Shimmering Spectacles

17:27.747 --> 17:32.017
and I'm a librarian
with a mysterious past.

17:32.519 --> 17:38.089
Oh. OK. I'm--wait a
minute. You look familiar.

17:38.591 --> 17:45.063
I shouldn't. Um... I'm new in
town. Mind showing me around?

17:45.465 --> 17:46.231
Uh, sure.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.401
That's the whole town.
It's just the one street.

17:56.176 --> 18:01.412
Oh, no, clumsy me! Here,
let me help you clean it up!

18:03.682 --> 18:06.250
I don't think Scootaloo can
hold her off much longer!

18:08.654 --> 18:11.022
Uh... now hold on
a minute.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.826
Are you sure I
can't buy you a new bag?

18:15.228 --> 18:17.528
I'm good. It's no big deal.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.330
But... uh... um...

18:24.269 --> 18:27.039
OK, what's going on?

18:28.141 --> 18:31.876
The cupcake has landed! Repeat!
The cupcake has landed!

18:34.613 --> 18:35.747
Big Mac!

18:40.520 --> 18:43.054
You made me a new display case?

18:43.356 --> 18:44.789
Eee-yup...

18:45.291 --> 18:48.293
And you made it bigger!
You remembered!

18:49.195 --> 18:52.030
Now I have twice as much
room for all my desserts.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.534
Which means...
I can make even more!

18:56.536 --> 18:59.504
I've been dying to try baking
cream pies and whoopie pies

18:59.606 --> 19:03.675
and icebox cakes and of
course, more apple treats.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.579
Oh, Big Mac, thank
you so much.

19:07.881 --> 19:11.783
This is the sweetest thing
anypony's ever done for me.

19:11.885 --> 19:17.556
Ummm... yee-- nooope... uh...

19:17.958 --> 19:20.158
I like you, too.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.663
Awwwwwwww!

19:25.765 --> 19:28.066
That was the most
romantic thing ever!

19:28.768 --> 19:32.704
Wait a minute...
I recognize you fillies!

19:32.906 --> 19:35.173
Have they been with
you this whole time?

19:36.475 --> 19:38.242
I'm Big Mac's little sister.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.011
And these are my friends.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.413
We're sorry for everything
we put you through today,

19:42.515 --> 19:43.213
Sugar Belle.

19:43.715 --> 19:46.484
Big Mac never would have gone
through with all of those crazy

19:46.886 --> 19:47.718
Over-the-top...

19:48.120 --> 19:49.618
Downright ridiculous...

19:49.720 --> 19:52.490
attempts to impress you if
we hadn't put him up to it.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.526
But we learned our lesson!

19:55.228 --> 19:57.595
Romance isn't about
impressing somepony;

19:57.897 --> 20:00.565
it's about doing something
that means something special

20:00.667 --> 20:04.502
to that pony you lo--
like a lot.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.472
Uh, Apple Bloom? I
think they get it.

20:12.645 --> 20:23.523
<i> ♪ Sugar Belle!! Whoa!</i>
<i> Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! ♪</i>

20:23.647 --> 20:24.724
<i> ♪ Yeah..  ♪</i>

20:25.625 --> 20:29.260
Sorry, Feather. You're
a little too late.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.697
Yeah, Sugar Belle's already
picked her special somepony.

20:36.468 --> 20:37.467
But don't worry.

20:37.769 --> 20:40.938
You've got three not-so-secret
admirers right behind you!

20:45.686 --> 20:46.386
Heh, heh..

20:46.911 --> 20:48.046
What should I say to them?

20:48.548 --> 20:50.715
Uh. You're asking us for advice?

20:50.917 --> 20:54.886
Uh huh. Look, I can mane-flip,
write poetry and juggle,

20:54.988 --> 20:56.855
but actually talking to a pony?

20:57.657 --> 20:59.858
It scares me almost
as much as loneliness.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.027
Will you help me? Please?

21:03.529 --> 21:05.763
Gee, I don't know about this.

21:05.965 --> 21:09.033
He just needs a little nudge in
the conversation department!

21:09.235 --> 21:12.870
Besides, I don't think Big
Mac's ready to leave just yet.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.009
Let's do it!

21:18.811 --> 21:23.013
Feather Bangs, the Cutie Mark
Crusaders are AT YOUR SERVICE!
