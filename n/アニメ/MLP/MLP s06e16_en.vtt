WEBVTT

00:04.940 --> 00:06.840
I hope Shining Armor
and Princess Cadance

00:06.880 --> 00:07.980
don't think it's too
soon for me

00:08.020 --> 00:10.070
to come back to the Crystal
Empire for a visit.

00:10.360 --> 00:12.540
But I just know Flurry Heart's
grown so much already.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.360
I wonder if I'll
even recognize her.

00:15.260 --> 00:17.440
She's the only baby
they have, Twilight.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.110
I think it'll be pretty easy
to figure out who she is.

00:20.860 --> 00:21.460
Mm.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.420
Sorry, I know you want to visit
your niece as much as possible

00:25.460 --> 00:27.220
and I'm excited to
see Sunburst again.

00:27.640 --> 00:28.940
I just don't want
to fall behind

00:28.980 --> 00:31.060
on my friendship
lessons back home.

00:31.280 --> 00:34.400
Starlight, your work in
Ponyville isn't going anywhere.

00:34.740 --> 00:37.100
Besides, I think we
all know you can learn

00:37.140 --> 00:39.100
about friendship
anywhere, right Spike?

00:40.640 --> 00:42.920
Spike? Who's Spike?

00:43.640 --> 00:46.740
Uh you're
Spike, Spike.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.110
And why are you
dressed like that?

00:49.720 --> 00:51.320
Guys! You're blowing my cover.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.780
How'd you even
know it was me?

00:54.120 --> 00:58.300
Because you're YOU-- in
a coat, hat, and glasses.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.240
Also, we're the
only ones here.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.460
Right.

01:03.060 --> 01:05.280
Spike, why do you
need a disguise?

01:05.760 --> 01:07.560
The last time we came
to the Crystal Empire.

01:07.660 --> 01:09.420
there was a lot going
on with the new baby

01:09.460 --> 01:10.320
and the Crystalling,

01:10.400 --> 01:12.040
but I still got
mobbed in the street.

01:13.020 --> 01:15.120
I wouldn't say "mobbed."

01:15.680 --> 01:17.740
And this is just
a family visit.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.360
I wouldn't want the presence of
"Spike the Brave and Glorious"

01:20.480 --> 01:22.380
to turn it into
some kind of circus.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.380
We get it. The Crystal
Ponies adore you.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.260
He did save the
Empire. Twice.

01:29.060 --> 01:31.260
But still, I don't
think your presence

01:31.300 --> 01:33.060
will turn our visit
into a circus.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.140
Not if I find the right
disguise, it won't.

01:46.620 --> 01:53.520

We have crystal muffins!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

02:20.160 --> 02:24.000
Uh disguise or not, Spike, I
don't think you need to worry

02:24.040 --> 02:27.140
about being mobbed.
Nopony's here.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.480
It's like a ghost town.

02:31.060 --> 02:33.660
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.180
Yeah, this is weird.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.940
I guess I don't need
the disguise after all.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.260
It's Spike, the
Brave and Glorious!

02:50.700 --> 02:53.200
He's come to save
us yet again!

02:53.500 --> 02:55.780
Spike! Spike! Spike!

02:55.960 --> 02:57.100
Save you from what?

02:57.860 --> 02:59.300
Yeah. What's going on?

02:59.460 --> 03:01.000
Why was everypony hiding?

03:01.940 --> 03:05.040
It sure looks like Princess
Twilight and her pupil.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.380
But how can we be sure?

03:07.720 --> 03:11.560
We can't. Either one of them
could be the-- you know.

03:14.380 --> 03:19.320
What if this isn't
the real Spike!?

03:19.720 --> 03:21.180
EVERYPONY RUN!

03:22.540 --> 03:23.360
Awww!

03:25.000 --> 03:28.160
OK. Something strange
is definitely going on.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.640
Ugh, you think?

03:34.840 --> 03:35.780
Who goes there?

03:36.060 --> 03:39.340
Um... you don't recognize
the Princess of Friendship?

03:39.980 --> 03:41.500
Of course we recognize her.

03:41.820 --> 03:44.060
But that doesn't
mean it's really her.

03:45.700 --> 03:48.200
It's OK, guys.
They're with me.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.500
And any friend of Spike
the Brave and Glorious

03:50.560 --> 03:53.600
is a friend of the Crystal
Empire, am I right?

03:55.220 --> 03:58.160
Huh. It does look like him.

03:58.380 --> 03:59.960
Well, it would, wouldn't it?

04:00.200 --> 04:02.800
I'm sorry, but we'll need to see
some proof of identification.

04:03.380 --> 04:05.340
<i> We'll take care of</i>
<i> things from here.</i>

04:07.320 --> 04:10.710
Oh Cadance, thank
goodness! What's going on?

04:11.340 --> 04:15.240
We can explain, Twilly
if it really is you.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.960
"Sunshine, Sunshine--"

04:20.080 --> 04:24.200
"--Lady bugs awake! Clap your
hooves and do a little shake!"

04:26.180 --> 04:28.780
It's OK, everypony.
It's her.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.420
Of course it's her.
What's all this about?

04:35.640 --> 04:37.760
A Changeling's been
spotted nearby.

04:38.020 --> 04:39.220
A Changeling!?

04:39.260 --> 04:40.160
That's not good.

04:40.260 --> 04:41.580
No. It's not.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.180
After Queen Chrysalis took
my place at our wedding

04:44.220 --> 04:46.400
and invaded Canterlot
with her army of minions,

04:46.760 --> 04:48.820
we're not taking any chances.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.900
Changelings feed off of love,

04:51.120 --> 04:52.840
and ever since Flurry
Heart's Crystalling,

04:52.900 --> 04:56.180
the Empire is filled with more
love than anywhere in Equestria.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.300
It's possible they've
come for the baby.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.060
That's why we've posted the
extra guards and why we're--

05:02.120 --> 05:03.460
--checking
everypony's identity.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.280
I'm sorry for all of this.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.980
Flurry Heart's really been
looking forward to seeing you.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.120
Oh! She's gotten so big!

05:14.460 --> 05:17.180
Starlight and I will do whatever
we can to help protect her.

05:18.160 --> 05:22.050
To be honest, having you
here is already a big relief.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.980
The Royal Guards were
wondering if Spike,

05:28.020 --> 05:29.120
the Brave and Glorious,

05:29.260 --> 05:31.220
would like to join in the
search for the Changeling.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.730
Really?

05:33.380 --> 05:35.760
Uh, I don't know if that's
such a good idea, Spike.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.480
It sounds dangerous.

05:37.820 --> 05:40.620
Come on, Twilight. This is
Spike the Brave and Glorious

05:40.680 --> 05:44.160
you're talking to. Have you ever
known me to run from danger?

05:44.640 --> 05:45.780
Ummmm...

05:46.120 --> 05:47.700
He'll be safe with our guards.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.320
Or will your guards
be safe with me?

05:55.780 --> 05:57.180
Spike, the Brave and Glorious.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.200
You've faced the evil
Changelings before.

05:59.420 --> 06:00.300
What can you tell us?

06:00.600 --> 06:05.860
Oh. Um. Well, they are
Changelings, so they can change.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.640
Do you hear that? These monsters
can look like any of us,

06:08.720 --> 06:11.580
so be on guard, guards.
Even more than normal.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.780
And they could be anywhere.

06:15.860 --> 06:18.620
So we should cover as
much ground as possible.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.620
You, search that way!

06:22.380 --> 06:24.260
And you search that way!

06:27.220 --> 06:31.660
And I'll just search
here, I guess.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.600
Not many places to hide.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.390
Unless that rock
is a Changeling.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.160
OK, "rock", how do I know
you're really a rock?

06:42.420 --> 06:46.600
Hmm not talking, huh?
Well, you can't fool me.

06:47.380 --> 06:48.040
Whoa!

06:59.060 --> 07:01.840
Whew.

07:02.780 --> 07:06.420
OK. Maybe it's time Spike
the Brave and Glorious

07:06.480 --> 07:08.840
went back to, ah,
protect those guards.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.680
Phew. Just my reflection.

07:14.780 --> 07:15.560
Huh?

07:20.740 --> 07:24.940
Ha hah! Hmm, just my
imagination, I guess.

07:29.820 --> 07:32.100
AUGGGGGHHHH!

07:33.620 --> 07:37.340
Ch-ch-ch-changeling!!

07:39.580 --> 07:41.380
No, wait! Come back!

07:41.440 --> 07:42.840
AAAAHHHHHH!

07:43.980 --> 07:47.100
AAAAHHHHHH!

07:48.480 --> 07:49.830
This is unexpected.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.580
The ice is pretty slippery.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.760
I wouldn't want you to
get hurt because of me.

07:59.180 --> 08:00.980
You... saved me?

08:01.540 --> 08:05.120
It's OK. I know you
don't want to be friends.

08:05.980 --> 08:06.920
Wait!

08:07.400 --> 08:11.880
I don't understand. Changelings
are supposed to be evil, right?

08:12.500 --> 08:16.360
Evil? Oh, not me. All I've
ever wanted is a friend.

08:17.300 --> 08:20.700
From the moment I first split
my egg in the nursery hive.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.340
I was part of the
attack on Canterlot

08:35.400 --> 08:36.500
during the Royal Wedding.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.017
But I'd never seen true
friendship like that,

08:39.140 --> 08:41.800
and I couldn't just steal
it and feed on its love.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.580
I wanted to share it!

08:46.040 --> 08:49.420
After that, I knew I couldn't
live with my kind anymore.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.320
I set off looking for
love to share. But--

08:52.900 --> 08:53.940
But what?

08:54.420 --> 08:55.920
I'm starving!

08:56.180 --> 08:59.380
And there's so much love in
the Crystal Empire right now.

08:59.570 --> 09:03.760
It's what drew me here,
but it's driving me crazy!

09:04.100 --> 09:05.840
That would be from
the Royal Crystalling.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.100
It's pretty much a giant
outpouring of light and love

09:08.160 --> 09:08.800
for a new baby.

09:09.940 --> 09:14.210
Oh, sorry.
I'm just so hungry.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.680
If I had a friend, maybe the
love we shared could sustain me,

09:17.740 --> 09:20.540
but I don't think the Crystal
Ponies want to be friends.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.040
What if I told you there was
somepony they respect and admire

09:26.080 --> 09:29.040
so much, he could convince
them to give it a try?

09:29.500 --> 09:30.780
If only that were true!

09:31.240 --> 09:35.640
It is! I mean, I
am. It's ME! Spike!

09:38.140 --> 09:41.760
Spike? The Brave and Glorious?
I'm sure you've heard of me.

09:42.140 --> 09:45.860
No, but I was raised by
an evil queen. I'm Thorax.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.540
I can't believe you
want to help me.

09:48.780 --> 09:52.240
Why? Hasn't anypony ever
just been nice to you?

09:53.480 --> 09:59.740
Sorry! Sorry! Kindness
like that kind of brings it out.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.220
Do you still want
to be my friend?

10:02.420 --> 10:06.070
Of course! And I am one
hundred percent sure

10:06.100 --> 10:08.740
I can get the whole Crystal
Empire to be your friend too.

10:11.500 --> 10:15.180
But, maybe I should just uh,
talk to them first.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.480
What do you mean? Did
you see the Changeling?

10:19.780 --> 10:21.400
Did you defeat
the evil creature?

10:21.760 --> 10:23.960
Defeating a Changeling
would be brave,

10:24.420 --> 10:26.260
but do you know what
would be glorious?

10:26.340 --> 10:28.220
Defeating two Changelings?

10:28.320 --> 10:30.640
Defeating all the Changelings?

10:31.460 --> 10:33.230
Not having to fight
the Changeling at all

10:33.320 --> 10:35.320
because I made
friends with him.

10:35.830 --> 10:42.020
Ha hah! Oh. Wow. For a second
I thought you were serious!

10:42.309 --> 10:47.145
Ha ha! Could you imagine?
Friends with a Changeling?

10:47.420 --> 10:50.080
I am serious. He
wants to be friends.

10:50.380 --> 10:54.260
Ha ha ha! Right!

10:54.320 --> 10:56.750
Not only are you Spike
the Brave and Glorious,

10:56.860 --> 10:59.890
you're also Spike
the Hilarious! Ha ha!

11:00.020 --> 11:02.820
I'm not joking. The
Changeling is nice.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.760
HA HA HA!

11:06.820 --> 11:09.520
I'm sorry. But I don't
think it's funny.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.600
The Changeling Queen,
Chrysalis, kidnapped Cadance

11:12.720 --> 11:14.030
and cast a spell on me.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.660
There's no such thing
as a nice Changeling.

11:21.080 --> 11:26.440
You're right, Shining Armor.
Sorry. That was a... bad joke.

11:28.900 --> 11:32.100
So? So! What did they say? How
many new friends do I have?

11:32.260 --> 11:36.260
Well... it didn't go
exactly the way I thought.

11:38.764 --> 11:43.168
Uh, I understand. Well,
thanks for trying.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.680
I-I guess it's not surprising.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.700
How can you expect ponies
who look like this.

11:49.620 --> 11:53.080
To trust something
that looks like this?

11:54.760 --> 11:56.880
I think I might know.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.220
Spike, if you're done
searching for the Changeling,

12:07.280 --> 12:08.800
Starlight and I
could use your help.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.360
We're working on a protection
spell for Flurry Heart

12:11.600 --> 12:13.540
and nopony takes
notes like you.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.860
Uh actually, Twilight,

12:17.130 --> 12:19.660
I wanted to introduce
you to my friend, um...

12:20.600 --> 12:22.940
...Crystal! ...Hoof!

12:23.660 --> 12:26.720
Crystal Hoof, my good
friend, Crystal Hoof.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.780
Nice to meet you.

12:29.460 --> 12:33.600
Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you
too. How do you know Spike?

12:34.160 --> 12:36.750
Oh, Spike and I go way back--

12:36.780 --> 12:38.080
--to the Equestria Games.

12:38.290 --> 12:41.720
That's when we met. We've
been pen pals ever since.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.830
Pen pals! Spike, you could have
been using my pen pal quill set!

12:45.860 --> 12:47.460
Why didn't you tell me?

12:47.800 --> 12:50.800
Well, I-I pretty much
only write to him

12:50.860 --> 12:52.780
when you and Starlight
are studying.

12:53.020 --> 12:56.200
I like to brag to all my
friends about my letters

12:56.240 --> 12:58.460
from Spike the
Brave and Glorious.

13:02.260 --> 13:04.200
Well, I'm sure Starlight
and I can manage,

13:04.260 --> 13:06.040
if you want to spend
time with your friend.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.260
Great! Crystal Hoof promised
to take me around the city.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.450
Ha! That was amazing!

13:12.880 --> 13:13.920
I told ya.

13:44.660 --> 13:47.920
Crystal Hoof is nearly as
entertaining as Spike himself!

13:49.640 --> 13:53.660
Ah! This place is everything
I've ever dreamed of.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.800
But I can't keep
pretending

13:55.860 --> 13:58.340
to be a Crystal
Pony forever, can I?

13:59.160 --> 14:01.820
Relax, you're winning them over.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.260
Pretty soon, nopony will care
that you're a Changeling.

14:06.040 --> 14:06.800
<i>Spike!</i>

14:09.820 --> 14:12.040
Twilight told me you
were off with a friend.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.300
And any friend of Spike
the Brave and Glorious

14:17.340 --> 14:18.460
is a friend of mine.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.720
Oh she's so beautiful!

14:27.140 --> 14:34.230
There's so much LOVE
around her. I-- I--

14:36.540 --> 14:43.460
I, I'm so sorry!
I can't-can't stop.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.760
Spike, get away
from the Changeling!

14:46.360 --> 14:48.840
Wait! No! You
don't understand.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.550
This Changeling replaced your
friend to get close to the baby.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.400
What other explanation
could there be?

15:00.380 --> 15:01.140
I don't know.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.471
After it! Don't let
the Changeling escape!

15:06.720 --> 15:08.400
I hope your friend is OK.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.200
Yeah... me too.

15:20.860 --> 15:23.180
Spike, you should
go find Crystal Hoof

15:23.220 --> 15:24.480
while we hunt down
the Changeling.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.000
I'm pretty sure he
doesn't want to see me.

15:27.380 --> 15:31.860
Spread out! The Changeling
is probably still nearby.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.820
Actually, I'm
pretty sure he ran

15:36.860 --> 15:38.900
as far away from
here as possible.

15:39.620 --> 15:42.220
But I bet I know where!

15:43.400 --> 15:45.560
Thorax? Hello?

15:46.520 --> 15:50.260
I just want to apologize. I
should have stood up for you.

15:51.220 --> 15:55.180
Aw, come on, Thorax.
I know you're in here.

15:55.989 --> 15:59.390
Leave me alone!

15:59.440 --> 16:04.120
Um... little help?

16:04.320 --> 16:08.840
Why do you think I would help
you? I'm an evil Changeling!

16:09.060 --> 16:10.760
Because you're my friend.

16:11.660 --> 16:13.900
I just wish I had
been one to you.

16:14.070 --> 16:15.380
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

16:20.640 --> 16:23.520
It's OK. I know it's hard.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.600
Everyone in the Crystal
Empire loves you.

16:27.080 --> 16:30.020
I couldn't ask you to
give that up for me.

16:30.520 --> 16:31.840
You don't have to ask.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.360
What are you going to do?

16:34.140 --> 16:36.540
What I should have done
in the first place.

16:37.780 --> 16:39.120
Let's move, move, move, move.

16:39.140 --> 16:43.480
Have you checked there?
Look around that corner.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.760
I know it's bad that
there's a Changeling around,

16:47.800 --> 16:50.400
but is all this
really necessary?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.160
If there's one Changeling,

16:52.200 --> 16:54.380
there may well be a
whole army on the way.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.860
True, but Starlight
has a point.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.620
This is getting a
little out of hand.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.750
I understand, but I don't
know what else we can do.

17:02.860 --> 17:03.680
I do!

17:07.040 --> 17:10.580
Spike! What are you doing?
Get away from that thing!

17:10.900 --> 17:15.940
No. He's not a thing. His name
is Thorax. And he's my friend.

19:58.380 --> 20:00.740
Spike, I'm so
proud of you.

20:00.820 --> 20:01.500
You are?

20:01.660 --> 20:04.920
Of course! You're a celebrity
here in the Crystal Empire

20:05.100 --> 20:07.140
and you just risked
all of it for a friend.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.120
I can't imagine anything
more brave than that.

20:11.260 --> 20:12.820
As the Princess of Friendship,

20:12.920 --> 20:15.640
I try to set an example
for all of Equestria.

20:15.820 --> 20:19.550
But today, it was Spike who
taught me that a new friend

20:19.600 --> 20:22.420
can come from anywhere.
I guess everypony

20:22.460 --> 20:25.420
still has things to learn
about friendship, even me.

20:25.760 --> 20:29.460
And if Spike says Thorax is his
friend, then he's my friend too.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.460
Thank you.

20:33.900 --> 20:38.020
On behalf of the Crystal Empire,
I would like to extend my hoof

20:38.040 --> 20:41.000
in friendship and I am
sure all of my subjects

20:41.040 --> 20:42.720
are eager to do the same.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.280
Welcome to the Crystal
Empire, Thorax.

20:55.540 --> 20:57.900
I'm sorry we didn't take the
time to get to know you.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.020
Maybe we can change that now.

21:00.780 --> 21:04.480
That'd be so amazing! I want
to know all about friendship.

21:04.580 --> 21:06.990
And maybe one day I can
take that knowledge back

21:07.060 --> 21:08.260
to the Changeling Kingdom.

21:08.580 --> 21:11.820
If my kind learned how to
create love for one another,

21:12.100 --> 21:14.100
maybe they wouldn't have
to take it from others!

21:14.600 --> 21:16.560
To Spike the Brave and Glorious!

21:25.140 --> 21:26.880
Looks like you were
right after all.

21:27.020 --> 21:27.960
Right about what?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.960
Friendship lessons
can happen anywhere.
