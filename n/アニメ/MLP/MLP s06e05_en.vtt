00:12.360 --> 00:13.560
The last time I was here,

00:13.820 --> 00:16.740
I woke them and ended up
with a mane full of bats!

00:17.240 --> 00:20.180
Thanks for being
my basket holder, Spike.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.080
Basket holder? I thought
I was your bodyguard.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.420
What? Oh yes, yes.
That of course, too.

00:27.740 --> 00:30.560
Oh for once I wish
unicorn magic wasn't so...

00:30.820 --> 00:31.920
luminescent.

00:33.740 --> 00:36.760
Spike, you'll wake the
bats! Turn that off!

00:37.040 --> 00:39.430
I can't! Oooh!

00:48.440 --> 00:59.800

We have muffins!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

01:21.400 --> 01:23.100
<i>I'm so glad</i>
<i> you two could come.</i>

01:23.400 --> 01:25.500
Of course. We so
rarely get a chance

01:25.520 --> 01:26.860
to relax and just visit.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.520
There's usually some crisis
we have to deal with.

01:29.740 --> 01:32.520
Somepony always needs
our help. But today--

01:32.560 --> 01:37.120
HELP! Twilight! There's
something wrong with Spike!

01:39.740 --> 01:40.560
What's wrong?

01:41.340 --> 01:44.020
I don't know!
All of the sudden

01:44.060 --> 01:46.840
my scales just started
glowing and burning.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.060
Little is known
about dragon culture,

01:49.400 --> 01:51.920
but this is a phenomenon
we've seen before.

01:52.340 --> 01:54.500
It is the Call of
The Dragon Lord.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.240
Dragons glow whenever
the Dragon Lord

01:57.280 --> 01:59.320
has need of them
in the Dragonlands.

01:59.540 --> 02:03.100
Great! How
do I make it stop?

02:03.620 --> 02:06.420
The only way to end the
summons is to answer it.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.340
You must journey
to the Dragonlands

02:08.380 --> 02:10.040
and see what is
expected of you.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.800
But the Dragonlands
are full of... dragons!

02:14.100 --> 02:15.620
And they're
ghastly creatures!

02:17.200 --> 02:19.120
Oh-oh not you of
course, Spikey Wikey.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.220
But remember that
rotten Garble?

02:21.440 --> 02:23.300
How could
I forget?

02:23.660 --> 02:25.780
He would have burnt us to a
crisp if you weren't there.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.760
If I have to go to
the Dragonlands,

02:28.000 --> 02:28.980
would you two come with me?

02:29.260 --> 02:32.680
Oooh! Oh my goodness! I'd
love to! We are sadly lacking

02:32.700 --> 02:34.780
any information on dragon
culture and customs.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.140
I could research them, maybe
even write an article!

02:37.160 --> 02:39.440
This could be my chance to
make a great contribution

02:39.500 --> 02:40.800
to the knowledge of Equestria!

02:43.140 --> 02:45.480
And be there for
Spike, of course.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.120
Be very careful.

02:47.340 --> 02:49.460
The Dragonlands are
particularly dangerous

02:49.520 --> 02:52.460
for ponies. It would
be wise to be discreet.

02:52.820 --> 02:55.820
Oh, I'm sure I still have
the dragon costume we used

02:55.860 --> 02:58.420
the last time we snuck into
the Dragonlands!

02:58.660 --> 03:00.080
I think we might
want something

03:00.120 --> 03:01.900
a little more
practical this time.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.340
Well, it may
be practical,

03:06.580 --> 03:09.020
but this disguise isn't
flattering in the slightest!

03:09.400 --> 03:11.260
It's not supposed
to be flattering;

03:11.320 --> 03:12.860
it's supposed to blend in!

03:13.060 --> 03:13.650
SHHHH!

03:19.820 --> 03:24.100
Hey, look. It's our old
friend, Sparkle Warkle.

03:24.340 --> 03:25.430
It's Spike.

03:25.700 --> 03:29.270
Are you sure your pony friends
didn't give you a pony name?

03:29.700 --> 03:32.340
It's nice to see
you too, Garble!

03:32.660 --> 03:35.300
I didn't say it was nice
to see you. It's not.

03:35.540 --> 03:37.080
I don't like you.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.280
Was I not clear about that?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.780
Hey! That's my rock.

03:43.940 --> 03:47.260
Oh really? Then why
aren't you sitting on it?

03:57.740 --> 04:01.480
Dragons of Equestria! Hear me!

04:01.740 --> 04:03.800
I have been Dragon
Lord for longer

04:03.840 --> 04:05.710
than many of you
can remember.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.620
And my reign has
been extraordinary.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.420
AGREE WITH ME!

04:15.356 --> 04:17.022
Torch! Torch! Torch!

04:18.860 --> 04:20.200
Who is that?

04:20.460 --> 04:22.360
It's Dragon Lord Torch, dummy.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.890
No, next to him.

04:24.380 --> 04:26.290
That's his daughter,
Princess Ember.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.500
I wouldn't even look
at her if I were you.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.460
Unless you want
Torch to eat you.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.220
This is fascinating! Dragons
are notoriously reckless,

04:35.340 --> 04:37.470
but they do whatever
the Dragon Lord says.

04:37.740 --> 04:41.680
Unfortunately,
according to dragon law,

04:41.860 --> 04:46.080
it is time for me to
step down. Sad, I know.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.140
BE SAD!

04:52.840 --> 04:54.640
This is why I have
summoned you.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.240
To compete for the throne
in the Gauntlet of Fire!

05:02.400 --> 05:05.020
Whomever has the
strength and fortitude

05:05.120 --> 05:07.820
to retrieve this
Bloodstone Scepter

05:08.020 --> 05:10.160
from the heart of
the Flamecano

05:10.520 --> 05:14.780
will be crowned Lord
of the Dragons!

05:25.500 --> 05:28.760
When the scepter disappeared,
the dragons stopped glowing!

05:28.820 --> 05:30.460
We are learning so much!

05:32.740 --> 05:34.540
Ah ah ah ....

05:34.840 --> 05:35.680
choo!

05:36.180 --> 05:37.530
Uh, Excuse me.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.930
Ugh. You even
sneeze like a pony.

05:41.320 --> 05:45.860
The Gauntlet is dangerous,
for I designed it myself.

05:46.200 --> 05:51.340
Only dragons with my ferocity,
strength and determination

05:51.420 --> 05:52.660
will be able to finish.

05:53.080 --> 05:57.200
We will gather at the cliff
when the sun is at its peak!

05:59.080 --> 06:01.100
I don't want to be Dragon
Lord or dragon toast

06:01.120 --> 06:03.100
and I stopped glowing so
let's sneak out of here!

06:06.520 --> 06:09.560
Where do you think you're
going, little dragon?

06:12.500 --> 06:16.240
Oh, uh, hi Your Lordship.
I was just going home.

06:16.840 --> 06:19.820
You don't get to leave
unless I say you can.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.510
Dad, look at him!
He's just a runt.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.950
Besides, he doesn't even
want to compete. Let him go.

06:27.380 --> 06:32.960
He is rather tiny. I could
squish him with my pinky claw.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.860
That wasn't a joke;
it was a fact.

06:38.220 --> 06:41.620
When I want you to laugh
I will say "BE AMUSED"!

06:41.700 --> 06:43.000
Of course, Your Lordship.

06:43.420 --> 06:46.440
I guess I don't understand
dragon customs.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.500
Another reason why
I shouldn't compete.

06:50.420 --> 06:53.600
Very well, little
dragon. I release you.

06:53.900 --> 06:54.540
Thank you!

06:54.840 --> 06:55.820
And thank you.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.480
Where do you think you're going?

07:02.740 --> 07:03.820
To prepare for the gauntlet.

07:04.280 --> 07:08.100
No, you're not. You're not
much bigger than that runt

07:08.160 --> 07:09.260
I just sent home.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.960
But I'm smarter than most
of these boulderheads

07:11.980 --> 07:13.030
and you know it.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.280
Being smart won't help
you win this gauntlet.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.940
It was designed for a
big strong dragon to win

07:20.200 --> 07:23.360
because it takes a big
strong dragon to lead.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.540
Besides, I SAID NO!

07:26.760 --> 07:29.520
I hate when he does that!

07:32.900 --> 07:34.400
When I become Dragon Lord,

07:34.440 --> 07:37.140
I will make burps an
official greeting.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.120
Ha, you? Please.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.000
When I win, I will
pillage Equestria

07:42.060 --> 07:43.240
for all their pillows!

07:43.500 --> 07:45.320
Why should these
ponies be comfortable

07:45.360 --> 07:47.120
while we sleep on rocks?

07:47.260 --> 07:49.700
That's nothing.
When I'm in charge,

07:49.920 --> 07:53.280
the first thing I'll do is get
revenge on those puny ponies!

07:53.600 --> 07:56.040
They'll regret they
ever crossed Garble!

07:56.360 --> 07:58.720
We'll take whatever
we want from Equestria

07:58.740 --> 08:00.280
and burn the rest.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.580
Oh my gosh. I can't
believe I'm saying this,

08:04.860 --> 08:07.000
but I hope that
burping dragon wins.

08:07.260 --> 08:08.400
None of them can win!

08:08.540 --> 08:11.180
Equestria is in big trouble
if any of them are in charge!

08:11.680 --> 08:12.720
But what
can we do?

08:13.140 --> 08:15.900
There's only one thing to
do and only I can do it.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.780
I have to win the
Gauntlet of Fire!

08:25.040 --> 08:27.270
What do you mean you
have to win the Gauntlet?

08:27.680 --> 08:30.480
It's the only way to protect
Equestria from the dragons!

08:30.700 --> 08:32.700
You heard them. They have
horrible plans for ponies

08:32.700 --> 08:35.940
if they win! So somehow,
I have to do it.

08:36.460 --> 08:37.720
There has to be another way!

08:37.980 --> 08:39.160
It's too dangerous.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.000
Besides, if you win,
you'd have to stay here!

08:42.320 --> 08:45.680
I know. But there's no other
way to keep my friends safe.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.160
Well, if you're
staying to compete,

08:49.220 --> 08:51.100
then we're staying
to cheer you on.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.700
I thought I released
you, Tiny One.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.910
I decided to compete. I
am a dragon, after all.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.720
Are you sure? You
can't even fly!

09:13.200 --> 09:15.140
All dragons are
welcome to compete,

09:15.620 --> 09:17.750
for they do so at
their own peril.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.680
Flying to Flamecano Island is
the first of many challenges

09:21.720 --> 09:26.300
you will face in your quest to
find the Bloodstone Scepter!

09:30.960 --> 09:33.780
Good luck. Just kidding,
I hope you lose.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.100
Aaaaah!

09:39.220 --> 09:42.600
Thanks, Garble, I was
planning on swimming anyway!

09:44.120 --> 09:45.540
You can do it, Spike!

10:04.680 --> 10:05.820
He's gonna drown!

10:06.680 --> 10:07.620
SPIKE!

10:17.500 --> 10:19.040
Hey, are you OK?

10:24.200 --> 10:25.300
Princess Ember!

10:25.700 --> 10:27.150
What do you think you're doing?

10:27.500 --> 10:29.600
Only saving your
ungrateful scales!

10:30.680 --> 10:32.800
Did that seaweed just talk?

10:35.520 --> 10:37.960
Ponies? What are
they doing here?

10:38.440 --> 10:39.400
They're my friends!

10:39.800 --> 10:43.000
Friends? Dragons
don't do friends.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.820
Well, this dragon does!

10:45.440 --> 10:48.880
Whatever. I don't care as long
as none of you get in my way.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.640
I have a gauntlet to win.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.160
But I thought your dad said...

10:52.220 --> 10:53.880
I don't care what my dad said!

10:54.140 --> 10:56.560
I'll show him and
everydragon who thinks

10:56.560 --> 10:58.120
I'm just a little "Princess"

10:58.360 --> 11:00.480
there are better things
than being big and strong!

11:02.860 --> 11:03.780
Aaah!

11:11.360 --> 11:12.760
Don't leave me here, Spike!

11:17.140 --> 11:18.910
Ha ha! I knew you'd do it.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.360
Your pony friends made you soft.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.120
Uh-huh. You're welcome.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.850
For what? I didn't
say thank you.

11:28.580 --> 11:31.220
Wow, you even smell like ponies.

11:32.580 --> 11:34.360
Or is it coming from over there?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.100
Uh, that's just me.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.540
I uh, robbed some ponies
on my way over here.

11:46.220 --> 11:47.540
I like your style.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.820
Have I met you before?
You kinda look like--

11:50.860 --> 11:56.120
My uh, old neighbor,
uh, Sandy Rockbeach!

11:57.500 --> 11:59.760
Stupid slingtails
knocked me down.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.220
But I've wasted enough time
making small talk. Get it?

12:03.860 --> 12:05.900
Because you're too small
to win this. I'm funny.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.520
Why did you cover for me?

12:09.840 --> 12:11.540
You could have had
one less competitor.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.720
I could ask you the same thing.

12:14.180 --> 12:16.560
You could have told
Garble about my friends.

12:19.660 --> 12:21.460
Yikes. That looks rough.

12:22.060 --> 12:23.860
But that's what
makes it a challenge.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.580
Are you kidding? Those
boulders are huge!

12:27.700 --> 12:29.660
Hey, what if we
work together?

12:31.620 --> 12:33.380
You fly me up there and
I'll help you look out

12:33.420 --> 12:35.380
for boulders like a
second set of eyes!

12:35.480 --> 12:36.060
PSSST!

12:39.500 --> 12:40.380
Spike!

12:42.260 --> 12:44.860
Are you sure it's a good
idea to team up with Ember?

12:45.180 --> 12:46.430
You don't know her too well.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.720
I do know she could have
told Garble about you,

12:48.740 --> 12:50.960
but she didn't. I
think we can trust her.

12:51.220 --> 12:53.060
Her behavior does seem
contradictory to everything

12:53.080 --> 12:54.500
I've noted about
dragons so far.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.500
Hey! You. Little fella.

12:56.820 --> 13:00.540
I've thought about it and your
plan makes sense. Let's do it.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.940
Really? Great! It's a deal.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.100
Just so you know, this doesn't
mean we're gonna pick flowers

13:08.140 --> 13:10.740
or exchange necklaces or
whatever pony friends do.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.160
Good luck. We'll
meet you at the top.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.280
Pull up, there's
one on your tail!

13:31.440 --> 13:32.060
Go left!

13:39.140 --> 13:40.110
So, what do we do now?

13:40.440 --> 13:41.540
I think we go through there.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.080
Ah! Oh,
that looks scary!

13:52.500 --> 13:54.560
I mean, you can do it!

13:54.920 --> 13:57.930
Listen, Spike, I wouldn't have
made it this far without you.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.620
So I guess, if you want to, we
could keep working together.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.740
I mean, just until we
get through that tunnel.

14:04.100 --> 14:04.860
OK.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.300
We'll be right behind you.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.280
Agh!

14:55.640 --> 14:59.160
Oh, you made it!
Oh, we were so worried.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.140
About us? Pssh. That
tunnel was cake.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.120
Wait, how did you
two get through?

15:10.340 --> 15:11.040
Rarity!

15:17.280 --> 15:18.800
Oh thanks, Spike!

15:19.085 --> 15:20.618
It was nothing.

15:20.980 --> 15:24.220
Nothing? You just risked
everything to save her.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.350
And they're putting themselves
in danger just to support you.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.090
That's just what friends do.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.420
Don't you have anyone
who looks out for you?

15:31.840 --> 15:34.400
Not really. Unless
I count you...

15:35.060 --> 15:38.220
...which I don't because we
were only helping each other

15:38.260 --> 15:40.680
get through the tunnel and now
we're through the tunnel so,

15:41.080 --> 15:41.780
that's it.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.540
Wait. What do you mean?

15:43.900 --> 15:47.040
Well, there's only one
winner, one scepter

15:47.080 --> 15:48.540
and one Dragon Lord.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.200
So I guess it's every
dragon for themselves.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.300
Oh. So we aren't
really friends?

15:55.640 --> 15:57.220
Maybe if we were in ponyland

15:57.280 --> 16:00.200
but like I said, dragons
don't do friendship.

16:10.980 --> 16:13.170
I can't believe
Ember ditched me.

16:13.380 --> 16:16.800
Oh you're better off. She was
only looking out for herself.

16:17.020 --> 16:18.720
She's just like all
the other dragons.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.680
She's not, though. I know it.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.340
She saved me, even when
she didn't have to.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.560
I don't care what she says.
That makes us friends.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.140
Is it just me or
have we seen this crevice

16:30.160 --> 16:31.280
three times already?

16:31.420 --> 16:34.060
It's kind of hard to tell.
They all look the same.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.700
Except for this one! Look!

16:40.840 --> 16:41.580
We made it!

16:42.720 --> 16:45.230
I can't believe I'm the only
dragon to make it this far.

16:45.620 --> 16:46.600
<i>You're not!</i>

16:47.780 --> 16:51.760
And I'm not losing to a puny
pony-loving dragon like you!

16:53.880 --> 16:55.840
We have to
do something!

16:56.220 --> 16:56.840
Look!

17:02.740 --> 17:05.580
Ember! I thought it was
every dragon for themselves.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.520
Why did you save me?

17:07.680 --> 17:12.160
That's what friends do.
And I am. I mean we are.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.190
I never should have
left you back there.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.030
Ugh, please don't make me
talk about my feelings.

17:17.620 --> 17:18.440
What the--?

17:25.040 --> 17:26.860
Spike! Get the scepter!

17:49.080 --> 17:50.780
Aaaaagh!

17:52.620 --> 17:55.770
I'm sick and tired of you
two helping each other!

17:56.460 --> 17:58.820
Dragons don't do helping!

17:59.080 --> 18:00.840
These dragons do!

18:18.980 --> 18:20.430
Whoa!

18:32.220 --> 18:34.570
Leave her alone!

18:35.100 --> 18:38.340
What? You? You have the scepter?

18:38.780 --> 18:40.380
But that means that you're...

18:40.540 --> 18:43.800
The Dragon Lord.
Dragon Lord Spike.

18:45.860 --> 18:49.520
Aw. Dragon Lord Spike.

18:49.820 --> 18:53.880
That's right. Uh,now go start
your long journey home.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.130
And give every dragon
you see on the way a hug.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.530
Don't tell them why.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.660
Aw, but that'll be
super embarrassing!

19:00.940 --> 19:02.440
I command you to do it!

19:03.560 --> 19:06.300
Ugh. I can't believe this.

19:07.020 --> 19:10.140
"Dragon Lord Spike". Hmm.
Has a nice ring to it.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.780
Dragon Lord Ember
sounds a lot better.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.340
What? No. You're
the Dragon Lord now.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.740
The Dragon Lord is whoever
brings the scepter back

19:18.760 --> 19:19.500
to your father.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.740
Besides, you'll
make a great leader.

19:22.180 --> 19:24.240
I was just doing this
to protect the ponies,

19:24.560 --> 19:27.100
but I know you'll protect them
just as well as I would have.

19:27.540 --> 19:28.690
Are you sure about this?

19:29.120 --> 19:32.300
Absolutely. My home is in
Equestria with my friends.

19:32.620 --> 19:35.460
Well, you'll have at least
one friend here, too.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.340
What are you doing?

19:37.600 --> 19:39.440
It's called a hug.

19:39.820 --> 19:43.440
Oh. I don't know if
I like it, but OK.

19:45.660 --> 19:46.480
Aw.

19:56.860 --> 19:58.820
Ember? You?

19:59.120 --> 20:02.160
I know you didn't think
I could do it, but I did.

20:02.580 --> 20:06.220
I expressly told you NOT TO
DO IT! Because you're not--

20:06.260 --> 20:09.600
--I'm not big and strong!
I know! But you know what?

20:09.860 --> 20:13.460
I won anyway. So, maybe it
takes more than just being

20:13.520 --> 20:15.720
big and strong to be
a good Dragon Lord.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.250
I was wrong, Ember.

20:20.500 --> 20:25.080
You might not be big, but
you are strong. And smart.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.900
And perhaps that counts
for more than I thought.

20:28.380 --> 20:31.660
And you will make
an excellent leader.

20:32.740 --> 20:33.960
Thanks, Dad.

20:35.140 --> 20:36.440
AGREE WITH HIM!

20:38.320 --> 20:41.200
Just kidding. That's
not gonna be my thing.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.710
Dragons, hear me!

20:47.000 --> 20:51.900
I present to you our new
Dragon Lord... Ember!

20:58.940 --> 21:00.240
What is the meaning of this?

21:00.840 --> 21:02.460
I can't tell you!

21:05.520 --> 21:08.320
You did well, Spike. With
Ember as Dragon Lord,

21:08.340 --> 21:10.300
the ponies will be safe
and you've gained us

21:10.320 --> 21:11.600
a powerful ally.

21:11.760 --> 21:12.770
And a new friend.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.540
Plus, Ember said I could
write to her any time

21:15.580 --> 21:17.380
I had questions
about dragon culture!

21:17.520 --> 21:18.580
With this much information,

21:18.780 --> 21:20.920
I'll be able to write a
whole book on dragons!!

21:21.120 --> 21:24.220
And I gained tons of
ideas for a new line

21:24.240 --> 21:28.780
of camouflage clothing! I
think I'll call it camo-mod.
