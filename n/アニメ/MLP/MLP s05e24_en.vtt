WEBVTT

00:16.740 --> 00:17.740
Wow, Applejack!

00:17.940 --> 00:20.350
Are you sure you've never
managed a concert before?

00:20.520 --> 00:22.480
Well, it turns out
doin' up a concert's

00:22.480 --> 00:24.020
the same as settin' up a rodeo.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.160
And thanks to Pinkie's
connections organizing

00:26.160 --> 00:27.690
the Ponypalooza Rock Concert,

00:27.920 --> 00:29.160
we've got quite a line-up

00:29.160 --> 00:30.840
for the Helping
Hooves Music Festival.

00:32.140 --> 00:34.900
Twilight! Applejack! Rainbow
Dash! Rarity! Fluttershy! Spike!

00:34.900 --> 00:38.340
Pinkie Pie! Oh, wait,
that's me! EVERYPONY!

00:39.320 --> 00:40.340
What is it, Pinkie?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.640
I have the most
amazing news ever!

00:42.920 --> 00:46.500
It is totally going
to freak your frizz!

00:47.000 --> 00:48.720
Well, spill it, Pinkie!

00:49.200 --> 00:52.680
It wasn't easy. In fact,
it was terribly difficult.

00:52.980 --> 00:55.740
But I have managed to book
the biggest Pony Pop Star

00:55.740 --> 00:58.160
in all of Equestria
as the main attraction

00:58.160 --> 01:00.380
of the Helping Hooves
Music Festival!

01:00.840 --> 01:01.960
Sapphire Shores?

01:02.120 --> 01:04.590
Sapphire Shores? Please!

01:04.860 --> 01:07.560
Sapphire Shores is merely the
SECOND biggest Pony Pop Star

01:07.560 --> 01:08.220
in Equestria!

01:09.100 --> 01:15.200
I have booked: The One. The
Only. Countess Coloratura!

01:15.500 --> 01:17.800
OOOOOOOOOO! AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!

01:18.040 --> 01:20.860
Who in the hay is
Countess Coloratura?

01:25.220 --> 01:27.060
My frizz has been freaked.

01:34.560 --> 01:46.360
Regular subtitles

We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

02:07.760 --> 02:11.600
Pinkie Pie, who is this
Countess Coloratura pony?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.760
I just told you

02:13.760 --> 02:16.040
that she's the biggest Pony
Pop Star in Equestria!

02:16.260 --> 02:19.370
How, how, how, how, how
have you not heard of her?

02:19.780 --> 02:23.060
Don' know. Though I did
know a gal named Coloratura

02:23.060 --> 02:24.120
when I was just a filly.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.920
Wouldn't it just be the funniest
thing if that Coloratura

02:28.120 --> 02:30.840
and this Coloratura were
the same Coloratura?

02:31.760 --> 02:34.440
Do you mean to tell me
that you actually know

02:34.440 --> 02:35.780
Countess Coloratura?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.020
Well, I don't think
it's the same pony

02:38.020 --> 02:41.020
since my friend wasn't any
sort of highfalutin' Countess.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.580
Do you remember her Cutie Mark?

02:42.980 --> 02:46.140
Sure do! It had this super
colorful bunch of musical notes

02:46.140 --> 02:47.660
that just shimmered
in the light.

02:48.140 --> 02:49.640
You mean, like this?

02:51.140 --> 02:54.600
Well, fancy that! That there's
the very same Cutie Mark!

02:54.740 --> 02:56.860
Do you have any idea the number
of hoops I had to jump through

02:56.860 --> 03:00.520
to get her to perform at the
Festival? A whole lot of hoops!

03:00.700 --> 03:02.280
That pony is very demanding!

03:02.620 --> 03:03.580
Naw!

03:03.720 --> 03:05.200
Yaaaaw!

03:05.740 --> 03:07.480
I completely understand.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.800
We artistes require
certain necessities

03:11.060 --> 03:12.520
in order to do our best work.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.000
This was clearly some
sort of misunderstandin',

03:15.300 --> 03:17.560
cause Rara was just
as down home as me!

03:17.920 --> 03:19.000
Rara?

03:19.360 --> 03:21.800
Even that big name
was too fancy for her.

03:22.100 --> 03:25.340
So I shortened
ColoRAtuRA to Rara.

03:28.060 --> 03:30.220
<i> We had the best time</i>
<i> at Camp Friendship.</i>

03:30.660 --> 03:32.440
<i> Rara was just so easy goin'.</i>

03:33.140 --> 03:35.520
<i> We were like two apples</i>
<i> from the same branch.</i>

03:36.580 --> 03:39.220
<i> Rara and I prepared this song</i>
<i> for the Camp Talent Show.</i>

03:39.700 --> 03:42.020
<i> When we performed,</i>
<i> she belted it out,</i>

03:42.020 --> 03:45.520

04:27.300 --> 04:29.200
but then we lost touch.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.720
But Rara always did
want to go to Manehattan

04:31.720 --> 04:32.770
to try and make it big.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.840
But a demandin' diva?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.600
Just you wait, Pinkie.

04:37.780 --> 04:41.000
Once Rara gets here, you'll see
she's just a plain ol' pony

04:41.000 --> 04:41.980
like you or me.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.540
I don't have to
wait! She's here!

04:46.080 --> 04:46.720
Really?

05:05.240 --> 05:06.070
Rara?

05:10.580 --> 05:14.740
AAAAAAH! COUNTESS COLORATURA!

05:17.450 --> 05:19.450
Clear the way. Step back.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.720
Keep your hooves and
tails to yourselves.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.940
No. That can't be her.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.600
Um...Hi. Remember me? We
met at Camp Friendship?

05:33.120 --> 05:35.000
I gave you the
nickname Rara?

05:37.240 --> 05:37.960
AJ?

05:38.220 --> 05:40.100
Yeah! Howdy, Rara!

05:44.600 --> 05:45.680
Hoovsies!

05:49.180 --> 05:53.380
Ooh! You got Hoovsies from
Countess Coloratura! Look!

05:54.260 --> 05:56.720
Ooh! She clearly thinks
you're very special!

05:57.080 --> 06:01.240
Hoovsies! Hoovsies! Hoovsies!

06:02.180 --> 06:04.320
Yeah, real special.

06:06.060 --> 06:08.730
Now that's how you
make an entrance!

06:09.020 --> 06:13.120
Big! Bold! Absolutely stunning!

06:13.640 --> 06:16.800
Though it was muddied a
bit with your interaction

06:16.800 --> 06:21.560
with that dusty farm pony.
Do you actually know her?

06:21.940 --> 06:24.980
Oh, yeah. That's my
childhood filly friend, AJ!

06:25.240 --> 06:27.580
She was the one that
started calling me Rara.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.680
Oh, yes. How cute and common.

06:32.060 --> 06:35.640
Of course, I was the one that
started calling you Countess!

06:36.120 --> 06:37.690
And just look at how
you've moved up

06:37.690 --> 06:39.160
in Equestria since then!

06:39.340 --> 06:42.840
Why, you've gotten everything
you've ever wanted!

06:43.680 --> 06:45.100
Speaking of which...

06:45.420 --> 06:47.080
Where is the pony Pinkie Pie?

06:47.080 --> 06:49.460
Ooh! I'm the pony Pinkie
Pie, Mr. Manager, sir!

06:49.860 --> 06:52.060
Do you have the water
imported from Rainbow Falls

06:52.060 --> 06:53.840
that I requested for
Countess Coloratura?

06:54.100 --> 06:56.510
I have twenty glass
containers full right here!

06:57.960 --> 07:00.020
Did I not tell you
to provide straws

07:00.020 --> 07:01.900
in all of Countess
Coloratura's beverages?

07:02.300 --> 07:03.740
I don't think so.

07:03.980 --> 07:04.980
But lucky for you,

07:04.980 --> 07:07.620
I have the biggest straw
collection in Equestria!

07:08.000 --> 07:11.300
I call this straw Fernando.

07:13.920 --> 07:18.020
Hmm. Let us confirm that you
acquired the rest of the items

07:18.020 --> 07:19.800
that Countess
Coloratura requested

07:20.000 --> 07:23.220
before she performs her
run-through, shall we?

07:23.420 --> 07:24.720
Oh, we shall!

07:25.420 --> 07:28.520
Floral arrangements from the
Royal Canterlot Gardens.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.450
Chocolate éclairs made
by Gustave le Grande.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.920
A selection of crystals
from the Crystal Empire.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.720
Freshly picked cherries
from Cherry Jubilee's farm

07:36.720 --> 07:38.550
separated red from yellow?

07:38.780 --> 07:39.740
Absotutely!

07:40.200 --> 07:42.240
Well, by some miracle,

07:42.240 --> 07:44.460
your requests have
been reasonably met.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.640
So let us move
on...to rehearsal!

07:49.360 --> 07:51.740
See, Applejack? Demanding!

07:52.620 --> 07:56.540
Pinkie's right, Rarity! The Rara
I knew didn't hide behind a veil

07:56.540 --> 08:00.040
givin' out fake stamp kisses,
sippin' up imported water,

08:00.300 --> 08:02.040
and needin' her
cherries separated.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.040
Oh, I do understand.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.110
Sometimes it's hard to
see our friends change.

08:07.460 --> 08:09.050
She's become a whole other pony!

08:09.400 --> 08:12.620
Trust me, once you see
Countess Coloratura perform,

08:12.840 --> 08:14.720
you simply won't believe it!

Rarity was right.
I don't believe it.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.840
Oh, my shining star! Thanks
to the sparkling costumes,

09:36.080 --> 09:39.100
dazzling choreography, and
brilliant vocal effects

09:39.100 --> 09:40.600
that I designed,

09:41.040 --> 09:43.960
your performance
was SPECTACULAR,

09:43.960 --> 09:45.420
Countess Coloratura!

09:45.740 --> 09:48.060
Oh, thank you, Svengallop!

09:49.020 --> 09:50.380
Correct me if
I'm wrong here,

09:50.380 --> 09:52.820
but that feller isn't
actually complimentin' Rara.

09:53.180 --> 09:55.640
He's complimentin' all the bells
and whistles he's piled on

09:55.640 --> 09:57.600
to make her Countess Coloratura.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.400
Oh, no, no, no, no! You
don't understand, Applejack.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.320
Creating all those
elements is a lot of work

10:03.540 --> 10:05.300
and Countess
Coloratura's performance

10:05.300 --> 10:06.970
wouldn't exist without them.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.260
If you ask me, that wouldn't
necessarily be a bad thing.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.200
Oh, if we're all done here,

10:13.200 --> 10:16.240
I'd love to go back to my
trailer and rest, Svengallop.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.220
Actually, right now
you're scheduled

10:18.220 --> 10:20.200
for your Meet and Greet
with the school ponies!

10:21.680 --> 10:24.600
I can totally get
you out of meeting

10:24.600 --> 10:26.740
with the school
ponies, Countess.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.920
Absolutely not! My
favorite part of any event

10:30.920 --> 10:32.890
is meeting with
the school ponies!

10:33.060 --> 10:35.700
The school ponies'll be so
happy to hear that, Rara.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.560
Ponyville School Ponies!

10:42.720 --> 10:44.880
As part of the Helping
Hooves Music Festival,

10:44.880 --> 10:48.180
I'm holding a contest where
some of you will get a chance

10:48.180 --> 10:51.880
to sing with me on stage at the
concert tomorrow! Sound fun?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.180
All right! Now who
wants more Hoovsies?

10:59.140 --> 11:01.940
Now, that's more like
the Rara I remember.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.990
<i> But I got everything</i>
<i> you requested.</i>

11:05.320 --> 11:07.580
That was for
Countess Coloratura.

11:07.760 --> 11:12.400
This is for me. And what
I want is premium oats.

11:12.720 --> 11:16.340
Oh, well, we have lots of tasty
oats right here in Ponyville.

11:16.660 --> 11:19.240
I would not feed
those to a chicken!

11:19.560 --> 11:23.020
I want top-of-the-line,
Appaloosan Oats.

11:23.500 --> 11:27.560
Next. It appears that we are
surrounded by apple trees.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.660
Bring me 500 pre-peeled,
pre-cored apples.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.200
And I want those
things in 24 hours!

11:34.360 --> 11:35.820
But that's impossible!

11:36.040 --> 11:38.700
Do you want me to pull
Countess Coloratura

11:38.700 --> 11:43.400
from your little podunk
charity show? Because I will.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.600
Applejack! Svengallop just
made all of these new demands

11:48.900 --> 11:51.000
I heard, Pinkie.
But don't you fret.

11:51.320 --> 11:53.480
I'll talk to Rara and
fix things right up.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.180
Did you see, sis? Did you see?

11:58.440 --> 12:01.110
Is this the little sister
you wrote to me about, AJ?

12:01.440 --> 12:07.190
Hold on, Applejack! You wrote to
Countess Coloratura...about me?

12:07.190 --> 12:11.120
AJ said you were the best little
sister ever, Apple Bloom.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.430
All right now, you best
git along, little ponies.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.660
Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk
to you about your manager?

12:25.880 --> 12:27.110
Sure, what about him?

12:27.360 --> 12:30.180
Well, while you were meetin'
with the school ponies,

12:30.460 --> 12:33.350
he was demandin' all sorts
of stuff from Pinkie Pie.

12:33.540 --> 12:36.240
Svengallop works very
hard as my manager, AJ.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.240
So if he needs some things
when we're on the road,

12:39.240 --> 12:41.040
I don't see anything
wrong with that.

12:41.340 --> 12:43.640
Well, do you see something
wrong with him telling Pinkie

12:43.640 --> 12:45.990
that if she doesn't get
those things by tomorrow,

12:46.140 --> 12:48.190
he'd pull you from
our charity festival?

12:48.580 --> 12:51.600
What? But...he knows how
important charity is to me

12:51.600 --> 12:54.300
and leaving the festival would
completely ruin my image!

12:54.600 --> 12:58.100
I'm afraid Svengallop doesn't
give a pickled Pippin

12:58.100 --> 12:59.340
about your charity work.

12:59.660 --> 13:00.760
That's not true!

13:00.920 --> 13:03.380
Svengallop has always supported
me in all my interests.

13:03.580 --> 13:05.410
You're just saying those
things because you're jealous.

13:05.740 --> 13:09.300
Jealous of what? A pony who
hides behind a veil so thick

13:09.300 --> 13:11.250
she can't see when
somepony's using her?

13:11.520 --> 13:14.050
No, I'm not jealous
of that, Rara.

13:14.300 --> 13:17.660
I am not Rara! I am
Countess Coloratura!

13:17.960 --> 13:20.290
And while we may have been
friends when we were young,

13:20.560 --> 13:22.860
we have clearly gone in
different directions!

13:32.680 --> 13:33.910
It just ain't right!

13:34.200 --> 13:37.010
He's manipulatin' her and
she's just not seein' it.

13:37.340 --> 13:39.160
Enough stewing! More peeling!

13:40.980 --> 13:43.100
Sorry, Pinkie, but
there is no way

13:43.100 --> 13:45.040
I'm lettin' that
lousy Svengallop

13:45.040 --> 13:46.620
use my friend like that!

13:47.600 --> 13:48.500
Ohhhh.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.260
Countess Coloratura!

13:52.740 --> 13:55.240
Wow, AJ! You said my real name.

13:55.540 --> 13:59.480
I said your new name, but I
saw the real you hangin' out

13:59.480 --> 14:00.970
with those school
ponies yesterday.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.060
And I know somepony
that'd prefer

14:03.060 --> 14:05.200
if you stopped doin'
those little events.

14:05.580 --> 14:07.280
Oh, not this again.

14:07.740 --> 14:09.920
C'mon, now. You just
gotta give me a chance

14:09.920 --> 14:11.210
to prove what I'm
sayin' is true!

14:11.580 --> 14:13.640
And just how are you
going to do that?

14:13.920 --> 14:17.960
Do exactly what I say; we'll
see if that Svengallop

14:17.960 --> 14:20.420
truly has your best
interests at heart.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.020
Svengallop? Svengallop?

14:25.400 --> 14:26.520
Where are you, Svengallop?

14:26.880 --> 14:29.600
Here I am. Did you
need something?

14:29.820 --> 14:32.260
Yes, I was...considering...

14:32.660 --> 14:36.100
maybe canceling the contest
with the school ponies?

14:36.540 --> 14:38.880
Countess, this is
wonderful!

14:39.020 --> 14:40.980
I've been waiting
forever for you to cancel

14:40.980 --> 14:42.780
that pointless
school pony contest!

14:43.280 --> 14:45.010
You...have?

14:45.360 --> 14:49.540
You do it at every charity event
and it does absolutely nothing

14:49.720 --> 14:53.640
to promote the Countess
Coloratura image that I built!

14:53.940 --> 14:55.260
Consider it CANCELED!

14:55.700 --> 14:56.800
Pinkie Pie!

14:57.560 --> 14:59.220
Yes, Svengallop, sir?

15:01.640 --> 15:05.280
We're making some adjustments
to the show. Follow me!

15:15.460 --> 15:17.060
Cancel the contest
for the fillies

15:17.060 --> 15:19.260
and schedule
me a spa treatment.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.620
Now that I don't have to oversee
a rehearsal with those brats,

15:22.840 --> 15:24.380
I have time for the works.

15:24.880 --> 15:25.820
You know the drill:

15:26.100 --> 15:29.720
deliver, or the diva
ditches your dippy charity.

15:31.940 --> 15:36.900
OK, Countess Coloratura!
All taken care of!

15:37.360 --> 15:38.380
<i> recording plays through PA:</i>
<i> You know the drill:</i>

15:38.570 --> 15:42.060
<i> deliver, or the diva</i>
<i> ditches your dippy charity.</i>

15:42.440 --> 15:44.820
So that's how you've
been managing things?

15:45.580 --> 15:47.740
Yeah, so? What's the problem?

15:48.040 --> 15:50.120
The problem is that
you've been using my name

15:50.120 --> 15:52.300
to intimidate ponies
to get what you want.

15:52.460 --> 15:56.700
But I work incredibly hard for
you! I deserve everything I get!

15:57.100 --> 15:59.960
But not because you scare ponies
into thinking I won't perform

15:59.960 --> 16:01.380
for their charities otherwise!

16:01.600 --> 16:03.840
I would never do
that to my fans.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.700
Which is why you should have
known that I would never

16:06.700 --> 16:08.760
cancel the School
Ponies Contest!

16:09.040 --> 16:12.640
Hmm. All this charity and
school pony contest nonsense

16:12.840 --> 16:15.920
is just remnants of that
boring little Rara

16:15.920 --> 16:17.600
I met back in Manehattan.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.540
You clearly don't
understand the real me.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.620
That's a joke! I
made you somepony.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.260
What can you even do without me?

16:27.800 --> 16:32.420
Good luck, Countess
Coloratura! Good luck!

16:35.640 --> 16:38.160
Oh, Rara! I'm so sorry.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.730
Are you gonna be OK for
the concert tonight?

16:41.160 --> 16:45.080
Of course. After all,
the show must go on!

16:46.000 --> 16:48.340
Oh, my gosh, Rarity!
Svengallop's right!

16:48.500 --> 16:51.820
This is going to be a disaster!
I'm gonna be terrible!

16:52.140 --> 16:53.480
Can you give us
a minute, Rarity?

16:53.820 --> 16:54.570
Certainly.

16:57.140 --> 16:59.510
Now, why's it gonna
be so terrible?

16:59.880 --> 17:01.860
Because Svengallop was
in charge of everything!

17:02.100 --> 17:04.000
The lights! The
visuals! The sound!

17:04.100 --> 17:06.400
Without Svengallop,
I have nothing!

17:06.680 --> 17:08.480
Now, now. don't go
gettin' yourself

17:08.480 --> 17:09.940
into a tizzy there, Rara.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.260
Svengallop turned you
into Countess Coloratura

17:13.420 --> 17:15.720
and acted like your friend
so he could enjoy the perks

17:15.720 --> 17:16.860
that came with bein' a star.

17:17.360 --> 17:20.700
But the real perk of friendship
is gettin' to see your friend

17:20.700 --> 17:22.400
bein' true to theirself.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.070
And, Rara, when
you're simply yourself,

17:25.420 --> 17:28.380
you're the brightest star
I've ever seen shine!

17:35.640 --> 17:37.040
Good evening, everypony!

17:37.180 --> 17:40.440
Welcome to opening night of The
Helping Hooves Music Festival!

17:40.720 --> 17:43.100
Now it is my great honor
to introduce you to

17:43.100 --> 17:46.340
our headlining act,
Countess Coloratura!

17:48.200 --> 17:52.780
This song may be familiar, but
yet it's totally different.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.520
Kind of like me: Rara.

Thank you, everypony!

20:26.420 --> 20:29.620
When I arrived at the Helping
Hooves Music Festival,

20:29.620 --> 20:32.340
I had forgotten
who I really was.

20:32.820 --> 20:37.020
But then an old friend reminded
me what real friendship is about

20:37.020 --> 20:40.430
and she told me that if
I was true to myself,

20:40.860 --> 20:42.400
I couldn't go wrong.

20:42.860 --> 20:45.840
So, I have a very special
surprise for her.

20:46.380 --> 20:49.980
