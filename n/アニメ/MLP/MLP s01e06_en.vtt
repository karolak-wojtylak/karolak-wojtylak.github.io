WEBVTT

00:00.851 --> 00:03.534
Come on, Twilight. You can do it.

00:03.535 --> 00:05.355
Okay. Here goes...

00:10.181 --> 00:11.995
HA-HA! You did it!

00:12.364 --> 00:14.529
Growing magic. That's number 25.

00:14.530 --> 00:17.280
Twenty five different types of tricks and counting.

00:17.591 --> 00:20.335
And I think this is the best trick so far.

00:20.336 --> 00:22.321
Hello, Rarity.

00:22.322 --> 00:26.788
What's that? Oh, it's the nothing.
Just my awesome mustache.

00:27.419 --> 00:33.150
Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you
look, it's just for practice and it's gotta go.

00:33.404 --> 00:34.524
Wait!

00:36.525 --> 00:37.645
Rats.

01:15.209 --> 01:19.491
Twenty five, Twilight! Twenty five
different kinds of tricks and counting.

01:19.701 --> 01:24.497
I though unicorns are only supposed to have
a little magic that matches their special talents.

01:24.590 --> 01:28.636
True. For ponies whose talents are
for things like cooking or singing or math.

01:28.637 --> 01:31.840
But what if the unicorn's
special talent *is* magic?

01:31.841 --> 01:34.982
Like you, Twilight. And you know a ton of magic.

01:34.983 --> 01:39.012
Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are
lots of ponies right here in Ponyville...

01:39.013 --> 01:40.862
...that know just as much magic as me.

01:40.863 --> 01:41.900
Are you kidding?

01:41.901 --> 01:45.843
I don't think there's another unicorn in all
of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.

01:46.082 --> 01:49.135
Gangway! Coming through!

01:50.474 --> 01:53.749
Snips... Snails... Wh-What's going on?

01:54.274 --> 01:55.861
Why, haven't you heard?

01:55.862 --> 01:58.379
There is a new unicorn in town!

01:58.380 --> 02:03.636
Yeah! They say that she's got more magical
powers than any other unicorn ever.

02:03.882 --> 02:04.967
Really?

02:04.989 --> 02:08.085
Oh, no way. That honor goes to Twilight here.

02:09.038 --> 02:10.619
Where is this unicorn?

02:10.620 --> 02:13.572
Oh, she's in the town square. Come on!

02:13.573 --> 02:14.973
Yeah! Come on!

02:18.285 --> 02:20.531
Come on, come all!

02:20.532 --> 02:23.464
Come and witness the amazing magic...

02:23.465 --> 02:27.658
★☆★ ...of the Great and Powerful Trixie! ★☆★

02:31.829 --> 02:35.774
Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie...

02:35.775 --> 02:38.661
...performs the most
spectacular feats of magic...

02:38.662 --> 02:41.660
★☆★ ...ever witnessed by pony eyes! ★☆★

02:44.236 --> 02:47.047
My, my, my. What boasting.

02:47.048 --> 02:49.881
Come on! Nopony's as magical as Twi...

02:50.240 --> 02:52.001
Twi... Twi...

02:52.162 --> 02:55.081
Oh... H-Hey, Rarity, I...

02:55.451 --> 02:56.851
Mustache!

02:57.799 --> 03:00.461
There's nothing wrong with
being talented, is there?

03:00.462 --> 03:01.518
Nothin' at all.

03:01.519 --> 03:05.841
'cept when someone goes around showin' it off
like a schoolfilly with fancy new ribbons.

03:06.196 --> 03:08.828
Just because one has the ability
to perform lots of magic...

03:08.829 --> 03:11.140
...does not make one better than the rest of us.

03:11.141 --> 03:14.685
Especially when you got me around
being better than the rest of us.

03:15.951 --> 03:20.182
I mean... Yeah! Uh, Magic Shmagic! Boo!

03:21.280 --> 03:22.814
Well, well, well.

03:22.815 --> 03:26.217
It seems we have some
NEIGH-sayers in the audience.

03:26.218 --> 03:30.239
Who is so ignorant as
to challenge the magical ability...

03:30.240 --> 03:32.900
★☆★ ...of the Great and Powerful Trixie?! ★☆★

03:33.114 --> 03:38.633
Do they not know that they're in the presence
of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?!

03:39.652 --> 03:41.681
Just who does she think she is?

03:41.682 --> 03:43.984
Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is...

03:43.985 --> 03:45.105
Spike! Shhh...

03:45.451 --> 03:46.761
What? What's wrong?

03:46.762 --> 03:49.248
You see the way they reacted to Trixie?

03:49.419 --> 03:51.657
I don't want anyone thinking I'm the showoff.

03:55.905 --> 03:58.721
So, "Great and Powerful Trixie".

03:58.722 --> 04:01.158
What makes you think
you're so awesome anyway?

04:02.004 --> 04:07.568
Why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie
have magic strong enough to vanquish...

04:07.569 --> 04:10.400
★☆★ ...the dreaded Ursa Major. ★☆★

04:14.908 --> 04:18.014
-What?
-No way...

04:18.227 --> 04:22.973
When all hope was lost, the ponies
of Hooffington had no one to turn to.

04:22.974 --> 04:28.327
But the Great and Powerful Trixie
stepped in and, with her awesome magic...

04:28.328 --> 04:31.807
...vanquished the Ursa Major and
sent it back to its cave...

04:31.808 --> 04:34.541
★☆★ ...deep within the Everfree Forest. ★☆★

04:34.753 --> 04:37.443
Sooo sweet!

04:37.444 --> 04:38.576
That settles it.

04:38.676 --> 04:45.275
Trixie truly is the most talented, most
magical, most awesome unicorn in Ponyville.

04:45.276 --> 04:48.659
No! In all of Equestria!

04:48.720 --> 04:51.859
How do you know? You didn't see it!
And besides, Twi...

04:54.800 --> 04:58.493
It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers.

04:58.494 --> 05:02.231
Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville.

05:04.585 --> 05:06.805
Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie?

05:06.806 --> 05:10.078
Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians.

05:10.079 --> 05:13.466
Anything you can do, I can do better.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.620
Any takers? Anyone?

05:15.919 --> 05:17.651
Or is Trixie destined...

05:17.652 --> 05:21.577
★☆★ ...to be the greatest ★☆★
equine who has ever lived?

05:25.099 --> 05:27.917
Please! She's unbearable!

05:27.918 --> 05:30.265
You gotta show her. You just gotta!

05:31.177 --> 05:34.945
There's no way I'm gonna use my magic
now, Spike. Especially since...

05:35.536 --> 05:37.214
How about...

05:37.215 --> 05:38.335
YOU!

05:42.194 --> 05:44.239
Well, how about it? Hm?

05:44.240 --> 05:46.029
Is there anything you can do...

05:46.030 --> 05:48.945
...that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?

05:49.443 --> 05:50.563
I... I...

05:50.823 --> 05:52.775
Well, little hayseed?

05:52.776 --> 05:55.826
That's it! I can't stand for no more of this.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.294
You show her, AJ!

05:57.773 --> 06:00.141
Can your magical powers do this?

06:14.974 --> 06:16.589
Top that, missy.

06:16.590 --> 06:19.019
Oh, ye of little talent.

06:19.020 --> 06:22.867
Watch and be amazed of the magic of Trixie.

06:40.210 --> 06:44.367
Once again the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails.

06:44.368 --> 06:47.663
There is no need to go strutting
around and showing off like that.

06:47.664 --> 06:48.734
Oh?

06:48.735 --> 06:50.764
That's my job!

07:14.396 --> 07:18.385
The don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothing.

07:22.056 --> 07:26.535
When Trixie is through, the only
thing they'll call you is "loser".

07:37.673 --> 07:40.908
I think I'm gonna be sick.

07:41.158 --> 07:44.321
Seems like anypony with
a dash of good sense...

07:44.322 --> 07:47.651
...would think twice before
tussling with the Great Trixie.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.844
What we need is another
unicorn to challenge her.

07:54.845 --> 07:57.122
Someone with some magic of her own.

07:57.123 --> 08:01.064
Yeah! A unicorn to show
this unicorn who's boss.

08:01.065 --> 08:03.837
A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.025
Enough! Enough all of you.

08:07.026 --> 08:10.210
I take your hint, but Rarity
is above such nonsense.

08:10.211 --> 08:12.875
Rainbow Dash and Applejack
may behave like ruffians...

08:12.876 --> 08:15.570
...but Rarity conducts herself
with beauty and grace.

08:15.992 --> 08:17.736
Ooo, what's the matter?

08:17.737 --> 08:21.800
Afraid you'll get a hair out of place
in that rats nest you call a mane?

08:22.452 --> 08:24.625
Oh, it is ON!

08:25.384 --> 08:28.150
You may think you're tough with
all your so-called power...

08:28.151 --> 08:30.867
...but there is more to magic
than your brutish ways.

08:31.023 --> 08:33.683
A unicorn need to be more than just muscle.

08:34.397 --> 08:36.523
A unicorn needs to have style.

08:38.412 --> 08:41.446
A unicorn is not a unicorn
without grace and beauty.

08:43.632 --> 08:45.948
Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her.

08:45.949 --> 08:49.582
She's strong, she's beautiful, she's...

08:53.271 --> 08:56.165
QUICK! I NEED A MIRROR!
GET ME A MIRROR!

08:56.166 --> 08:59.456
What did she to my hair?!
I know she did something terrible to my hair!

08:59.912 --> 09:02.747
-Nothing!
-It's fine.
-It's gorgeous.

09:02.748 --> 09:04.148
It's green.

09:04.707 --> 09:05.827
What?

09:06.834 --> 09:10.785
No! Green hair?! Not green hair!

09:11.662 --> 09:14.042
Such an awful, awful color...!

09:14.844 --> 09:16.834
Well, I never...!

09:17.229 --> 09:19.398
Well, Twilight. I guess it's up to you.

09:19.736 --> 09:21.948
Come on. Show her what you're made of.

09:22.261 --> 09:24.710
What do you mean? I'm nothing special.

09:24.711 --> 09:27.004
Yes, you are! You're better that her.

09:27.005 --> 09:28.732
I'm not better than anyone.

09:29.585 --> 09:32.736
You think you're better than
the Great and Powerful Trixie?

09:32.737 --> 09:35.141
You think you have more magical talent?

09:35.142 --> 09:37.850
Well, come on. Show Trixie what you've got.

09:37.851 --> 09:39.814
Show us all.

09:39.992 --> 09:43.536
Who, me? I'm just run of the mill citizen of Ponyville.

09:43.622 --> 09:45.553
No powerful magic here.

09:45.746 --> 09:47.946
I... I think I can hear my laundry calling.

09:47.947 --> 09:49.067
Sorry, gotta go.

09:51.079 --> 09:52.479
Twilight?

09:53.161 --> 09:57.142
Once again the Great and Powerful
Trixie has proven herself...

09:57.143 --> 10:00.796
...to be the most amazing
unicorn in all of Equestria.

10:01.508 --> 10:04.159
Was there ever any doubt?

10:10.681 --> 10:14.388
Here's your smoothie you asked for.
With extra hay, just how you like it.

10:14.639 --> 10:17.873
Hmmm... Hay.

10:22.257 --> 10:23.415
Yes?

10:23.416 --> 10:27.313
Oh, tell us another story,
Great and Powerful Trixie.

10:27.475 --> 10:31.930
Yeah, tell us about how you
vanquished the Ursa Major.

10:33.593 --> 10:38.214
Trixie is far too exhausted from
performing feats beyond imagination.

10:38.519 --> 10:41.185
Begone with you until morning.

10:42.295 --> 10:45.289
Of course, Great and Powerful Trixie.

10:45.290 --> 10:48.615
Anything you say. We are at your beck and call.

10:50.476 --> 10:52.303
What are you two doing?

10:52.954 --> 10:55.700
-Just bringing the G&PT a...
-The what?

10:55.800 --> 10:57.980
The Great And Powerful Trixie.

10:57.981 --> 10:58.894
Sheesh...

10:59.094 --> 11:01.013
Just bringing her a smoothie.

11:01.014 --> 11:03.406
How can you fall for her lameness?

11:03.407 --> 11:04.708
She's just a showoff.

11:04.709 --> 11:05.765
Unlike Twilight...

11:05.766 --> 11:11.549
The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished
an Ursa Major. Can your Twilight claim that?

11:11.649 --> 11:12.799
Oh really?

11:12.800 --> 11:14.739
Were you guys actually there?

11:14.740 --> 11:17.539
Well, uh... no. But...

11:17.540 --> 11:19.897
But nothing! The proof is in the pudding!

11:21.876 --> 11:23.626
I like pudding.

11:24.978 --> 11:28.892
Look. Unless an Ursa Major comes waltzing up
the street for Trixie to vanquish...

11:28.893 --> 11:32.388
...I am not gonna believe a word she says.
And neither should you!

11:33.695 --> 11:36.220
And Ursa walking up the street, ay?

11:36.221 --> 11:38.917
Snails! You thinking what I'm thinking?

11:38.918 --> 11:43.677
Why is it they call it a flea market
when they don't really sell fleas?

11:43.794 --> 11:45.194
Yeah, uh...

11:45.400 --> 11:46.800
Oh, come on!

11:51.533 --> 11:54.701
Twilight, would you put down
that book and just listen to me?

11:54.702 --> 11:57.527
Didn't you see how they hated
Trixie's bragging, Spike?

11:57.528 --> 12:01.425
If I go out there and show off my magic,
I run the risk of losing them as friends.

12:01.426 --> 12:05.922
It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'd be
using your magic to stand up for your friends.

12:05.923 --> 12:08.165
No, Spike. It's exactly the same.

12:08.166 --> 12:12.529
Come on, Twilight. Any one of these tricks, even
the tiniest, would be enough to show off Trixie.

12:12.530 --> 12:15.359
I don't wanna be seen as a bragger like Trixie.

12:17.999 --> 12:19.524
But you're the best!

12:19.971 --> 12:21.921
Please, Spike, I said no!

12:23.201 --> 12:25.862
If that's what you wanna be, then fine.

12:44.522 --> 12:50.126
Oooh... How we gonna find an Ursa Major when
I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?

12:50.127 --> 12:51.545
Hold on.

12:57.493 --> 12:59.204
Oh. That's better.

13:18.122 --> 13:19.968
Hey, guys. Where are you going?

13:20.810 --> 13:23.371
-Can't talk now...!
-Got a major problem.

13:23.453 --> 13:25.590
Yeah... Ursa Major, to be exact.

13:33.683 --> 13:35.965
TRIXIE!!!

13:35.966 --> 13:37.377
Twilight!

13:41.472 --> 13:44.978
Trixie! Come out! You gotta help!

13:45.477 --> 13:49.732
Trixie thought she said the Great and
Powerful Trixie did not wanna be disturbed.

13:50.754 --> 13:53.322
We... We have a... a tiny problem.

13:53.522 --> 13:55.949
Actually, it's a big one.

13:56.049 --> 13:59.806
What is so important that you cannot
wait until morning to disturb Trixie?

14:15.986 --> 14:17.545
Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!

14:17.546 --> 14:20.481
I've already told you, Spike.
I don't wanna show off Trixie.

14:20.482 --> 14:22.619
No, you don't understand. It's...

14:24.931 --> 14:27.074
Uh, is that what I think it is?

14:27.274 --> 14:28.674
Majorly.

14:28.977 --> 14:32.262
Great and Powerful Trixie,
you've got to vanquish the Ursa!

14:32.354 --> 14:35.010
Yeah! Vanquish so we can watch.

14:35.385 --> 14:38.100
It took a lotta trouble to get that thing here.

14:38.239 --> 14:40.459
Wait! You brought this here?!

14:41.026 --> 14:43.184
Are you out of your little pony minds?

14:43.285 --> 14:45.428
But you're the Great and Powerful Trixie.

14:45.429 --> 14:49.171
Yeah, remember? You defeated an Ursa Major.

14:51.898 --> 14:53.538
Uh, okay.

14:54.386 --> 14:55.510
Stand back.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.535
Piece a cake.

15:07.211 --> 15:09.008
Oh, come on, Trixie.

15:09.009 --> 15:12.108
Stop goofing around and vanquish it, eh?

15:22.019 --> 15:23.980
Well, that was a dud.

15:23.981 --> 15:25.481
Yeah, pfft... Come on!

15:25.482 --> 15:29.584
Where's all the cool explosions and smoking?
Stuff like earlier, you know.

15:52.258 --> 15:53.675
What's going on?

15:54.204 --> 15:56.160
We brought an Ursa to town.

15:56.161 --> 15:57.936
You WHAT?!

15:57.937 --> 16:01.439
Don't worry, the Great and
Powerful Trixie will vanquish it.

16:02.184 --> 16:03.543
I can't.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.200
WHAT?!

16:05.542 --> 16:07.257
Oh, I can't, I never have...

16:07.258 --> 16:10.997
No one can vanquish an Ursa Major. I just
made the whole story up to make me look better.

16:11.102 --> 16:13.177
MADE IT UP?!

16:59.077 --> 17:00.897
Nice use of number 16.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.034
Call me, dontcha know?

17:23.445 --> 17:24.845
That's new.

18:01.692 --> 18:03.481
Unbelievable!

18:04.199 --> 18:06.019
That was amazing!

18:06.231 --> 18:10.294
Heavens to Betsy! We knew
you had ability but not that much.

18:10.451 --> 18:13.533
I'm sorry. Please, please, don't hate me.

18:13.820 --> 18:15.220
Hate you?!

18:15.328 --> 18:17.522
Why, what ever do you mean, darling?

18:17.837 --> 18:22.782
Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's
showing off with her magic tricks and I just thought...

18:22.783 --> 18:26.054
Whoah, whoah, whoah.
Magic's got nothing to do with it.

18:26.055 --> 18:29.505
-Trixie's just a loud mouth.
-Most unpleasant.

18:29.506 --> 18:31.326
All hat, no cattle.

18:31.445 --> 18:34.418
So... you don't mind my magic tricks?

18:34.419 --> 18:38.895
Your magic is a part of who you are, sugar cube.
And we like who you are.

18:38.896 --> 18:42.288
We're proud to have such a powerful,
talented unicorn as our friend.

18:42.825 --> 18:46.585
And after whupping that Ursa's
hind quarters we're even prouder.

18:46.785 --> 18:47.905
You are?

18:50.293 --> 18:53.402
Wow, Twilight! How'd you know
what to do with that Ursa Major?

18:53.702 --> 18:55.980
That's what I was doing when
you came looking for me.

18:55.981 --> 19:00.134
I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that
I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.

19:00.352 --> 19:03.889
So it is possible to vanquish
an Ursa Major all by yourself?

19:03.890 --> 19:07.389
That wasn't an Ursa Major.
It was a baby. An Ursa Minor.

19:07.390 --> 19:09.030
THAT was just a BABY?!

19:09.031 --> 19:13.121
And it wasn't rampaging. It was just
cranky because *someone* woke it up.

19:15.475 --> 19:17.631
If that was an Ursa Minor...

19:18.104 --> 19:20.654
...then what's an Ursa Major like?

19:27.562 --> 19:29.093
You don't wanna know.

19:29.094 --> 19:32.044
Huh! You may have vanquished an Ursa Minor...

19:32.045 --> 19:35.497
...but you will never have the
amazing showstopping ability...

19:35.498 --> 19:38.190
★☆★ ...of the Great and Powerful Trixie! ★☆★

19:41.228 --> 19:42.670
Why, that little...

19:42.997 --> 19:44.248
Just let her go.

19:44.968 --> 19:47.055
Maybe some day she'll learn her lesson.

19:49.111 --> 19:51.074
Now, about you two.

19:51.878 --> 19:54.391
Oh, we're sorry that we woke up the Ursa Minor.

19:54.392 --> 19:57.697
We just wanted to see some AWESOME magic.

19:57.698 --> 20:02.486
Yeah! And the way you vanquished
that Ursa Minor was AWESOME!

20:05.315 --> 20:08.619
We deserve whatever punishment you give us.

20:09.110 --> 20:11.745
For starters, you can clean up this mess.

20:12.219 --> 20:16.780
And... What do you think, Spike?
Should I give them number 25?

20:17.401 --> 20:19.803
Oh, twenty five, yes.

20:19.804 --> 20:21.985
And I think I deserve it too.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.086
I think you're right.

20:31.690 --> 20:34.029
Sweet!

20:35.215 --> 20:37.035
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:37.396 --> 20:40.639
"I have learned a very valuable
lesson about friendship."

20:40.640 --> 20:45.171
"I was so afraid of being thought of as
a showoff that I was hiding a part of who I am."

20:45.371 --> 20:49.030
"My friends helped he realize that
it's okay to be proud of your talents."

20:49.130 --> 20:51.914
"And there are times when it's
appropriate to show them off."

20:51.920 --> 20:54.203
"Especially when you're
standing up for your friends."

20:54.204 --> 20:58.921
So, you finally admit that you're the most
talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?

20:58.992 --> 21:01.009
Well... yeah.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.957
But it's nothing to brag about.

21:03.184 --> 21:05.357
So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?

21:05.950 --> 21:08.461
Eh... She didn't go for the mustache.

21:08.765 --> 21:12.822
You know, Spike, that mustache has
nothing to do with who you really are.

21:12.922 --> 21:15.722
Maybe you should just try being yourself?

21:15.771 --> 21:16.777
Or...

21:16.778 --> 21:20.942
Maybe the mustache wasn't enough?
Maybe if I had a mustache AND a beard...?

21:21.361 --> 21:23.379
Ugh... Not this again.

21:23.707 --> 21:27.015
Okay. Imagine me with a nice,
long Fu Manchu-type beard.

21:27.016 --> 21:29.816
Or maybe a goatee? Oh, no. A soul patch...

21:30.448 --> 21:33.948
