WEBVTT

00:04.104 --> 00:09.308
Silverstream: Ah! See? New posters!
We never had those underwater!

00:11.612 --> 00:13.745
I won't keep you in
suspense any longer.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.714
We're bringing one of
Ponyville's oldest traditions

00:15.816 --> 00:18.450
to our school!
The Fetlock Fete.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.085
The what-lock-what?

00:20.187 --> 00:22.988
It's a pony dance party!
They're the best.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.089
I'm ready!

00:26.394 --> 00:28.360
You don't need to
do that, Ocellus.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.262
This year, the
event's at school

00:30.364 --> 00:32.031
and open to everycreature.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.933
We're calling our
dance the "Amity Ball".

00:35.035 --> 00:36.201
Even better!

00:37.805 --> 00:41.040
Yona not know
"Amity Ball" dance.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.775
Yona only know traditional
dance of Yakyakistan.

00:43.877 --> 00:44.776
Go like this.

00:47.949 --> 00:49.314
Ball dance like that?

00:52.353 --> 00:55.020
Not exactly. It isn't
just one dance;

00:55.122 --> 00:58.624
it's a whole night of 'em!
Plus an awesome party!

00:59.126 --> 01:01.460
And we'll have all the old
Fetlock Fete traditions!

01:01.562 --> 01:03.929
The Pony-Pal contest,
the Lucky Pot Dinner...

01:04.050 --> 01:05.051
You'll love it!

01:05.133 --> 01:08.834
So like this says, "Get your
Pony-Pal and come along!"

01:09.336 --> 01:11.436
Wanna go? I got
nothing better to do.

01:11.538 --> 01:14.139
You had me at "Dinner."

01:15.910 --> 01:18.477
Now, who wants to help
me hang more posters?

01:18.579 --> 01:19.411
ME!

01:19.513 --> 01:20.245
Sure!

01:24.585 --> 01:27.553
Hey Yona, want to
be my Pony-Pal?

01:27.655 --> 01:29.522
We can enter the
contest together...

01:30.224 --> 01:33.024
But Yona yak.
Yona not pony.

01:33.226 --> 01:34.026
So?

01:34.428 --> 01:37.062
Pony. Pony. More Pony.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.997
Aw, that's just a poster.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.001
C'mon, it'll be tons of
fun together! Promise.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.937
OK. Yona go with Sandbar.

01:45.339 --> 01:48.573
Great! I'll get the
tickets. See you later!

01:48.675 --> 01:50.042
Ha ha ha ha !

01:50.144 --> 01:54.414
Yona not let Sandbar down!
Yak best at being Pony-pal!

01:55.616 --> 01:59.685
But Yona not sure
how if she not pony...

02:01.355 --> 02:03.755
Oh! Terribly sorry, Yona.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.591
All these dresses I'm
sewing for the dance

02:05.693 --> 02:07.693
have me completely frazzled!

02:08.395 --> 02:11.530
Dress? Yona need
dress for dance!?

02:11.632 --> 02:15.233
Yona have lots to learn
about being best Pony-Pal!

02:53.707 --> 02:56.208
[sewing machine humming]

02:56.310 --> 02:57.142
[knock at door]
Ah!

02:57.244 --> 02:58.944
Yona interrupting?

02:59.246 --> 03:02.447
Oh! Ha ha! Well, not
interrupting exactly.

03:02.549 --> 03:03.949
More like blocking the flow...

03:04.051 --> 03:05.417
stopping me from what I'm doing..

03:05.519 --> 03:07.486
So, yes, interrupting.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.353
Ha ha.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.656
Now... what can I
do for you, Yona?

03:10.958 --> 03:14.359
Yona not know yak need
special pony dress for dance.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.662
Yona no can wear what
Yona always wear?

03:17.464 --> 03:19.798
Yona could. I
mean, you could.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.100
But the Fetlock Fete,

03:21.202 --> 03:23.368
or whatever
Twilight is calling it,

03:23.570 --> 03:25.070
it's all about a tradition.

03:25.272 --> 03:28.140
There's a certain way to do
everything at the dance.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.609
Yes! That what
Yona want to learn!

03:30.711 --> 03:35.547
How to do all the Pony things.
Even if Yona has to wear dress.

03:35.749 --> 03:39.084
Well, er.. if that's
what you really want.

03:39.286 --> 03:43.021
Mm hm! Yona be best
Pony-pal for Sandbar!

03:44.525 --> 03:48.293
In that case, at an elegant
affair like a Pony dance,

03:48.495 --> 03:51.730
one must converse in a
sophisticated fashion.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.132
Talking with Brussels
sprouts in your mouth

03:54.234 --> 03:57.502
helps you learn to <i>articulate</i>.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.273
Take a mouthful and
repeat after me.

04:01.375 --> 04:04.243
"How kind of you
to ask me to tea!"

04:08.415 --> 04:11.516
"May I offer you
a glass of punch?"

04:15.322 --> 04:18.624
"The weather is quite
agreeable today."

04:26.967 --> 04:29.768
Yona like Brussels sprouts!

04:30.070 --> 04:30.969
Let's move on.

04:32.173 --> 04:34.573
We will need to do something
about your hair style,

04:34.675 --> 04:37.943
but first, let's
find the right dress.

04:39.245 --> 04:42.714
Now...purple taffeta,
frosted chiffon,

04:42.916 --> 04:46.485
[gasp] gold brocade,
one of my favorites.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.620
Yona like brown.

04:47.822 --> 04:52.791
Blech. Earth tones. They're so... heh..
earthy, aren't they?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.426
Don't worry; we
shall find something

04:54.528 --> 04:55.861
to make you stand out.

04:56.363 --> 04:59.131
Yona not want to stand
out. Yona want to fit in.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.534
Ah. Quite. And by the
time we're through,

05:02.636 --> 05:04.503
it'll be like you've
been going to pony dances

05:04.605 --> 05:05.704

06:58.285 --> 07:01.520
Oh, Yona already
have Pony-Pal.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.222
Oh not that, darling.
The DANCING!

07:04.324 --> 07:06.858
And I know precisely
who can help.

07:09.897 --> 07:13.799
Uh, Rainbow Dash and
Fluttershy good at dancing?

07:14.101 --> 07:17.736
Don't be so surprised! I'm
awesome at EVERYTHING!

07:18.238 --> 07:19.805
Except for baking.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.606
There are two traditional dances

07:21.708 --> 07:23.809
that everypony does at the Fete.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.677
After a few days of
practicing with us,

07:25.779 --> 07:27.145
you'll know them both.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.513
And fit right in!

07:28.615 --> 07:31.283
Absolutely. We'll start
with the slow dance,

07:31.385 --> 07:34.486
the Pony Cotillion. That's
Fluttershy's specialty.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.790
Oh, heh, I wouldn't say
specialty; it's just fun!

07:39.092 --> 07:41.560
Here, Yona. I made you a chart.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.298
All you have to do is
follow these dance steps.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.099
You'll learn
them in no time.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.739
Now. Just start walking.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.746
Step on whatever color
I name. Let's begin.

08:00.948 --> 08:04.583
Blue. Red. Step ahead
Green, black, now step back.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.951
Now you try!

08:06.453 --> 08:10.455
Blue. Red. Step...Oop.
No. Yona start over.

08:10.557 --> 08:11.556
Blue, red,

08:11.658 --> 08:13.925
Green, black...
Yak step back?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.794
Good! Now...

08:15.896 --> 08:17.595
Black, green, red and blue

08:17.697 --> 08:19.364
Red, black, hold one and two...

08:19.466 --> 08:21.266
Red. Blue. Red
once more.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.268
Green black blue
red three and four!

08:23.370 --> 08:24.469
Agh!

08:24.571 --> 08:27.305
Yona feel like she
have four front feet!

08:32.780 --> 08:36.381
Oh.. Um, maybe we should
try this again later.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.784
Don't worry, Yona!
That was the hard one!

08:39.886 --> 08:41.619
Mine's WAY easier.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.927
A little dance called
the "Pony-Prance."

08:49.329 --> 08:51.362
The key to this one is SPEED!

08:56.537 --> 08:58.069
Come on, Yona! Try it!

08:58.271 --> 09:02.073
Just get with the flow
and let yourself GO!

09:10.050 --> 09:11.015
Oh, my!

09:12.252 --> 09:13.284
Whoa, there!

09:15.689 --> 09:18.089
Yona LIKE to flow and go!

09:27.434 --> 09:29.601
Welcome to Sweet
Apple Acres, Yona!

09:29.803 --> 09:31.102
Rarity tells us
ya need some help

09:31.204 --> 09:32.571
getting ready for
the big dance.

09:32.773 --> 09:36.441
SOME! Ha! Indeed. And we only
have a few more days.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.510
Well, you've come
to the right place!

09:38.612 --> 09:40.879
Because if you ask me what my
favorite part of the dance is,

09:40.981 --> 09:45.150
I'd say everything about the
dance, but especially...this!

09:45.452 --> 09:47.519
The Fetlock Lucky
Pot Dinner!

09:47.821 --> 09:49.921
It's part of the
Ponyville dance tradition.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.890
Everypony brings
a dish to share,

09:52.192 --> 09:54.259
and we swap 'em without
knowin' whose is whose.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.262
Although my Lucky Pot
probably gives me away. Heh.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.664
You can cook
anything you want!

09:59.766 --> 10:03.469
But can I suggest... oh, I
don't know maybe.. CUPCAKES!?

10:03.971 --> 10:06.938
Er. I already told Yona a little
bit about that tradition.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.507
She's even brought her
own Lucky... bucket.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.810
Yak buckets are best buckets.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.080
Yona think make
traditional Yak dish.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.581
Tree Root Stew.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.853
Extra fiber! Mmm!
Ponies like?

10:21.155 --> 10:22.521
Hm. I'm not sure!

10:22.623 --> 10:26.224
So, just in case,
let's get baking!

10:29.329 --> 10:30.862
Flour, milk, sugar,
butter icing.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.864
Then we mix and we beat
and we pour into pans

10:32.966 --> 10:33.632
and we bake!

10:34.935 --> 10:36.134
And now YOU try it!

10:39.172 --> 10:40.705
Achoooo!

10:41.408 --> 10:43.208
Well, that's one way to mix it.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.210
Let's try something
a little simpler.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.612
I'm sure we can do
something with these.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.017
OK! Applesauce it is.

10:54.721 --> 10:57.656
Blue...red...green...blue....!

11:22.049 --> 11:25.383
[muffled] How kind of you
to ask me to tea!

11:34.361 --> 11:39.497
[slowly] How kind of you
to ask me to tea!

11:46.139 --> 11:47.872
Blue. Red. Step ahead.

11:47.974 --> 11:51.977
How kind of you. Green,
black, Yona step back.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.379
...to ask Yona to tea.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.247
Black, green, red and blue

11:56.349 --> 11:58.182
Red, black, hold one and two.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.251
Red. Blue. Red once more.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.120
Green black blue
red three and four!

12:02.422 --> 12:05.023
Look! She's dancing!

12:05.125 --> 12:07.659
How 'bout that?
And she's good!

12:08.361 --> 12:11.529
Yona! If someone at the party
tells you they're thirsty,

12:11.831 --> 12:12.764
you say...?

12:13.066 --> 12:19.037
May Yona, um, may <i>I</i>
offer you a cup of punch?

12:19.539 --> 12:21.606
By Celestia, I
think she's got it!

12:21.708 --> 12:23.441
She's really got it!

12:23.543 --> 12:25.076
Yona, you did it!

12:25.178 --> 12:26.911
You dance great!

12:27.013 --> 12:29.514
And are so well-spoken!

12:29.616 --> 12:31.717
You'll be the hit of the Ball!

Hello, everycreature! I'm
your DJ Scales N' Tail,

12:57.711 --> 13:00.011
spinning your favorite
tunes all night long.

13:00.213 --> 13:04.048
So welcome to the Fetlock
Fe--I mean, the Amity Ball!

13:14.895 --> 13:16.829
I'm just glad I'm
here with you guys.

13:17.831 --> 13:20.331
At least I'm not the only
non-pony in the crowd.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.567
You're not still worried
about that, are you?

13:22.769 --> 13:24.536
Like Headmare Twilight said,

13:24.738 --> 13:27.005
This is a dance
for everycreature.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.873
There's no
"pony pressure."

13:31.478 --> 13:33.678
You should have
told Yona that.

13:34.080 --> 13:34.946
What do you mean?

13:35.048 --> 13:36.098
Didn't you hear?

13:36.299 --> 13:39.149
Our teachers have been helping
her get ready for the dance.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.285
She's been taking lessons.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.390
She's gone full
pony for the dance.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.591
All for you...

13:47.627 --> 13:49.794
For me? Why?

13:50.196 --> 13:55.133
How kind of you to ask me
to this soiree, Sandbar.

14:00.106 --> 14:02.272
Woah..!
Er..
What?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.175
You look
so... weird!

14:04.577 --> 14:05.244
Yona..?

14:05.646 --> 14:10.348
Quite. Oh, I do hope I make
a good pony-pal for you.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.284
Uh.. Of course you do!

14:13.786 --> 14:17.222
But Yona, you didn't need
to do any of...this.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.791
And why are you
talking so funny?

14:20.193 --> 14:24.863
I am not talking
funny. I'm fitting in.

14:25.665 --> 14:26.798
Could've fooled me.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.536
Yona! You look absolutely
scrumptious, darling!

14:33.073 --> 14:34.639
Why don't I get that for you?

14:37.744 --> 14:39.210
You made a
Lucky Pot?

14:39.412 --> 14:42.213
Precisely like ponies prepare!

14:43.299 --> 14:45.582
Welcome, everycreature
to our school's

14:45.685 --> 14:47.919
first annual Amity Ball!

14:48.121 --> 14:50.555
For those of you who've never
attended a Fetlock Fete,

14:50.757 --> 14:53.157
we can't wait to show you
some of our fun traditions

14:53.259 --> 14:54.559
on this special night.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.964
So Spike...

14:59.566 --> 15:00.765
Er. Scales N' Tail?

15:01.067 --> 15:05.871
Uh, right. Scales N' Tail.
Let's get this party started!

15:06.773 --> 15:11.376
Oh, yeah, party ponies! It's
time to raise the roof

15:11.478 --> 15:14.345
and stomp your hoof for the
traditional first dance

15:14.447 --> 15:17.648
of the night...the
Pony Cotillion.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.193
Ah! Yona know this one.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.361
You do?

15:29.663 --> 15:34.365
Indeed! Green, black,
then step back. Shall we?

15:39.239 --> 15:40.704
Hee hee!
[chuckle]

15:43.643 --> 15:46.044
Wow! How did you learn this?

15:46.813 --> 15:49.080
I had good teachers.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.383
Whoa!

15:55.288 --> 15:57.489
Yona! Are you all right?

15:58.191 --> 16:00.458
Yona never practice
dance with dress on.

16:00.560 --> 16:06.364
Uh. I mean... heh, heh, may I offer
you a cup of punch?

16:07.734 --> 16:10.101
Spike: Time to shake
things up a little!

16:10.203 --> 16:13.904
That's right, everycreature,
it's the Pony Prance!

16:15.342 --> 16:17.609
Uh.. maybe we should
sit this one out.

16:17.911 --> 16:21.746
No! I do so LOVE
the Pony Prance!

16:21.848 --> 16:22.647
Whoa!

16:46.839 --> 16:48.006
Whoa!

16:48.208 --> 16:49.207
It's OK, Yona!

16:49.709 --> 16:50.942
Just stop bouncing!

16:51.044 --> 16:52.110
We got you!

16:55.615 --> 16:57.749
Wig...come...OFF!

16:58.451 --> 16:59.083
Huh?

17:07.427 --> 17:08.193
Ah!

17:09.562 --> 17:11.529
What a calamitous Yakciddent!

17:13.666 --> 17:14.399
Yona!

17:14.501 --> 17:15.366
What happened?

17:15.468 --> 17:16.701
Are you all right?

17:17.103 --> 17:22.673
No! Yona not all right!
Yona want to be alone!

17:33.920 --> 17:40.658
Yona sad. Yona sing
sad song. Sad Yona.

17:42.362 --> 17:46.732
Yona no blame bird. Yona no
want to be around Yona either.

17:47.834 --> 17:53.171
Yona sad, Yona sing sad song.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.405
Yona?

18:01.481 --> 18:03.281
How Sandbar find Yona?

18:03.583 --> 18:06.717
I know you pretty well by now.
I figured you'd come here.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.553
Besides, it's
where I'd go

18:08.655 --> 18:10.088
if something like
that happened to me.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.524
Sandbar mean something
awful and embarrassing!

18:13.626 --> 18:17.228
So awful, Yona cannot come
down from treehouse ever!

18:19.099 --> 18:21.132
Will Sandbar bring
Yona food and water?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.935
You know, it really
wasn't that bad.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.437
I don't think anycreature
hardly even noticed.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.341
Well, maybe one
or two didn't.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.477
If they happened to be in
Canterlot for the day.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.379
But anyway, it's
all over now.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.581
So, will you come back
to the dance with me?

18:39.518 --> 18:43.354
Yona disappoint Sandbar. Yona
not make very good pony.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.356
Why would you think
you disappointed me?

18:45.658 --> 18:48.293
And who said anything about
having to be a good pony?

18:48.695 --> 18:51.596
Yona just want to do all
the right pony things

18:51.798 --> 18:53.131
and fit in at dance.

18:53.633 --> 18:57.402
Then maybe Sandbar and Yona
win Best Pony-pals Contest.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.671
Instead, Yona win
Worst Pony Ever.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.374
That's not true.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.611
Really? Sandbar name two
ponies worse than Yona.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.379
Cozy Glow and Sombra.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.650
Hm. OK. Sandbar right.
They worse.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.685
Yona, it doesn't really
matter if you're a great pony

19:14.787 --> 19:18.356
or a horrible pony. You're
the best YONA I know.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.259
That's why I asked
you to the dance.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.193
Really?

19:22.595 --> 19:23.961
I never wanted you
to be anything

19:24.063 --> 19:25.363
other than
what you are.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.400
My friend,
Yona. The Yak.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.067
Agh!

19:30.969 --> 19:33.972
So, what do you say? Let's
go back to the dance?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.486
Don't worry.
I'm with you.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.356
We ALL are.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.392
Pinkie: Yona, are
you all right?

19:54.494 --> 19:57.261
We were so worried when
you disappeared like that!

19:57.363 --> 20:00.298
Yona fine. But Yona sorry.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.802
Not mean to make such a mess
and ruin the pony dance.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.370
It's not your fault, Sugarcube.

20:06.472 --> 20:07.938
It's the opposite!

20:08.040 --> 20:10.875
If anything, WE
should be apologizing.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.143
I thought we were
just teaching you

20:12.245 --> 20:13.645
how to have fun at the dance.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.182
We never meant to try to turn
you into something you're not.

20:17.984 --> 20:18.983
Is OK.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.085
Friend help Yona feel better.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.187
Twilight: And that's why we're
giving you this.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.326
No way! The Pony-Pal Prize!

20:28.828 --> 20:31.562
From now on, it's the
Annual Amity Ball Award

20:31.664 --> 20:32.797
for Friendship.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.765
No pony-ness required.

20:34.867 --> 20:38.269
We all decided that you and
Yona totally earned this.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.005
Your actions tonight

20:41.107 --> 20:43.774
exemplified the true
meaning of friendship.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.911
Congratulations, you two.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.786
Yona! I'm glad you're back.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.456
Everypony wants to learn
that crazy dance you did!

20:59.726 --> 21:02.527
Yak-Dance? Is easy. Yona teach.

21:02.729 --> 21:05.096
If everycreature
want to learn?

21:05.598 --> 21:06.964
It would be an honor.

21:08.534 --> 21:11.369
You asked for it and
DJ Scales N' Tail

21:11.471 --> 21:13.037
is gonna deliver!

21:13.139 --> 21:17.575
Everycreature join Yona for...
the Yakyakistan Stomp!
