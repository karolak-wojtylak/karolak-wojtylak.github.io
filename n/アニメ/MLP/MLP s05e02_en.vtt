WEBVTT

00:04.208 --> 00:05.573
As princess, I've
been chosen

00:05.595 --> 00:07.968
to spread the magic of
friendship across Equestria.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.688
So why would the
Tree of Harmony

00:09.764 --> 00:11.582
want us to sit in a
castle in Ponyville?

00:11.657 --> 00:13.106
This is incredible!

00:13.466 --> 00:15.146
It's got all of Equestria!

00:17.457 --> 00:19.555
Why are our Cutie Marks
over there?

00:19.746 --> 00:21.946
It seems like the map
wants us to find out.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.493
An entire village with
the same Cutie Mark?

00:24.657 --> 00:25.964
Welcome!

00:26.182 --> 00:28.342
This must be the
most pleasant place

00:28.364 --> 00:29.422
in Equestria!

00:29.568 --> 00:31.302
I'm delighted you're interested

00:31.320 --> 00:32.840
in our Cutie Mark vault.

00:33.173 --> 00:33.880
It's a trap!

00:33.906 --> 00:35.368
Aaah!

00:35.568 --> 00:38.088
Now you can spend the
rest of your lives here.

00:38.386 --> 00:41.297
Without your Cutie Marks!

00:47.648 --> 00:52.640
YayPonies Regular Subtitles.

01:17.648 --> 01:20.106
<i> In sameness,</i>
<i> there is peace.</i>

01:20.808 --> 01:23.164
<i> Exceptionalism is a lie...</i>

01:24.102 --> 01:26.453
<i> Free yourself from</i>
<i> your Cutie Mark...</i>

01:27.475 --> 01:30.195
<i> Choose equality as</i>
<i> your special talent...</i>

01:34.564 --> 01:36.315
Hey! This is pretty good!

01:39.044 --> 01:41.564
Ugh. We've got to find
a way out of here.

01:41.848 --> 01:43.888
I can't take much
more of that voice.

01:44.182 --> 01:46.235
Oh, this is horrible!

01:46.702 --> 01:50.057
There there, Rarity,
it's not so bad.

01:50.222 --> 01:52.484
Yes it is! Look at
those drapes!

01:52.697 --> 01:54.626
I have no idea if
they're tacky or not!

01:55.053 --> 01:57.080
Well, I think they're nice.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.026
So do I!

02:04.493 --> 02:05.960
Oh, thank goodness!

02:06.262 --> 02:08.040
Can you help us, little birdy?

02:10.542 --> 02:13.262
Go on, now. Fly away
and get us help.

02:16.204 --> 02:19.946
Oh! Even tweets don't
make sense anymore.

02:23.826 --> 02:26.844
Agh! This door's shut
tighter than a...

02:27.528 --> 02:28.480
summer of...

02:28.649 --> 02:30.415
of piglets in...

02:30.720 --> 02:34.475
Shoot, I can't even make
countryisms no more!

02:34.697 --> 02:37.613
I don't know, maybe it'll be
super fun to be all the same!

02:39.506 --> 02:40.306
Sort of.

02:40.568 --> 02:42.786
More pleasant than
fun, I guess.

02:43.195 --> 02:45.177
Something odd about
that staff.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.311
I haven't studied Eastern
unicorns as much as I should've,

02:48.404 --> 02:51.457
but I'm pretty sure Meadowbrook
only had eight magical items,

02:51.573 --> 02:52.462
not nine.

02:52.826 --> 02:55.017
And I don't remember any
of them being a staff.

02:55.488 --> 02:57.724
Well, it looks like you'll
have plenty of time

02:57.742 --> 02:59.093
to try to think about it.

03:02.413 --> 03:04.213
<i> Difference is frustration...</i>

03:04.937 --> 03:06.853
<i> To excel is to fail...</i>

03:07.546 --> 03:10.511
<i> Be your best by never</i>
<i> being your best...</i>

03:11.220 --> 03:13.400
<i>Conformity will set you free...</i>

03:14.404 --> 03:17.955
<i> Accept your limitations and</i>
<i> happiness will follow...</i>

03:18.746 --> 03:20.831
<i> You're no better</i>
<i> than your friends...</i>

03:20.924 --> 03:24.022
I'VE GOT IT! I know how
we can get out!

03:24.893 --> 03:27.973
Forget it, Twilight.
This door's not opening.

03:28.248 --> 03:31.506
And I'm afraid the windows are
much too small for escape.

03:31.675 --> 03:33.164
But there is a third way.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.084
Of course!

03:34.226 --> 03:36.008
Eventually the wind and weather
will wear down the walls

03:36.057 --> 03:36.955
until they start to crumble!

03:37.115 --> 03:39.137
Then all we have to do is wait
for a big enough hole to form

03:39.155 --> 03:40.200
and we can just walk out!

03:40.284 --> 03:41.791
It's the perfect plan!

03:42.826 --> 03:43.777
I guess...

03:44.395 --> 03:46.168
We don't actually
have to escape.

03:46.466 --> 03:47.773
They'll just let us
out when they think

03:47.795 --> 03:49.222
we've accepted
their philosophy.

03:49.764 --> 03:51.733
But they're never gonna
believe we switched over

03:51.751 --> 03:53.191
in just one night.

03:53.462 --> 03:55.551
There's one of us
they might believe.

03:58.795 --> 04:00.097
Ah! Me?

04:00.497 --> 04:03.182
You've been saying how great
this place is since we got here!

04:03.715 --> 04:05.688
That's because
everypony's so nice

04:05.733 --> 04:08.586
and their village is so
pretty and...and...

04:10.635 --> 04:11.751
Oh, you're right.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.982
They probably would
believe me.

04:14.373 --> 04:15.871
I hate to lie to them.

04:16.106 --> 04:18.386
They've been so
welcoming and friendly.

04:18.662 --> 04:21.875
Aside from locking us in here
and trying to brainwash us

04:21.893 --> 04:24.164
into abandoning the things
that make us special.

04:26.555 --> 04:28.626
OK. I'll do it.

04:29.022 --> 04:30.862
WOO-HOO!

04:31.626 --> 04:32.786
I mean, cool.

04:33.417 --> 04:35.635
But what do I do
once I'm out?

04:35.906 --> 04:38.275
You've got to find a way to
get our Cutie Marks back.

04:40.746 --> 04:42.751
Oh, good morning!

04:44.875 --> 04:47.435
I trust you had
a pleasant night.

04:48.311 --> 04:49.431
This way, please.

04:49.626 --> 04:52.613
There are some friends
who would like to see you.

04:55.284 --> 04:58.040
Gather 'round,
friends, gather 'round!

04:58.440 --> 05:01.573
We've come to ask if any of
you are ready to join us.

05:01.826 --> 05:04.533
There are so many friends to
be made, once you realize

05:04.551 --> 05:06.604
you don't need your
Cutie Marks

05:06.871 --> 05:09.164
or the talents that
come with them.

05:09.888 --> 05:12.973
We have a welcome
ceremony for new friends.

05:13.231 --> 05:17.333
The whole village joins together
to build you your own cottage.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.995
Not interested! You
may have them now,

05:20.102 --> 05:22.395
but we're going to get
our Cutie Marks back!

05:22.613 --> 05:24.226
Y'all don't understand, do ya?

05:24.453 --> 05:26.573
You can't force
nopony to be friends!

05:26.751 --> 05:27.840
It don't work like that!

05:28.213 --> 05:29.791
Please, join us!

05:29.822 --> 05:31.493
We love new friends!

05:31.804 --> 05:36.031
It's all right, everypony, this
is a perfectly normal part

05:36.053 --> 05:39.022
of the equalization process
for those who haven't...

05:39.840 --> 05:42.115
quite seen the light yet.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.102
We'll try again tomorrow,

05:44.257 --> 05:48.808
once you've had a bit more time
to consider our philosophy.

05:55.248 --> 05:56.880
I'd like to join!

06:01.831 --> 06:02.928
Fluttershy?

06:03.271 --> 06:04.551
How could you?

06:04.871 --> 06:07.160
If giving up my Cutie
Mark means I get to stay

06:07.182 --> 06:09.960
in this lovely village
with these lovely ponies,

06:10.271 --> 06:11.564
then I'll do it.

06:15.204 --> 06:17.426
We have a new
friend, everypony!

06:21.706 --> 06:24.222
There's one more
order of business.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.017
It seems some in
our midst might be

06:27.226 --> 06:29.631
dissatisfied with
the village life!

06:30.786 --> 06:33.711
Unfortunately, it's all
too true, my friends.

06:33.906 --> 06:37.000
Will you kindly tell us the
names of those friends

06:37.026 --> 06:39.524
who so desperately miss
their Cutie Marks

06:39.546 --> 06:42.804
that they would sneak
around in the shadows

06:42.826 --> 06:45.373
talking to
strangers about it?

06:46.124 --> 06:50.217
Just so we can be sure your
intentions are, indeed, pure.

06:55.484 --> 06:58.280
Um, I don't know
who they were.

06:58.542 --> 07:02.262
Um. I'm sorry, I don't know
your names and faces yet.

07:02.648 --> 07:06.724
Nonsense! Obviously these ponies
must have asked you directly.

07:06.986 --> 07:08.853
Kindly point them out.

07:15.075 --> 07:16.720
<i> It was me!</i>

07:17.786 --> 07:19.364
It was only me.

07:19.813 --> 07:21.728
I only wanted it back
for a little while.

07:22.368 --> 07:25.760
And you're quite
certain it was only you?

07:26.324 --> 07:28.720
I just wanted to remember
what it was like.

07:29.075 --> 07:32.311
And no thought to the pain
you'd cause your friends.

07:32.742 --> 07:35.142
Such selfishness.

07:37.382 --> 07:39.022
I'm sorry, everypony!

07:39.200 --> 07:40.915
I never wanted to
leave the village!

07:41.222 --> 07:42.884
I love all of--

07:46.911 --> 07:48.262
What was I thinking?

07:48.471 --> 07:50.702
I can't believe I even
considered asking

07:50.728 --> 07:52.275
for my Cutie Mark back.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.648
Don't worry, Fluttershy will
have us out of here in no time.

07:55.786 --> 07:57.760
Didn't you see what just
happened out there?

07:57.977 --> 07:59.631
Your friend has
accepted our way.

07:59.728 --> 08:01.271
You will all accept
our way.

08:01.351 --> 08:03.017
It's only a matter
of time!

08:07.057 --> 08:08.942
This guy's a
barrel of laughs.

08:09.328 --> 08:10.697
Laughs don't come in barrels.

08:10.853 --> 08:13.693
They come from inside you as
your body's response to delight.

08:14.724 --> 08:17.084
So what are we gonna do while
Fluttershy's out there

08:17.106 --> 08:19.853
lookin' for our Cutie Marks?

08:20.115 --> 08:22.240
We have to stay as
positive as we can.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.355
If Party Favor sees how much
we really do like each other,

08:25.484 --> 08:26.808
even though we're all different,

08:26.946 --> 08:28.795
maybe we can use him to
spread our message

08:28.817 --> 08:30.160
to the rest
of the village.

08:30.937 --> 08:33.053
<i> To excel is to fail...</i>

08:33.337 --> 08:36.191
Let's just hope they don't
convert any of us first.

08:38.133 --> 08:38.995
Welcome!

08:39.022 --> 08:39.991
Welcome!

08:40.071 --> 08:40.608
Welcome!

08:41.013 --> 08:44.351
Gosh, you really are the
nicest ponies I've ever met.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.604
Come, all new
friends stay with me

08:46.622 --> 08:48.444
until their cottage
is completed.

08:49.288 --> 08:51.640
Let's get you settled
and then you can enjoy

08:51.706 --> 08:54.537
all that our little
village has to offer.

09:13.217 --> 09:14.791
Get the Cutie Marks back.

09:15.048 --> 09:17.280
That's all you've got
to do, Fluttershy.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.493
Just sneak through the dark
to that spooky old cave

09:21.617 --> 09:25.257
with the scary magical staff
and get the Cutie Marks back.

09:27.195 --> 09:29.084
OK, you're doing great.

09:29.284 --> 09:31.213
The cave's got
to be close now.

09:33.666 --> 09:35.626
Excellent work,
Double Diamond.

09:35.955 --> 09:36.773
Of course.

09:37.235 --> 09:40.511
But I don't understand why you
wanted me to bring them here.

09:41.057 --> 09:44.986
Fluttershy is one of us now;
surely she can be trusted.

09:46.751 --> 09:48.902
This one belongs to a princess.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.017
It could be very
important to our cause.

09:52.306 --> 09:55.164
But if Twilight Sparkle
becomes our friend,

09:55.355 --> 09:58.080
then what do we care
about this old Cutie Mark?

09:58.320 --> 10:00.026
I just want to keep
them close.

10:00.048 --> 10:02.888
Until everything
is...settled.

10:03.306 --> 10:05.137
You may go, Double Diamond.

10:12.248 --> 10:12.955
Oh dear!

10:13.306 --> 10:16.177
How am I ever going to get
the Cutie Marks back now?

10:18.422 --> 10:19.235
Ow!

10:23.346 --> 10:25.604
Agh! Starlight,
you clumsy fool!

10:48.515 --> 10:49.346
Oh no!

10:52.791 --> 10:55.204
I've got a good
feeling about today!

10:57.311 --> 11:02.097
So...do any of you have
anything you'd like to say?

11:04.760 --> 11:06.177
Aw, a pity.

11:06.635 --> 11:10.040
Well, let's try this
again tomorrow, shall we?

11:11.120 --> 11:13.684
No new friends
today, I'm afraid!

11:15.720 --> 11:16.453
Wait!

11:16.740 --> 11:18.320
I'd like to lock them in.

11:19.577 --> 11:22.835
Marvelous, Fluttershy,
that's the spirit!

11:23.284 --> 11:26.413
Party Favor, will
you join us, please?

11:28.342 --> 11:29.991
I'm sorry, Starlight!

11:30.120 --> 11:31.911
I'm sorry, everypony!

11:32.035 --> 11:34.288
I've seen the error of my ways!

11:34.493 --> 11:37.142
I never want to look
at my Cutie Mark again!

11:37.497 --> 11:40.706
It seems there's cause
for celebration after all!

11:43.355 --> 11:44.875
They tried to break me!

11:45.146 --> 11:47.502
They wouldn't stop talking
about how different they are,

11:47.608 --> 11:50.191
and that somehow makes
their friendship stronger!

11:50.448 --> 11:52.937
Such backwards thinking.

11:53.231 --> 11:54.506
But I didn't listen!

11:54.751 --> 11:57.786
I knew what they were up
to and I didn't listen!

11:57.968 --> 11:59.875
Well done, Party Favor.

12:00.035 --> 12:03.266
We welcome you back
with open hooves.

12:03.533 --> 12:04.893
Um, Starlight?

12:05.235 --> 12:08.368
I think we might have one
more friend joining us today.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.480
Is this true?

12:13.204 --> 12:15.000
I...I think so.

12:15.297 --> 12:17.022
But I just want to be sure.

12:17.568 --> 12:19.884
If I agree to leave my
Cutie Mark in the vault,

12:20.195 --> 12:21.613
I'll really be happier?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.075
Just look around!

12:23.257 --> 12:25.471
Equality has given
us more happiness

12:25.515 --> 12:27.328
than you've ever known!

12:27.671 --> 12:29.635
And you wouldn't let me just
live here in the village

12:29.657 --> 12:31.257
with my old Cutie Mark?

12:31.568 --> 12:33.000
Out of the question.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.155
A pony with a different
Cutie Mark in our midst

12:35.217 --> 12:37.551
would destroy our
entire philosophy.

12:37.777 --> 12:39.920
We are all equal here!

12:41.524 --> 12:43.764
Then how do
you explain THIS?

12:46.520 --> 12:48.608
I knew you couldn't
be trusted.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.146
No! Get away!

12:58.324 --> 13:00.044
Wha..What are you looking at?

13:00.182 --> 13:02.146
They're the problem,
not me!

13:04.991 --> 13:06.897
How could you?

13:07.155 --> 13:09.435
You said Cutie
Marks were evil.

13:09.804 --> 13:13.671
You said special talents
led to pain and heartache.

13:13.862 --> 13:15.608
They do, don't you see?

13:15.808 --> 13:17.017
Look at them!

13:17.168 --> 13:17.977
Then why?

13:18.293 --> 13:20.817
Why did you take ours
and not give up your own?

13:21.191 --> 13:23.817
I..I had to, you fools!

13:24.000 --> 13:26.862
How could I collect your
Cutie Marks without my magic?

13:27.035 --> 13:29.160
But the staff has all
the magic we need!

13:29.311 --> 13:32.000
The staff is a piece of
wood I found in the desert!

13:32.210 --> 13:34.577
It's my magic that
makes all this possible!

13:34.777 --> 13:37.382
You'd all still be living
your miserable lives,

13:37.408 --> 13:39.840
thinking you're better
than everypony else,

13:40.102 --> 13:42.466
if it weren't for my
magical abilities!

13:42.777 --> 13:44.173
I brought you friendship!

13:44.288 --> 13:45.893
I brought you equality!

13:46.026 --> 13:48.222
I CREATED HARMONY!

13:48.515 --> 13:50.235
You lied to us!

13:50.404 --> 13:51.408
So what?

13:51.640 --> 13:53.448
Everything else I
said is true!

13:53.675 --> 13:56.973
The only way to be happy
is if we're all equal!

13:57.111 --> 13:58.804
Except for you.

14:00.648 --> 14:02.933
Everypony has unique talents
and gifts.

14:03.253 --> 14:05.448
And when we share them with
each other, that's how real--

14:05.484 --> 14:06.520
QUIET!

14:07.311 --> 14:09.515
You can't have that
Cutie Mark, Starlight.

14:09.866 --> 14:12.711
Either we're all equal
or none of us are.

14:24.693 --> 14:28.342
Come on, let's get
our Cutie Marks back!

14:28.440 --> 14:29.844
Yeah!

14:33.000 --> 14:33.648
Come on!

14:33.813 --> 14:35.608
Let's go get OUR
Cutie Marks!

14:35.942 --> 14:38.004
Our Cutie Marks
aren't in the vault.

14:38.302 --> 14:41.360
They're in there...with her!

14:47.342 --> 14:50.515
STAND BACK, EVERYPONY!

15:17.377 --> 15:21.253
Even without my Cutie Mark, I
can tell this is beautiful.

15:22.657 --> 15:25.493
They think they can come to
my village and disrupt my life?

15:26.271 --> 15:28.702
Let's see how they like spending
the rest of their lives

15:28.835 --> 15:31.351
without their
precious Cutie Marks!

15:42.213 --> 15:44.253
Stand back, everypony!

15:52.644 --> 15:53.577
They're gone!

15:53.795 --> 15:55.004
They were right over there!

16:06.071 --> 16:06.804
Look!

16:15.248 --> 16:17.035
She's headed for the pass!

16:17.493 --> 16:20.591
If she makes it into those
mountains, we'll never find her.

16:21.924 --> 16:23.693
These are amazing!

16:24.226 --> 16:25.982
There's a whole network
of caves up there.

16:26.146 --> 16:28.186
Your Cutie Marks
will be gone forever.

16:28.271 --> 16:29.977
Then let's get movin', y'all!

16:36.208 --> 16:38.022
Oh, come on!

16:41.955 --> 16:44.093
Are you all so willing to
give up everything

16:44.177 --> 16:46.297
because of these... strangers?

16:50.408 --> 16:52.253
We gave up everything for you!

16:52.413 --> 16:54.297
Because we thought
you were our friend!

16:56.302 --> 16:59.066
I can't believe we have to
count on these other ponies

16:59.106 --> 17:01.142
to save our Cutie Marks!

17:01.373 --> 17:02.995
If we hadn't come
here to help them,

17:03.137 --> 17:05.044
they'd still be living
under her rules!

17:05.333 --> 17:07.173
Now it's their turn to help us!

17:07.324 --> 17:09.204
And I know they can do it!

17:17.551 --> 17:18.942
My newest recipe!

17:19.355 --> 17:20.364
Snow pie!

17:46.311 --> 17:47.928
She's gonna get away!

17:50.600 --> 17:51.044
Whoa!

17:51.680 --> 17:53.471
These are my old skis.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.506
This is where I
first met Starlight.

17:57.746 --> 17:59.360
Maybe you can
reminisce another time.

17:59.431 --> 18:00.768
She's almost to the caves!

18:01.537 --> 18:03.400
Feel like an airdrop?

18:31.004 --> 18:32.422
Yee-haw!

18:32.657 --> 18:35.191
Finally, I can buck like
a five-bit snake herder

18:35.213 --> 18:36.928
in an Appleoosa
ranch house again!

18:37.351 --> 18:39.568
And you got your
countryisms back, too!

19:00.733 --> 19:02.928
I studied that spell for years!

19:03.075 --> 19:03.897
How can you--?

19:03.915 --> 19:07.342
I studied magic for years, too,
but what I didn't know then

19:07.395 --> 19:09.720
was that studying could
only take me so far.

19:10.128 --> 19:12.257
Each of my friends has taught
me something different

19:12.275 --> 19:13.257
about myself.

19:13.502 --> 19:16.297
It was their unique gifts and
passions and personalities

19:16.315 --> 19:18.404
that helped bring out the
magic inside of me.

19:18.653 --> 19:21.515
I never would have learned that
I represent the Element of Magic

19:21.528 --> 19:22.764
without these five.

19:23.066 --> 19:25.688
And I certainly wouldn't
be here to stop you now.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.835
Spare me your
sentimental nonsense.

19:28.155 --> 19:30.080
I gave these ponies
real friendships

19:30.182 --> 19:31.906
they never could
have had otherwise!

19:32.000 --> 19:33.382
How do you know that?

19:33.560 --> 19:35.728
You never even gave us a chance.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.804
She's getting away!

19:44.000 --> 19:45.791
We'll never find her in there.

19:46.271 --> 19:48.111
We just have to hope that
when she's had a chance

19:48.137 --> 19:48.986
to think it over,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.444
she realizes that you all
have taught her something.

19:51.862 --> 19:54.497
It's you who have
taught us something.

19:54.853 --> 19:57.351
We all came to this village
because we were searching

19:57.431 --> 19:59.191
for something missing
from our lives.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.506
We thought Starlight had
given it to us, but now...

20:02.933 --> 20:05.244
...now it seems it was
in front of us all along.

20:05.893 --> 20:06.866
It's us.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.284
Does that mean you'll
stay in the village?

20:10.613 --> 20:11.746
It's our home.

20:11.973 --> 20:13.662
I'm not going anywhere.

20:14.062 --> 20:18.057
This is a chance for all of us
to get to know each other again

20:18.248 --> 20:20.146
for the very first time.

20:20.342 --> 20:22.791
And I finally have a
chance to bake something

20:22.835 --> 20:24.813
besides terrible muffins!

20:38.764 --> 20:41.342
Now those are real smiles.

20:44.933 --> 20:46.573
I'll never get used to that.

20:46.866 --> 20:48.262
I think it's divine.

20:49.231 --> 20:52.088
Does that mean the map is
calling us somewhere else?

20:52.271 --> 20:55.008
I have a feeling it means
our work here is done.

20:55.311 --> 20:57.017
Looks like you were right, Twilight.

20:57.311 --> 20:59.333
The map did have a reason
for sendin' us here.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.288
We brought real friendship
to these here ponies.

21:02.546 --> 21:05.275
Guess that's why you're the
Princess of Friendship.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.382
But the map didn't send me.

21:07.528 --> 21:08.871
It sent us.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.951
You're a part of me, all of you,

21:11.208 --> 21:13.177
and there's no doubt you're
a part of my mission

21:13.191 --> 21:14.848
to spread friendship, too.

21:17.573 --> 21:18.862
This feels like an ending.

21:19.004 --> 21:20.804
It doesn't have to be
an ending yet, right?

21:21.097 --> 21:23.346
'Cause that Sugar
Belle can bake.

21:23.831 --> 21:26.146
Maybe we can stay a
little while longer.

21:26.306 --> 21:27.346
Come on!
