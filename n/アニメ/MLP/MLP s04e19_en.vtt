WEBVTT

00:03.235 --> 00:03.810
<i>I have to leave</i>

00:03.822 --> 00:05.266
<i>for dress rehearsal</i>
<i>soon, Rarity.</i>

00:05.373 --> 00:06.370
<i>Is it finished yet?</i>

00:06.803 --> 00:08.195
Ah, not quite.

00:08.452 --> 00:11.219
I still feel it needs a
certain je ne sais quoi.

00:11.578 --> 00:12.608
Perhaps it needs...

00:12.993 --> 00:14.263
appliques.

00:14.347 --> 00:14.946
Appliques?

00:16.351 --> 00:16.895
Or...

00:17.082 --> 00:17.859
sequins.

00:18.220 --> 00:18.842
Sequins!

00:23.896 --> 00:24.846
<i>Sweetie Belle.</i>

00:25.160 --> 00:27.707
I adore having you
help me, truly I do.

00:28.216 --> 00:28.827
But...

00:29.693 --> 00:31.631
Guess I got a
little carried away.

00:31.974 --> 00:34.440
It's just that I know how
important it is for you

00:34.452 --> 00:36.437
to finish this wardrobe in
time for Sapphire Shores

00:36.440 --> 00:37.767
and her backup dancers.

00:37.849 --> 00:40.762
This is without a doubt my
most prestigious order ever.

00:41.047 --> 00:44.160
After all, Sapphire Shores
is THE Pony of Pop

00:44.505 --> 00:47.471
and her Equestria-wide tour
launches in Canterlot next week,

00:47.908 --> 00:50.460
which means she must have these
outfits by day after tomorrow

00:50.474 --> 00:51.436
at the latest.

00:51.744 --> 00:52.536
But is there time?

00:52.854 --> 00:55.416
Barely. But I work
well under pressure.

00:55.793 --> 00:58.366
Mmm. As long as I stay
calm I'll be fine.

00:58.641 --> 00:59.855
Oh! Good!

01:00.023 --> 01:03.449
Then maybe you could check the
stitching and finish the buttons

01:03.453 --> 01:06.138
on the dresses I made for me,
Applebloom and Scootaloo?

01:06.544 --> 01:08.366
I really want them
to look perfect

01:08.376 --> 01:11.879
and I think I need
your expertise.

01:12.280 --> 01:16.337
My, you've been so much help to
me, how could I possibly say no?

01:16.770 --> 01:17.904
When do you need them?

01:18.200 --> 01:18.846
Tomorrow night.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.421
For the opening
night of our show.

01:23.075 --> 01:26.271
But Sweetie Belle darling,
I'm behind as it is.

01:27.635 --> 01:28.723
I understand.

01:30.599 --> 01:34.000
I suppose if I got a few
more ponies to help me,

01:34.011 --> 01:35.553
then maybe.

01:36.154 --> 01:37.840
Oh! Thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you!

01:37.853 --> 01:39.346
You're the best sister ever!

01:39.588 --> 01:40.940
The dresses are
right over there.

01:50.177 --> 01:52.177
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu</i>

02:24.831 --> 02:27.125
<i>My goodness girls,</i>
<i>it's time.</i>

02:27.258 --> 02:29.080
And the audience is
almost fully seated.

02:29.235 --> 02:30.208
Costumes!

02:31.463 --> 02:33.490
I can't believe Rarity
still isn't here

02:33.508 --> 02:34.673
with the costumes.

02:34.733 --> 02:36.530
She's been very
busy lately.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.591
But how can she
still not be here?

02:38.811 --> 02:40.515
She's known about
this for weeks.

02:42.595 --> 02:45.752
Uh, she has known about
this for weeks, right?

02:47.510 --> 02:49.373
I kept meaning to ask
her; I really did.

02:49.424 --> 02:51.518
But I worked so
hard on this play.

02:51.689 --> 02:53.617
I wrote it especially
for the three of us.

02:53.730 --> 02:54.507
I directed it!

02:54.612 --> 02:55.149
I'm in it!

02:55.291 --> 02:56.398
I made the costumes!

02:56.651 --> 02:58.979
It's just that this is
really my time to shine

02:58.983 --> 03:00.952
doing something
completely myself

03:01.184 --> 03:03.352
and I really wanted
to keep it that way.

03:03.726 --> 03:05.732
But we wanted everything
to be perfect.

03:05.984 --> 03:07.972
All our friends came
out to see it tonight.

03:08.296 --> 03:09.818
Places!

03:12.630 --> 03:14.280
Ah! I'm here. I'm here!

03:15.155 --> 03:16.031
You made it!

03:16.263 --> 03:18.702
I beg your pardon for
cutting it so close,

03:19.065 --> 03:21.607
but I made some improvements
to your original design

03:21.793 --> 03:24.983
and I had a terrible time
with these froofy sleeves.

03:25.346 --> 03:27.601
<i>It is for the first play</i>
<i>you ever wrote, after all.</i>

03:27.781 --> 03:30.083
So I made quite certain
it came out just so.

03:30.304 --> 03:32.411
Places? Hello?

03:52.062 --> 03:53.841
<i>Forsooth and anon.</i>

03:54.021 --> 03:57.244
<i>I cometh forthwith</i>
<i>and post haste</i>

03:57.498 --> 03:59.619
<i>with glad tidings, m'ladies.</i>

04:01.438 --> 04:03.923
Wow! A standing ovation!

04:04.130 --> 04:05.941
I still have goosebumps.

04:06.530 --> 04:08.491
This must be like a dream
come true for you,

04:08.503 --> 04:09.560
huh, Sweetie Belle?

04:09.685 --> 04:11.461
Ooh, can you imagine
if this show

04:11.475 --> 04:12.922
is how you got
your cutie mark?

04:13.151 --> 04:14.460
Which do you think
you'd get it for:

04:14.599 --> 04:16.641
<i>writing, directing or acting?</i>

04:19.549 --> 04:21.231
Let's not get carried away.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.334
We've got a whole lobby
full of friends waiting

04:23.340 --> 04:25.416
to shower us with
adoration and praise.

04:25.662 --> 04:26.749
Try to be gracious.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.530
Modest.

04:29.736 --> 04:30.602
Classy.

04:35.701 --> 04:37.830
Here we are! The
stars of the show!

04:39.621 --> 04:41.865
You may tell us how
much you loved it now.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.246
Line forms here.

04:43.535 --> 04:44.454
Wow, you guys.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.025
I think your sisters
would have loved it.

04:46.423 --> 04:47.482
Would have?

04:47.728 --> 04:49.662
They're sorry but they
had to go help Rarity

04:49.670 --> 04:51.500
get Sapphire Shores'
wardrobe ready

04:51.518 --> 04:52.794
to take to Canterlot
in the morning.

04:53.067 --> 04:54.433
Even Rainbow Dash?

04:54.835 --> 04:58.277
Yeah, Rarity fell
way behind.

05:00.189 --> 05:02.072
Aw, cheer up. The
show was great.

05:02.493 --> 05:03.482
I'll get you some punch.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.710
At least everypony else who
was able to stay loved it.

05:10.074 --> 05:11.147
What did you all like best?

05:11.201 --> 05:12.846
The writing, the
directing or the acting?

05:14.280 --> 05:17.120
Oh my, I loved
the dresses!

05:17.822 --> 05:20.255
I liked some of
those lines you said.

05:20.329 --> 05:21.920
Oh really? Which ones?

05:22.109 --> 05:24.011
I don't really remember,

05:24.040 --> 05:26.206
but you were wearing
a pink taffeta dress

05:26.212 --> 05:28.238
with lots of chiffon
when you said them.

05:28.446 --> 05:30.864
Hoo-whee, that
outfit was a dazzler.

05:31.239 --> 05:34.099
I liked that one almost as much
as the one with the lacy trim

05:34.175 --> 05:36.040
and all the embroidered
cuffs.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.828
<i>That was a nice one, too.</i>

05:38.450 --> 05:39.336
Grrrr.

05:39.463 --> 05:41.713
Isn't there anypony here
who remembers anything

05:41.724 --> 05:43.769
about the play
besides the dresses?

05:56.417 --> 05:58.526
All of this is
one headpiece?

05:58.620 --> 05:59.453
Indeed.

06:00.222 --> 06:02.667
This marvelous extravagance
is the creme de la creme

06:02.671 --> 06:04.109
of the entire wardrobe.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.975
But, alas, without this key
hidden stitch, it's just a...

06:10.368 --> 06:13.455
I'm trying to think of a
classy way to say "big bummer".

06:17.840 --> 06:21.410
Phew! Now perhaps we can all at
last take a moment to relax.

06:24.661 --> 06:26.251
Whatever's the
matter, Sweetie Belle?

06:26.439 --> 06:28.003
Didn't the play
go all right?

06:28.353 --> 06:29.562
Not even close.

06:29.734 --> 06:30.677
Oh dear!

06:30.846 --> 06:32.837
Was something amiss with
the dresses I made you?

06:33.049 --> 06:34.368
No. They were perfect!

06:34.503 --> 06:35.908
And that was the whole problem!

06:36.866 --> 06:37.621
Huh?

06:39.568 --> 06:43.799
Oh, um. I think maybe I'll go
take that moment to relax now.

06:44.997 --> 06:46.636
Sure do feel like relaxing.

06:47.159 --> 06:48.316
Right behind ya.

06:51.326 --> 06:52.585
How could you?

06:53.875 --> 06:55.642
"Ooh, what amazing
dresses."

06:55.767 --> 06:57.422
"Oh, how I loved the dresses."

06:57.619 --> 07:00.072
"Ooh, dresses dresses
dresses dresses."

07:01.791 --> 07:02.946
Oh, so they
did like them.

07:04.366 --> 07:06.255
You had me worried,
you silly filly.

07:06.503 --> 07:07.960
There. I knew it.

07:08.232 --> 07:09.683
You did this on purpose.

07:09.828 --> 07:11.843
Stealing the spotlight
like you always do.

07:12.148 --> 07:14.597
It's my fifth birthday
party all over again.

07:15.069 --> 07:16.054
The what now?

07:16.448 --> 07:17.996
Don't act like you
don't remember.

07:18.117 --> 07:19.022
Or are you trying
to prove

07:19.034 --> 07:20.864
you're a better
actress than me, too?

07:21.233 --> 07:23.810
Sweetie Belle, if I did
anything to upset you then...

07:23.824 --> 07:26.485
Admit you made those
dresses too good on purpose.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.111
I thought they were
supposed to be good.

07:28.171 --> 07:31.295
Yes. Good. Not
jaw-dropping amazing!

07:31.424 --> 07:33.488
I only tried to do what
I thought you wanted.

07:33.715 --> 07:34.286
HA!

07:39.268 --> 07:40.889
Grr. I don't believe it.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.369
After everything I put
up with all week long.

07:43.666 --> 07:46.087
"Sweetie Belle,
get me some red ribbon."

07:46.401 --> 07:48.606
"No that's not red,
that's cherry."

07:48.852 --> 07:50.870
"No that's not red,
that's cinnamon."

07:51.012 --> 07:53.051
For Pete's sake, it's all red!

07:53.178 --> 07:55.291
I should probably
go talk to her, hmm?

07:55.338 --> 07:57.153
At least Sapphire Shores
won't be all like,

07:57.160 --> 07:58.809
"Ooh, who fetched you
that red ribbon?

07:58.813 --> 08:00.920
Because I don't care about
anything else you made;

08:00.934 --> 08:03.508
all I care about is that
AMAZING RED RIBBON."

08:03.610 --> 08:05.311
Perhaps waiting would be best.

08:19.964 --> 08:21.274
Now I can't even sleep.

08:21.744 --> 08:23.047
Happy now, big sis?

08:28.308 --> 08:31.186
I wish there was a way I could
take back all the work I did.

08:44.971 --> 08:45.916
<i>Even better.</i>

09:08.117 --> 09:09.133
Now what?

09:17.040 --> 09:19.463
And the winner of Best
Writer-Director-Actor

09:19.473 --> 09:21.196
in an Awesome Play
Put On by a Pony

09:21.203 --> 09:23.783
and Her Awesome Best
Friends goes to...

09:24.003 --> 09:25.898
<i>Sweetie Belle!</i>

09:42.360 --> 09:43.201
Don't go!

09:53.383 --> 09:54.148
Stop!

09:54.236 --> 09:56.062
Why do you have to
ruin everything?

10:01.051 --> 10:02.044
ENOUGH!

10:10.165 --> 10:11.960
Princess Luna!
It's really you!

10:12.243 --> 10:13.215
Or am I dreaming?

10:13.629 --> 10:14.840
What do you think?

10:15.635 --> 10:16.327
Let me see.

10:16.522 --> 10:19.424
You just rescued me from a
maniacal laughing Rarity Cloud.

10:20.144 --> 10:21.492
Yeah, probably dreaming.

10:21.832 --> 10:24.351
I understand what you're
going through, Sweetie Belle.

10:24.911 --> 10:28.083
I too have a sister who often
shines more brightly than me.

10:28.454 --> 10:30.405
And with this I have struggled.

10:35.145 --> 10:37.102
Wait! Come back! Luna?

10:37.373 --> 10:38.357
Can you hear me?

10:38.640 --> 10:40.177
Thank you for what you did.

10:41.416 --> 10:45.742
Help! Luna! Luna!

10:52.052 --> 10:53.254
I remember this.

10:53.358 --> 10:54.901
This is my fifth
birthday party.

10:56.714 --> 10:59.342
<i>I decided to make</i>
<i>a grand entrance.</i>

10:59.586 --> 11:02.261
<i>I made myself all beautiful,</i>
<i>just like my big sister.</i>

11:04.228 --> 11:07.016
Finally I was perfect, and
then went to the stairs

11:07.020 --> 11:08.780
to enter like the
belle of the ball.

11:09.293 --> 11:11.022
<i>When I finally came</i>
<i>out of my room,</i>

11:11.036 --> 11:12.714
<i>I found the party</i>
<i>going on without me.</i>

11:15.804 --> 11:17.941
And I kept posing at
the top of the stairs,

11:18.023 --> 11:20.415
waiting to be noticed,
but all I heard was...

11:20.760 --> 11:23.102
These party favors
are the coolest.

11:25.207 --> 11:25.908
Awesome.

11:26.062 --> 11:27.180
Where'd you get these?

11:27.557 --> 11:28.556
Made them myself.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.575
And of course you'll
all want cake, won't you?

11:32.321 --> 11:33.927
You're the greatest, Rarity.

11:34.202 --> 11:35.662
Who needs a birthday girl

11:35.672 --> 11:38.985
<i>when you've got the birthday</i>
<i>girl's amazing big sister?</i>

11:44.587 --> 11:46.454
That's when I learned
never try to shine

11:46.460 --> 11:47.806
with my big sister around.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.688
But perhaps you didn't
have the whole story.

11:51.215 --> 11:52.731
I thought you said
you understood.

11:53.471 --> 11:54.130
Luna?

11:57.264 --> 11:58.647
<i>Where's Sweetie Belle?</i>

11:59.787 --> 12:01.806
I'm sure she'll be
along at any moment.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.796
I'm tired of waiting.

12:05.159 --> 12:08.600
I say we get out of here before
we all keel over from boredom!

12:08.958 --> 12:09.906
Who's with me?

12:12.280 --> 12:14.107
Poor Sweetie Belle!

12:14.294 --> 12:16.296
Nopony's gonna come to another
one of her parties

12:16.308 --> 12:18.033
after this fiasco.

12:19.317 --> 12:22.946
Don't go. You'll miss out on
the... party favors.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.690
I was going to save them
till the end but...

12:30.110 --> 12:32.538
These party favors
are the coolest!

12:34.626 --> 12:36.558
Awesome! Where'd you get these?

12:36.839 --> 12:37.795
I made them myself.

12:38.193 --> 12:39.966
And of course, you'll all
want cake, won't you?

12:41.838 --> 12:43.184
Who needs a birthday girl

12:43.192 --> 12:46.372
when you've got the birthday
girl's amazing big sister!

12:49.562 --> 12:50.466
Oh no, no, no!

12:50.741 --> 12:52.778
All of these things were
Sweetie Belle's idea.

12:52.995 --> 12:55.239
I just assisted
with the execution.

12:55.810 --> 12:58.647
I guess Rarity wasn't trying
to steal the spotlight.

12:58.905 --> 13:00.833
She was trying to save my party.

13:02.154 --> 13:02.862
Luna?

13:10.312 --> 13:11.084
Luna!

13:34.099 --> 13:36.120
Should I hem the cloaks
now or wait until I'm there?

13:36.587 --> 13:39.291
I could hem them now but
I might have to redo them.

13:39.570 --> 13:40.415
When was this?

13:40.735 --> 13:42.618
But if I wait until I'm
in Canterlot to hem them,

13:42.874 --> 13:45.153
Sapphire Shores might not get
the best first impression.

13:45.547 --> 13:48.286
Wait. This must've happened
earlier tonight.

13:50.017 --> 13:51.890
Sapphire Shores is
such a big star

13:51.908 --> 13:53.537
and such a stickler
for details.

13:53.902 --> 13:55.443
What if everything's
not perfect enough?

13:56.318 --> 13:58.895
Funny, I thought I was
the only one who got worried

13:58.901 --> 14:00.109
about stuff like that.

14:00.858 --> 14:03.041
Buck up, Rarity;
stop this foolishness.

14:03.170 --> 14:04.975
You've done your best and
left nothing to chance.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.512
All that's needed now
is a good night's rest.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.150
I hope everything goes all
right for her tomorrow.

14:14.380 --> 14:16.774
Hmm. How curious you
should say that.

14:18.801 --> 14:21.305
Go. Go see what
the future holds

14:21.315 --> 14:25.221
if you fail to rein in your
worst instincts as I once did.

14:33.605 --> 14:35.098
And here it is.

14:35.420 --> 14:36.735
The crème de la crème.

14:36.938 --> 14:37.951
Nooo!

14:38.003 --> 14:39.529
The piece de resistance.

14:39.865 --> 14:40.844
Don't!

14:45.691 --> 14:46.983
Ooooh!

14:49.783 --> 14:50.700
The headdress!

14:52.892 --> 14:54.993
Looks like I made
a mistake here.

14:55.086 --> 14:56.801
But this is impossible.

14:56.817 --> 14:58.743
I checked and
rechecked everything.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.212
This couldn't have happened.

15:00.430 --> 15:01.687
You sure about that, honey?

15:02.076 --> 15:04.070
Please. You must believe me.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.943
Listen to my sister!

15:21.650 --> 15:23.350
I don't want to see any more.

15:24.062 --> 15:25.305
Always check and recheck.

15:25.795 --> 15:27.832
Who all wants to
hear a funny story

15:27.841 --> 15:29.968
about my ex-costume
designer?

15:31.693 --> 15:34.394
Check, recheck and
recheck and recheck!

15:34.803 --> 15:35.978
Make it stop!

15:36.212 --> 15:38.384
Princess Luna,
can you hear me?

15:38.831 --> 15:40.450
Make me a dress, Rarity?

15:40.692 --> 15:41.746
Please?

15:41.752 --> 15:44.661
Go away. You know I
don't do that anymore.

15:48.963 --> 15:50.612
Wake me up,
Princess Luna!

15:50.626 --> 15:52.868
Wake me up! Wake me up!

15:59.884 --> 16:00.618
Rarity?

16:01.535 --> 16:02.056
Oh no.

16:02.772 --> 16:04.355
The boxes. Gone.

16:04.854 --> 16:05.838
I'm too late.

16:06.351 --> 16:08.987
She left for Canterlot!

16:15.422 --> 16:18.027
The key is for you two to
distract Rarity long enough

16:18.033 --> 16:20.528
for me to put the stitch back
in without her noticing.

16:20.903 --> 16:22.573
If we're not too late already.

16:22.975 --> 16:23.873
Oh my gosh!

16:23.974 --> 16:26.173
I can't believe we're going
to see Sapphire Shores.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.840
I'm such a huge fan.
I know all her songs.

16:28.979 --> 16:30.080
"Get Your Pony On".

16:30.333 --> 16:32.175
Ooh, that's one of
my favorites.

16:32.405 --> 16:34.800
<i>This isn't a trip to</i>
<i>see Sapphire Shores.</i>

16:35.151 --> 16:37.570
It's a trip to save my sister
from a horrible future.

16:37.877 --> 16:38.768
"Serves Her Right".

16:39.882 --> 16:41.334
How can you say that?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.223
Rarity doesn't
deserve that at all.

16:43.488 --> 16:44.868
No. "Serves Her Right"

16:44.870 --> 16:47.223
is another one of
Sapphire Shores' songs.

16:47.568 --> 16:49.040
You seriously didn't know that?

16:49.223 --> 16:50.969
Don't you listen to her music?

16:51.662 --> 16:53.069
I prefer showtunes.

16:56.942 --> 16:59.244
<i>Five, six</i>
<i>seven eight, ba-bam!</i>

16:59.717 --> 17:01.441
Oh! Bravo!

17:01.814 --> 17:03.777
Fabulous! Magnifique!

17:04.290 --> 17:06.226
One more time.
From the top.

17:06.819 --> 17:08.167
Let's not embarrass me

17:08.171 --> 17:10.210
in front of my favorite
designer this time.

17:11.051 --> 17:13.145
And a one-two-three-four!

17:14.694 --> 17:16.655
But you have to let us in.

17:16.926 --> 17:19.242
I'm Sapphire Shores'
designer's sister.

17:20.965 --> 17:22.657
You have to believe us.

17:22.716 --> 17:26.760
Kid, the only thing I have to
do is make sure Sapphire Shores

17:26.774 --> 17:30.171
doesn't get interrupted
all day by fans like you.

17:30.680 --> 17:31.990
But I'm not a fan!

17:32.140 --> 17:32.897
I am.

17:32.950 --> 17:33.629
Me too.

17:34.085 --> 17:35.322
Not helping.

17:39.629 --> 17:41.717
Now that's how I like it.

17:42.081 --> 17:43.658
You rocked it, girls.

17:43.832 --> 17:45.713
Get some water
and be back in ten.

17:47.051 --> 17:50.409
Rarity, come on up here and
show me what you brought me.

17:50.530 --> 17:53.194
Sapphire wants to see
it and to love it.

17:56.798 --> 17:58.220
Almost.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.899
We've got to get in there. Now!

18:09.354 --> 18:10.721
<i>OK, then.</i>

18:10.891 --> 18:12.706
Liking what I see so far.

18:12.948 --> 18:14.967
So is this the whole shebang?

18:15.326 --> 18:18.187
Actually, I saved
the best for last.

18:29.962 --> 18:32.101
And here it is.

18:34.928 --> 18:36.682
You've gotta see this
with the cinnamon ribbon.

18:36.874 --> 18:37.662
You'll love it.

18:37.882 --> 18:38.883
Sweetie Belle!

18:39.248 --> 18:40.280
You know her?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.720
Uh, heh heh.

18:42.829 --> 18:43.627
Just a moment.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.297
Oh good! This is
just a dream.

19:13.849 --> 19:16.327
Actually, no. This
is very much real.

19:16.938 --> 19:20.852
Oh Luna, I wish none
of this ever happened.

19:21.344 --> 19:22.667
What am I going to do?

19:22.936 --> 19:24.940
Let's begin with this.

19:27.422 --> 19:30.202
And I think I know how
you can even improve it.

19:33.770 --> 19:36.911
I'd like to know what in the
wide wide realm of Equestria

19:36.924 --> 19:40.076
this stunt of yours is all
about, and I want to know now.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.682
Do you have any idea how
important this job is to me?

19:45.077 --> 19:46.456
Actually, I do.

19:47.190 --> 19:49.533
I was upset at you for stealing
<i>the spotlight from me</i>

19:49.547 --> 19:50.224
at the play,

19:50.462 --> 19:52.493
so I pulled out the center
stitch to the headpiece,

19:52.558 --> 19:53.738
so it would fall apart.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.954
What?

19:55.295 --> 19:57.592
But then I realized I didn't
want your future to be ruined

19:57.603 --> 19:59.894
forever and ever so I
came back to change it

19:59.902 --> 20:00.899
before it was too late.

20:01.630 --> 20:04.575
So here it is; it's all fixed.

20:05.147 --> 20:06.208
Please forgive me.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.975
Wait! What is this?

20:11.211 --> 20:14.058
Trust me; Sapphire Shores
is going to love it.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.532
Rarity, this isn't
going to work out.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.620
You don't get to my
level of success

20:22.636 --> 20:24.458
without learning
to read the signs,

20:24.665 --> 20:27.996
and this situation has bad
luck written all over it.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.659
I promise you'll
absolutely adore the headdress

20:30.663 --> 20:31.963
as soon as you see it.

20:41.635 --> 20:45.006
My, it is attractive, but..

20:45.371 --> 20:46.501
Look at the stitching.

20:46.887 --> 20:48.261
<i>Real close.</i>

20:49.761 --> 20:53.352
<i>Well, I'll be.</i>
<i>It's a dolphin.</i>

20:53.925 --> 20:55.510
That's my lucky animal!

20:55.925 --> 20:57.777
They swim with me in my dreams.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.549
Wherever did you come up
with the idea for a dolphin?

21:02.031 --> 21:03.607
Oh, it just came to me...

21:04.830 --> 21:05.756
in a dream.

21:10.107 --> 21:12.394
I'm sorry I got jealous
about those dresses;

21:12.827 --> 21:14.872
I know now that you were
only trying to help.

21:15.155 --> 21:17.477
Oh Sweetie, I
forgive you.

21:18.031 --> 21:19.982
But I never did get
to see your play.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.969
Any chance I could catch
an encore performance?

21:23.615 --> 21:25.652
I don't think the play
was all that good.

21:26.161 --> 21:29.065
To be honest? The costumes
were the best part.

21:29.404 --> 21:31.020
Awwww.
