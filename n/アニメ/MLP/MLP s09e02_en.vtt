WEBVTT

00:03.970 --> 00:07.006
Celestia: It is time
for us to retire.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.475
And you want ME
to take your place?

00:09.577 --> 00:11.910
With the help of
your friends, of course.

00:12.112 --> 00:15.681
You may call
me.. Grogar.

00:15.783 --> 00:19.118
Together, Equestria
will be ours.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.554
Sombra: I will take back the
Crystal Empire on my own!

00:22.656 --> 00:23.989
Spike: How are we
going to stop them?

00:24.091 --> 00:25.624
Twilight: With the
Elements of Harmony!

00:25.726 --> 00:27.893
With those, we can
defeat anypony.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.848
What. Just. Happened!

01:22.950 --> 01:26.452
The Tree of Harmony can't
really be gone, can it?

01:27.054 --> 01:28.253
It can't be...

01:28.355 --> 01:31.757
But it is! You thought
you'd defeated me,

01:32.059 --> 01:33.392
but you led
me right to

01:33.494 --> 01:35.127
the source of
your power!

01:35.429 --> 01:37.362
Now that it's
destroyed,

01:37.464 --> 01:39.698
nothing can stop me!

01:42.669 --> 01:44.336
He's right. With
the Elements gone,

01:44.438 --> 01:46.271
I don't know how
we can defeat him.

01:46.373 --> 01:49.608
Then we'll just have to beat
him the old-fashioned way!

02:10.831 --> 02:11.863
Hey!

02:12.165 --> 02:14.366
Ha! You're no match for me!

02:14.468 --> 02:17.203
I will finally rule
the Crystal Empire.

02:17.805 --> 02:24.343
Wait. With you out of the way,
I will rule all of Equestria!

02:24.745 --> 02:25.444
NO!

02:25.546 --> 02:30.415
Oh, yes. And I think I know
exactly where I'll start!

02:30.517 --> 02:32.151
Don't you dare say it!

02:32.353 --> 02:35.454
Your sweet little home town.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.956
You leave Ponyville alone!

02:38.058 --> 02:39.158
Or what?

02:39.260 --> 02:43.362
Without your Elements, it would
be so easy to control you.

02:48.635 --> 02:49.802
But there's no point,

02:50.304 --> 02:54.306
my conquering Ponyville is
already your greatest fear!

02:54.608 --> 02:55.742
Ha ha ha ha!

02:57.644 --> 02:58.643
NO!

03:01.081 --> 03:02.114
What do we do!?

03:02.216 --> 03:04.850
I don't know. The Tree of
Harmony grew the Elements;

03:05.152 --> 03:07.552
it kept the Everfree
Forest under control.

03:07.654 --> 03:08.887
And now it's gone.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.655
Sombra will take
over Equestria,

03:10.757 --> 03:12.157
and it's all my fault.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.993
I knew I wasn't ready to
take the Princesses' place,

03:15.095 --> 03:17.496
but I never thought
I'd mess up this badly!

03:20.968 --> 03:22.601
What are you
looking at me for?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.603
This is usually when
you say something funny

03:24.705 --> 03:26.105
to lift our spirits.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.441
Sorry, nothing about
this is funny to me.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.712
I'm sorry, I'm
trying to be strong,

03:33.814 --> 03:35.981
but I just can't bear to think
about poor Sweetie Belle

03:36.083 --> 03:38.583
under the spell
of that monster.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.752
Or those sweet
little Cake twins.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.021
Or Spike or Starlight.

03:43.123 --> 03:47.025
Or Angel or anypony forced
to do that monster's bidding!

03:48.595 --> 03:49.328
What the--

03:49.730 --> 03:52.031
Twilight, what are you doing?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.266
We can't just stay here.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.835
I don't have a plan and I don't
know what I'm going to do

03:56.937 --> 03:59.104
once we get out, but
we can't just sit here

03:59.206 --> 04:02.207
and let Sombra make slaves
of every pony we love.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.542
Let me help. I'm faster.

04:06.813 --> 04:07.979
I like digging!

04:10.918 --> 04:12.918
I've been known to
get my hooves dirty.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.019
Move over, y'all!

04:14.221 --> 04:17.155
Normally I wouldn't dream
of digging, but right now...

04:17.557 --> 04:19.290
Show me the muddy!

04:37.444 --> 04:38.410
Apple Bloom!

04:39.480 --> 04:41.680
It's me. Look at
me, sugarcube!

04:43.550 --> 04:46.050
Twilight, you gotta
free her! Please!

04:53.827 --> 04:56.061
I-I-can't. Without
the Elements,

04:56.163 --> 04:58.797
my magic isn't strong
enough to stop Sombra's!

04:59.704 --> 05:00.437
Spike!

05:03.738 --> 05:05.971
Spike, where are you
going? Starlight?

05:06.173 --> 05:09.040
[robotic] We must lay siege to Canterlot.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.909
No! Snap out of it, you two!

05:11.111 --> 05:13.044
You're stronger than his magic.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.113
Rarity: Sweetie
Belle, please stop!

05:15.215 --> 05:17.015
I can't get her to stop.
I can't get her to--

05:17.117 --> 05:19.951
None of us can. We
can't reach them.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.730
He made them bake a black
licorice fruitcake that says

05:31.832 --> 05:33.865
"Congratulations to our
favorite Supreme Emperor,

05:33.967 --> 05:36.201
King Sombra!" in
green frosting!

05:36.803 --> 05:39.671
IT'S THE UGLIEST
CAKE I'VE EVER SEEN!

05:42.075 --> 05:45.444
Twilight, this is
bad. Like really bad.

05:45.546 --> 05:49.348
I've never been so
sad in my whole life.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.550
I don't know what to do. I
don't know how to free them

05:51.652 --> 05:53.152
and I don't know
how to stop Sombra!

05:53.454 --> 05:56.388
Everypony was so sure
I'd do such a great job!

05:56.490 --> 05:58.523
Well, this is exactly
what I was afraid of.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.859
Could anything else
possibly go wrong!?

06:00.961 --> 06:03.995
Well, with the Tree
of Harmony gone,

06:04.097 --> 06:05.864
the Everfree Forest
could grow out of control

06:05.966 --> 06:07.199
and threaten the town!

06:07.701 --> 06:09.968
Darling, that's
oddly specific.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.015
Even if we figure out
how to defeat Sombra

06:24.117 --> 06:25.984
and bring everypony
back to Ponyville,

06:26.186 --> 06:27.319
if we don't stop the forest,

06:27.421 --> 06:29.588
there won't be a
Ponyville to come back to!

06:36.363 --> 06:37.328
Rainbow: Ahem.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.136
For our friends.

06:44.338 --> 06:45.704
For our families.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.272
For our home.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.241
For Equestria!

06:50.744 --> 06:53.144
All: Equestriaaaa!

07:07.994 --> 07:09.795
You! Break it down.

07:26.013 --> 07:30.048
They've fled. Celestia
and Luna are too cowardly

07:30.150 --> 07:36.554
to even stand against
me. Equestria is MINE!

07:55.876 --> 07:57.108
Come on, everypony!

08:07.554 --> 08:08.887
We've been at this for hours,

08:08.989 --> 08:10.956
but it's just growin'
back too fast!

08:11.258 --> 08:13.124
We have to keep trying!

08:24.171 --> 08:25.738
I know we're supposed to
be able to handle things

08:25.840 --> 08:27.873
on our own, but I've
never been happier

08:27.975 --> 08:29.941
to see two ponies
in my whole life!

08:30.043 --> 08:33.245
[zap] Nopony is meant to
handle this on their own.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.380
Starswirl! The Tree
of Harmony, it's--

08:35.482 --> 08:38.917
I know. I alerted the
princesses as soon as I could.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.086
I felt it, when it happened.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.523
Like part of my essence
just ceased to be.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.226
I know what you mean. I'm sorry.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.028
Don't be. I've more
than enough magic in me

08:50.130 --> 08:52.631
to keep the Everfree
Forest under control.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.665
You can do that?

08:53.767 --> 08:56.134
The Pillars and I planted
the Tree of Harmony.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.870
Who do you think kept
the Forest under control

08:58.972 --> 09:00.272
before it did?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.076
It will take time,

09:04.277 --> 09:06.810
but with the Princesses'
help, I can keep it at bay.

09:12.519 --> 09:15.620
Aw, yeah! Go get 'em, Beardy!

09:22.529 --> 09:25.897
Sombra's back and he's taken
control of all of our friends!

09:26.199 --> 09:28.200
We've left Canterlot
defenseless!

09:28.802 --> 09:31.937
Twilight, you must
go! Defend Equestria

09:32.639 --> 09:34.773
and we shall
contain the forest.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.508
At least now we're back
to just one problem.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.989
Aw, everypony's all evil-y.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.191
Sombra's going
to force us

09:53.293 --> 09:55.460
to fight our way
through our friends?

09:55.562 --> 09:56.995
Not if I can help it!

10:11.712 --> 10:14.813
OK. Guess we need a
different plan. Twilight?

10:14.915 --> 10:17.048
I don't know! I'm not
prepared to fight against

10:17.150 --> 10:18.884
the citizens of Equestria.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.987
I guess that's one more
thing I'm not ready to do.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.155
Well, we'd better figure
out something quick

10:24.257 --> 10:26.658
because none of them seem
to have a problem with it.

10:36.871 --> 10:39.304
Oooh! Sorry about this, Fancy Pants!

10:44.645 --> 10:46.978
We promise we'll let y'all
out as soon as we can!

10:51.284 --> 10:52.551
Will I go here?

10:53.453 --> 10:54.886
Or here?

10:55.288 --> 10:56.855
Or here or there!

10:59.159 --> 10:59.824
Huh?

11:12.372 --> 11:13.171
Gotcha!

11:16.543 --> 11:18.276
I don't know how long
we can hold them off.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.478
And holding them off
isn't what we need anyhow.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.080
We need to get inside.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.882
But we can't just
leave them here,

11:23.984 --> 11:25.984
all possessed and Sombrafied.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.719
What do we do, Twilight?

11:27.921 --> 11:30.288
I don't know, but
we can't stay here.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.427
I'm sorry we couldn't
help our friends,

11:35.529 --> 11:37.162
but I didn't know
what else to do.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.697
At least we're inside.

11:39.099 --> 11:43.602
Yeah. All we have to do
now is defeat King Sombra. [nervous chuckle]

11:44.104 --> 11:45.636
I-- we--

11:48.108 --> 11:51.409
Oh, my. No Elements?
No princesses?

11:51.511 --> 11:53.912
Seems like you're in
a bit of a pickle.

11:54.014 --> 11:57.448
Or are you in [snap]
more of a jam?

11:59.586 --> 12:01.720
Discord! What are
you doing here!?

12:02.622 --> 12:04.655
Well, I was going to hang
these up all over the castle

12:04.757 --> 12:06.758
to celebrate your coronation,

12:06.860 --> 12:09.928
but apparently, it's
a bit premature.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.464
I'm so glad to see you!

12:13.566 --> 12:14.999
We could really use
some all-powerful

12:15.101 --> 12:16.735
Lord of Chaos' help right now!

12:17.537 --> 12:20.405
Moi? Oh, I couldn't possibly.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.445
Aw, poodles!

12:30.951 --> 12:32.451
Discord, <i>please</i>?

12:33.153 --> 12:35.187
Ugh. Fine.

12:35.489 --> 12:38.489
Just to be clear, I was really
rooting for you to do this

12:38.591 --> 12:41.493
on your own and parlay
that confidence boost

12:41.595 --> 12:45.564
into being the best Protectors
of Equestria you can be.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.466
A little less talking and
a little more helping!

12:55.843 --> 12:57.642
Oh! Thank you, Discord!

12:57.944 --> 12:59.844
I don't know what
we'd do without you.

13:09.022 --> 13:13.258
OK, "King" Sombra. Time
to give up the crown.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.762
Here to fight the good fight
with nothing but your wits?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.764
Admirable, but foolish.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.132
Ha!

13:24.905 --> 13:28.273
Well, I guess it's on
me to be the MVP today.

13:28.375 --> 13:32.677
I was betting on you, and
I do hate being wrong.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.245
Although if you think about it,

13:34.347 --> 13:39.718
I am your friend so maybe you
win because friendship wins?

13:39.820 --> 13:42.487
Although Fluttershy should
get most of the credit for that.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.622
She's my favorite.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.965
[gasp] Discord!

14:01.308 --> 14:04.509
Not even the Lord of Chaos
can stand against me!

14:04.711 --> 14:08.813
I am truly the most powerful
creature in Equestria!

14:11.318 --> 14:12.451
Discord!

14:12.853 --> 14:13.919
We need you!

14:14.021 --> 14:16.254
Oh! Please wake up. Please wake up.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.759
[gasp] Discord!

14:21.061 --> 14:24.463
I'm so glad you're OK. We
can't beat him without you.

14:24.765 --> 14:27.232
You couldn't beat
me with him either!

14:31.404 --> 14:33.704
It would appear that
you're on your own.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.911
I have nothing left to give..

14:39.613 --> 14:41.913
That's it then. We're doomed?

14:42.315 --> 14:43.715
Of course you are!

14:43.817 --> 14:46.718
I can't believe it's taken
you this long to realize it!

14:46.920 --> 14:50.889
Now, how shall I
eliminate all this clutter

14:50.991 --> 14:52.524
in my throne room?

14:54.895 --> 14:57.696
Listen to me. You don't need me.

14:57.798 --> 14:59.631
You don't need the princesses

14:59.733 --> 15:02.134
and you certainly don't
need the Elements.

15:02.836 --> 15:06.037
Fluttershy, you will
always be kind.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.940
Applejack, you will
always be honest.

15:09.042 --> 15:12.478
Rarity, you'll
always be generous.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.982
And Rainbow Dash will
be loyal as can be.

15:17.384 --> 15:21.653
Pinkie will always bring
laughter wherever she goes

15:21.755 --> 15:27.292
and Twilight, [wheeze] you are
and always will be

15:27.494 --> 15:29.561
the embodiment of Magic.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.598
You lost sight of
what's in front of you.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.801
You're here, together,
willing to give

15:36.903 --> 15:39.738
everything you've
got for Equestria.

15:39.840 --> 15:44.676
Nothing and no pony can ever
take that away from you

15:45.078 --> 15:48.213
because that's who you are.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.650
It's going to take more
than a sentimental speech

15:52.752 --> 15:54.052
to save you.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.355
Discord's right. We've
proven time and time again

15:57.457 --> 16:00.559
that the real magic is the
six of us working together.

16:00.961 --> 16:04.095
With these girls by my
side, I'm not afraid of you.

16:04.197 --> 16:07.332
I'm not afraid of what you can
do or how much power you have!

16:07.534 --> 16:08.599
You should be.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.672
You may knock us down, but we're
going to get back up again.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.376
And again.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.447
And again. As long
as we're together,

16:22.549 --> 16:24.715
we will never stop
trying to defeat you!

16:30.824 --> 16:32.191
For our friends.

16:32.793 --> 16:34.259
For our families.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.294
For our Home.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.996
For Equestria!

16:41.535 --> 16:47.238
No! This can't be possible!
Your magic can't defeat mine!

16:47.540 --> 16:51.442
I destroyed the
source of your power!

16:51.644 --> 16:54.212
You can't destroy our
friendship, Sombra.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.215
And we keep telling bad guys.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.385
But y'all just don't
seem to remember.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.387
Friendship IS magic!

17:09.261 --> 17:12.897
Noooooooo!

17:30.551 --> 17:32.951
Ooh! Do you want more juice?

17:33.453 --> 17:37.188
Only if it's not too much
trouble, and it's red,

17:37.390 --> 17:40.892
and it has one of those little
umbrellas, and two cherries.

17:40.994 --> 17:45.831
No no. Actually make it three.
And maybe..... some doughnuts?

17:46.233 --> 17:49.300
I see you've made
yourselves at home.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.437
Celestia! Luna! I know
what you're going to say.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.605
I should have called on
you as soon as I knew

17:54.707 --> 17:56.074
how dangerous it was.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.644
A good leader knows when to
ask for help and I didn't.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.981
And because of me, the Tree
of Harmony was destroyed.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.650
Equestria deserves somepony
much better than me

18:05.752 --> 18:06.618
as its leader.

18:07.020 --> 18:07.953
You're right.

18:09.055 --> 18:09.821
Oh!

18:10.023 --> 18:14.325
About one thing. A good leader
knows when to ask for help.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.362
But a great leader has
the courage to admit

18:17.464 --> 18:18.797
when they've
made a mistake

18:18.999 --> 18:21.166
and the strength
to make it right.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.335
Today, you've proven to
me beyond any doubt,

18:24.437 --> 18:26.337
that you will be a
great leader.

18:26.939 --> 18:27.739
Will be?

18:28.041 --> 18:30.675
Luna and I have decided
it may have been

18:30.777 --> 18:33.111
a bit unfair to thrust
this upon you

18:33.413 --> 18:35.780
without giving you the
time you need to prepare.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.251
Oh, thank goodness! I
really wasn't ready.

18:40.053 --> 18:43.488
Not ready!? So Twilight's
not taking over?

18:43.690 --> 18:45.056
This was all for nothing?

18:45.158 --> 18:47.291
I pretended to be
very hurt and gave

18:47.393 --> 18:49.427
one of the most convincing
speeches of-

18:49.529 --> 18:51.029
PRETENDED?

18:51.631 --> 18:54.499
Of course. You don't
think some would-be-king

18:54.601 --> 18:57.135
could actually hurt the
Lord of Chaos, do you?

18:57.237 --> 19:00.271
Anyway, as I was saying, I
pretended to be very hurt

19:00.373 --> 19:02.740
to convince you that
you didn't need anything

19:02.842 --> 19:04.976
but yourself to be
the incredible leader

19:05.078 --> 19:08.680
I know you can be! And
now it's not happening!?

19:08.882 --> 19:11.350
It will, but when she's ready.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.485
How can she not be ready!?

19:14.587 --> 19:17.989
What a waste of a perfectly
wonderful speech!

19:18.091 --> 19:20.725
Oh! Honestly, I don't know
why I even bother!

19:21.427 --> 19:25.129
Ah! So he could have ended
the whole Sombra thing

19:25.331 --> 19:26.631
whenever he wanted!

19:26.833 --> 19:29.367
But he didn't because he cares.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.770
That's Discord for you.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.139
He sure has a weird way
of being supportive.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.708
Super odd dude.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.777
I heard that.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.784
Also, truth be told, Celestia
and I had fun today,

19:46.886 --> 19:49.654
fighting side-by-side with
Starswirl for our home!

19:49.856 --> 19:52.623
It's been years since we've
gotten to do what you girls do.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.126
You all make it look so easy.

19:55.428 --> 19:58.363
Well, we are kind of
an awesome team.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.798
Every adventure
is heart-pounding

20:01.000 --> 20:02.267
but so rewarding!

20:02.769 --> 20:05.804
I'm up for anything, as long
as it's with all of you!

20:06.606 --> 20:09.074
Life certainly hasn't
been dull since we met.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.276
Nowhere else I'd rather be.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.278
We are pretty
incredible together.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.646
And we would do
anything for Equestria.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.349
I guess I know,
when the time comes,

20:18.551 --> 20:21.051
as long as we're
together, we probably--

20:21.153 --> 20:22.520
Ahem!

20:22.822 --> 20:24.789
--we definitely got this.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.432
Now, I'll say something
nice about centaurs.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.635
Tirek, you say something
nice about changelings.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.304
And Chrysalis, you say
something nice about ponies.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.272
NEVER!

20:44.010 --> 20:48.246
Let us hope the three of you
will be enough for my plans.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.482
And what of King Sombra?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.318
Did he succeed?

20:53.720 --> 20:54.519
HA!

21:01.794 --> 21:05.363
I'd say he gambled and lost.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.465
But at least he can
serve as a warning

21:07.567 --> 21:10.568
to those who doubt
continuing with my plans.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.972
Unless any of you have doubts...

21:14.474 --> 21:15.906
Uh. Not I.

21:16.108 --> 21:16.607
No!

21:16.709 --> 21:17.442
I'm good.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.678
Then we shall join
forces and work together

21:20.780 --> 21:23.481
to bring Equestria
to its knees!
