00:07.322 --> 00:08.572
Look at that, Tank!

00:09.894 --> 00:11.364
Cloudsdale's here!

00:11.688 --> 00:14.193
That means Ponyville
is next up for winter!

00:23.545 --> 00:26.471
You're doing awesome,
everypony! Keep it up!

00:26.623 --> 00:29.023
We need those leaves
off those trees!

00:31.557 --> 00:35.604
Once we get autumn cleared
away, it'll be "Hello, Winter!"

00:39.566 --> 00:42.290
Was that a yawn
I just saw?

00:44.261 --> 00:47.136
How can you be tired when the
most exciting time of the year

00:47.153 --> 00:48.618
is right around the corner!

00:48.947 --> 00:51.237
And don't forget
the best part...

00:51.494 --> 00:53.726
our first winter together!

00:57.553 --> 00:59.507
Come on, wake up!

00:59.646 --> 01:01.734
Once those ponies bring in
the big fat clouds

01:01.751 --> 01:04.277
full of snowflakes, we'll
have a ton of snow

01:04.290 --> 01:06.244
for our extreme sledding!

01:09.355 --> 01:10.176
Ha ha ha!

01:10.250 --> 01:11.738
Whoa!

01:11.764 --> 01:12.846
Whoo hoo!

01:15.414 --> 01:17.351
And over there we can
play horse hockey!

01:17.738 --> 01:19.242
With no shoulder or rump pads!

01:28.938 --> 01:30.947
Everything's looking
great, don't you think?

01:31.162 --> 01:34.640
Almost everything. Does
Tank look all right to you?

01:37.073 --> 01:39.848
Well, he does seem to be
moving a little slowly.

01:40.176 --> 01:41.343
I know, right?

01:42.185 --> 01:44.000
And he looks kind
of sleepy...

01:44.955 --> 01:45.941
Totally!

01:46.126 --> 01:47.633
just like he always does.

01:47.962 --> 01:50.614
Yeah, heh-heh, I'm
sure you're right.

02:02.556 --> 02:07.550

http://main.yayponies.eu

02:40.496 --> 02:41.477
Well?

02:41.865 --> 02:45.827
I suppose his heartbeat
COULD be a teensy, weensy,

02:45.983 --> 02:48.362
eensy bit slower than usual.

02:48.530 --> 02:51.149
OK, so give him a
vitamin or something.

02:55.637 --> 02:57.141
I don't think he
needs that.

02:57.448 --> 02:58.976
Maybe we're just
staying up too late.

02:59.393 --> 03:00.993
Too many Derring-Do stories.

03:02.206 --> 03:03.591
That's not it either.

03:03.957 --> 03:06.307
Well, what's wrong
with him then?

03:06.576 --> 03:09.052
Nothing. He's
perfectly fine!

03:11.271 --> 03:12.778
He's just going
to hibernate.

03:13.869 --> 03:16.248
You do realize he's
not a bear, right?

03:17.612 --> 03:20.311
When the weather grows cold
and less food is available,

03:20.395 --> 03:23.233
many animals hibernate
to conserve energy.

03:25.924 --> 03:28.821
It's like taking a really
long nap during winter.

03:29.684 --> 03:31.343
And then they wake
up in spring!

03:31.915 --> 03:34.189
And see? Even
tortoises do it.

03:34.404 --> 03:38.349
When the time comes, Tank will
leave and dig into the ground.

03:40.993 --> 03:44.395
But don't worry, he'll
reappear when the spring sun

03:44.416 --> 03:46.336
warms the ground back up.

03:46.538 --> 03:49.296
Come on! Tortoises
don't hibernate.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.709
Somepony put that picture
in there as a joke.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.953
It's not a joke.

03:54.122 --> 03:55.915
Well then your
book must be wrong.

03:57.642 --> 04:01.035
Rainbow Dash, Tank
needs to hibernate.

04:01.355 --> 04:04.690
It's healthy for him, just like
sleeping is healthy for us.

04:05.557 --> 04:08.766
Whatever, OK, thanks.
Come on, Tank.

04:12.825 --> 04:14.054
Where are you going?

04:14.265 --> 04:18.484
To get a second opinion from
a REAL reptile expert.

04:20.627 --> 04:23.612
I told you, Rainbow
Dash. I'm a DRAGON!

04:24.513 --> 04:27.296
Come on, you're
practically twins!

04:29.469 --> 04:30.589
I'm purple!

04:31.250 --> 04:34.004
But if you don't have to
hibernate, why should Tank?

04:34.328 --> 04:37.288
Because he's a TORTOISE.
And I'm a DRAGON.

04:37.949 --> 04:39.229
Same family though, right?

04:39.389 --> 04:40.480
No!

04:40.732 --> 04:42.122
I'll take that as a yes.

04:43.094 --> 04:45.823
Look, if Fluttershy says
tortoises hibernate,

04:45.856 --> 04:47.646
then I guarantee
tortoises hiber--

04:47.667 --> 04:50.016
Well, what would you know?
You're a dragon!

04:53.574 --> 04:55.654
Nopony knows you like
I do, Tank.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.682
All you need is some hard work
to get the ol' blood pumping.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.206
Come on!

05:12.858 --> 05:15.743
These things are heavy!
Chock full o' snowflakes.

05:16.004 --> 05:18.463
We're gonna have such a
killer time in the snow, Tank!

05:20.033 --> 05:24.522
Tank? TANK?

05:25.052 --> 05:28.261
Aw, look at that
cute wittle Tanky!

05:28.336 --> 05:32.324
All snuggly wuggly,
getting ready to hibern---

05:32.526 --> 05:34.332
DON'T SAY THAT WORD!

05:34.631 --> 05:37.709
Which one? Snuggly?
Wuggly? Tanky? Hiberna--

05:37.730 --> 05:38.370
THAT ONE!

05:39.570 --> 05:40.858
I was just saying
how cute he loo--

05:40.880 --> 05:44.829
If you think hiber-- you know,
that napping thing--

05:44.985 --> 05:47.886
is SOOO cute, why
don't you go do it?

05:48.218 --> 05:49.835
Somewhere far away from here!

05:54.774 --> 05:56.160
What are you looking at?

05:56.303 --> 05:59.237
Pinkie Pie and I are just
having a conversation!

06:00.341 --> 06:02.635
Look Rainbow Dash, we all
know how upset you are

06:02.652 --> 06:03.343
about Tank hiber--

06:03.368 --> 06:05.760
SHHHH! Don't say that word!

06:05.882 --> 06:07.145
That's what started this all!

06:07.498 --> 06:09.498
We know how upset
you are about Tank,

06:09.928 --> 06:12.071
but you shouldn't take your
anger out on your friends.

06:12.218 --> 06:14.008
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ANGER?

06:14.080 --> 06:15.768
I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT ANGER!

06:15.920 --> 06:16.896
I'M NOT UPSET!

06:17.048 --> 06:18.665
AND I AM NOT ANGRY!

06:18.943 --> 06:20.067
DO I LOOK ANGRY?

06:22.711 --> 06:25.073
C'MON TANK, LET'S
GET OUTTA HERE!

06:29.793 --> 06:31.591
I need you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed,

06:31.882 --> 06:33.987
not sleepy-eyed
and scaly-tailed...

06:34.597 --> 06:36.644
...which is
exactly what you are.

06:37.052 --> 06:38.416
But get up anyway!

06:43.309 --> 06:45.898
You CAN'T hiber--you know!

06:46.277 --> 06:47.818
What about all the primo things

06:47.835 --> 06:49.397
we're gonna do
together this winter?

06:49.667 --> 06:52.496
Building snowponies,
starting snowball fights,

06:52.623 --> 06:55.010
sipping hot cider by the fire.

06:58.143 --> 07:00.210
DON'T YOU WANT TO DO
THOSE THINGS WITH ME?

07:05.200 --> 07:06.888
Think, Rainbow Dash, think!

07:07.242 --> 07:09.995
Tank's only hibernating
because it's cold, right?

07:11.440 --> 07:14.749
Well, I'd rather have
him awake in the heat

07:15.010 --> 07:16.850
than asleep in the cold.

07:20.004 --> 07:23.002
I'll just have to STOP WINTER!

07:30.265 --> 07:31.907
So, where do
these clouds go?

07:32.143 --> 07:33.532
Over by Clear Skies.

07:33.692 --> 07:35.132
But there's Clear
Skies everywhere.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.035
Yo! Clear Skies
right here!

07:37.200 --> 07:39.094
But there's Clear
Skies over there, too.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.724
That's Open Skies.

07:40.909 --> 07:43.292
There's open
skies everywhere!

07:43.397 --> 07:45.448
I'm not everywhere;
I'm right here.

07:46.261 --> 07:48.926
Wait, so, you're Open Skies,
and you're Clear Skies...

07:49.031 --> 07:50.096
then what's all that?

07:50.248 --> 07:51.949
Open, Clear Skies!

07:52.808 --> 07:55.271
Hey! Where'd our
fluffy clouds go?

07:55.456 --> 07:57.364
Fluffy Clouds?
He's over there!

07:59.423 --> 08:02.833

gonna be a breeze!

Here comes the next shipment!
Move those clouds over!

11:05.221 --> 11:08.934
For every hoofstep back, they
go three hoofsteps forward!

11:09.305 --> 11:10.661
What am I gonna do?

11:24.602 --> 11:26.880
Cloudsdale...THAT'S IT, TANK!

11:27.178 --> 11:28.930
If I can't stop
winter in Ponyville,

11:29.292 --> 11:31.317
maybe I can stop
it at the source!

11:59.764 --> 12:01.587
Lunch hour! Perfect!

12:40.909 --> 12:43.187
The winter lab!
We're in, Tank!

12:43.705 --> 12:45.970
Now, we just gotta figure
out a way to shut it down!

12:47.221 --> 12:49.044
Sabotage snowflakes?

12:49.254 --> 12:51.414
I think we gotta go
bigger than that.

12:53.818 --> 12:54.429
Wait here.

13:06.210 --> 13:09.006
Hmm. We could get
rid of these clouds,

13:09.115 --> 13:11.120
but that's still
not big enough.

13:15.368 --> 13:20.416
Slam dunk! With no water, they
can't make clouds or snow!

13:20.825 --> 13:22.690
They can't make WINTER!

13:26.084 --> 13:28.475
I hate to do this to
those weather ponies,

13:28.534 --> 13:31.221
but desperate times call
for desperate measures!

13:32.614 --> 13:35.886
Oopsie! Looks like these
were a little loose!

13:39.157 --> 13:42.433
And there goes
winter...down the drain!

14:00.581 --> 14:02.012
Whoa! I can't see!

14:09.271 --> 14:09.709
Oof!

14:30.421 --> 14:31.797
Let's get outta here!

14:54.404 --> 14:56.871
What in the name of
Celestia's goin' on up there?

14:57.869 --> 14:59.671
Prepare yourselves, everypony...

15:00.168 --> 15:01.978
Winter is coming.

15:15.730 --> 15:17.296
EVERYPONY! LOOK OUT!

15:44.593 --> 15:46.492
You OK, Tank?

15:50.387 --> 15:52.505
Rainbow Dash! Are
you all right?

15:54.067 --> 15:54.774
No.

16:10.437 --> 16:11.835
Knock, knock!

16:12.593 --> 16:14.661
How are you feeling,
Rainbow Dash?

16:15.498 --> 16:16.846
Whatever.

16:17.587 --> 16:19.616
The poor thing
looks so sad!

16:19.987 --> 16:21.642
Just what are we
going to do?

16:21.941 --> 16:23.397
I don't know
what we CAN do.

16:24.235 --> 16:27.574
Buck up, sugarcube, you just
ain't yourself these days.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.637
Whatever.

16:30.753 --> 16:33.018
Oh, how can I say
this tactfully?

16:33.237 --> 16:34.875
You've lost your
sparkle, Rainbow Dash!

16:35.221 --> 16:41.301
I hate to say this...but well...
you've become...a party pooper!

16:42.138 --> 16:45.781
Didn't you hear me?
I said whatever.

16:46.218 --> 16:49.157
I don't know if you're here
to cheer me up or what,

16:49.452 --> 16:51.002
but I'm fine.

16:51.785 --> 16:52.976
Let me handle this.

16:53.578 --> 16:58.126
Rainbow Dash, your winter
is going to be PETLESS!

17:13.065 --> 17:14.821
Whatever did you
do that for?

17:14.976 --> 17:18.547
Because she'll never get past
this until she lets it all out.

17:29.115 --> 17:34.282
Uh, it's OK! Tank'll come
back in a few months!

17:34.774 --> 17:43.507
MONTHS? [wailing]
I DON'T WANT HIM TO GO!

17:43.604 --> 17:46.800
All right, all right.
There there.

17:47.444 --> 17:50.778
Nice goin', Fluttershy.
How do we get her to stop?

17:51.070 --> 17:54.564
She's got to be about done now.
Can't be too much left in there.

18:01.696 --> 18:03.174
Feeling better?

18:04.732 --> 18:05.600
Uh-huh.

18:12.168 --> 18:14.631
Oh, you poor,
poor thing!

18:17.713 --> 18:20.644
I can't bear to see
Fluttershy cry!

18:20.892 --> 18:23.498
It's...just...heart-wrenching!

18:30.176 --> 18:31.409
You, too?

18:31.591 --> 18:32.804
Nope. I'm good.

18:33.604 --> 18:37.128
Look, everypony, I know how
hard it is to say goodbye--

18:37.402 --> 18:40.880
I'm mostly sad because
you're NOT sad!

18:41.393 --> 18:44.496
What? Me? What
about Applejack?

18:44.766 --> 18:47.671
Applejack cries on
the inside, Twilight!

18:48.227 --> 18:48.896
It's true.

18:49.751 --> 18:52.454
It's all right, Fluttershy.
It's all right.

18:54.231 --> 18:56.762
You think she's done or
just gettin' a third wind?

18:56.989 --> 19:01.221
I don't know. Rainbow
Dash? Are you OK?

19:05.284 --> 19:06.644
I think so.

19:07.465 --> 19:10.189
I feel better.
Really, I do.

19:10.858 --> 19:14.134
Thanks, everypony. I don't
know what I'd do without you.

19:15.789 --> 19:17.473
Or him...

19:21.090 --> 19:24.425
Oh, Tank. I'm sure
gonna miss you.

19:44.454 --> 19:46.560
Well, guess we're starting
winter with a bang.

19:46.821 --> 19:49.578
The fun's come early! Yee-haw!

19:50.922 --> 19:52.909
You think we could mess
up winter every year?

19:52.972 --> 19:54.829
It's way less work!

19:55.225 --> 19:57.995
Uh, I don't think Rainbow
Dash could handle it.

19:58.509 --> 20:00.661
Riding that entire
season from Cloudsdale

20:00.686 --> 20:03.242
to Ponyville WAS
pretty awesome.

20:05.713 --> 20:09.178
I thought you guys might
like to say goodbye to Tank.

20:09.364 --> 20:10.934
He's ready to hibernate.

20:11.717 --> 20:15.275
You're using the word!
She's using the word!

20:15.713 --> 20:17.486
And when Tank
finishes hibernating,

20:17.503 --> 20:20.509
I'm going to throw him the
biggest Welcome Home party ever!

20:20.816 --> 20:23.423
Or wait. Should it be a
"Welcome Above Ground" party?

20:23.600 --> 20:25.208
Or a "Happy Wake-Up" party?

20:25.511 --> 20:27.772
Maybe an "It's
about time" party?

20:28.075 --> 20:30.252
And I'll design him a
very special suit

20:30.311 --> 20:31.322
just for the occasion,

20:31.587 --> 20:32.960
whichever one it
ends up being!

20:33.290 --> 20:35.621
I'm glad you're feelin' a
little better, Rainbow Dash.

20:35.785 --> 20:37.625
Yeah. Me too.

20:48.446 --> 20:51.642
So, you really want to do
this hibernating thing, huh?

20:54.176 --> 20:54.976
Goodbye Tank!

20:54.997 --> 20:56.715
Have a good
sleep, Tank!
See you later,
little fella!

20:56.863 --> 20:58.972
Goodbye Tank,
we'll miss you!

21:10.458 --> 21:12.909
Well? Ready for
some winter fun?

21:13.430 --> 21:16.618
Uh, I'm gonna hang here
and read to him a bit.

21:17.002 --> 21:20.282
That little guy can never get to
sleep without a bedtime story.

21:21.532 --> 21:23.221
I'll be right there.
