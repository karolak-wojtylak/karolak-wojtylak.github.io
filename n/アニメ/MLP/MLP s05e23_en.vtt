00:02.300 --> 00:05.360
Does every animal have their
copy of "Wuthering Hooves"?

00:09.480 --> 00:13.070
Hooray! I love Furry
Friends Book Club.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.700
Now let's discuss
the theme of nature

00:15.700 --> 00:17.380
as it applies to
Hoofcliff's love--

00:19.540 --> 00:21.740
Did somepony leave a light on?

00:24.440 --> 00:25.520
Oh, It's me.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.640
OH! It's me!

00:33.680 --> 00:35.480
We'll continue this
discussion when I get back!

00:48.520 --> 01:00.660

We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

01:26.180 --> 01:26.960
You're here!

01:28.100 --> 01:29.040
Isn't this exciting!

01:30.620 --> 01:33.880
Oh, you were called
too! Thank goodness.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.340
I feel so much better
going with a friend.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.800
I was about to come and get
you but then I got distracted.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.020
Oh.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.940
Ever since the
map called us,

01:42.940 --> 01:44.480
I've been doing a
ton of research.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.100
Testing out potential
friendship problems,

01:47.980 --> 01:50.360
diversifying my
solution portfolio...

01:51.920 --> 01:54.270
"Ever since the map called us"?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.580
But that happened
five minutes ago.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.880
I know, but I want to be one
hundred percent prepared.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.880
I mean, I'm the
Princess of Friendship.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.080
How would it look if I couldn't
solve a friendship problem?

02:04.920 --> 02:07.300
Oh, I'm so lucky I'm
being sent with you.

02:07.780 --> 02:09.860
Speaking of which,
where are we going?

02:10.100 --> 02:11.860
The Smokey Mountains!

02:13.130 --> 02:15.120
Oh, I've never
been there before.

02:15.580 --> 02:18.560
Neither have I. And there isn't
a lot of information on them.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.130
All I could find was this.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.080
"The Smokey Mountains harbor
the most beautiful valley

02:24.080 --> 02:27.660
in all of Equestria between its
two majestic mountain peaks."

02:28.140 --> 02:29.700
That's gorgeous.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.450
And where there's nature,
there's a ton of animal friends!

02:33.800 --> 02:35.320
I can't wait to
get started.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.540
I'm a little nervous, since
that's all I could find.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.720
I usually like to be
a bit more prepared.

02:40.580 --> 02:43.020
You seem pretty
prepared to me.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.460
Are those...for us?

02:47.780 --> 02:51.930
Yup! I've prepared our things:
Snacks, books, blankets, books.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.370
You said books twice.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.480
There are a lot of books.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.310
Oof!

03:00.160 --> 03:01.720
What do you think our friendship
problem's going to be?

03:02.180 --> 03:06.720
I don't know.
But I'm sure we'll figure it out.

03:11.260 --> 03:13.100
Do you think it'll be
a problem about lying?

03:13.980 --> 03:15.920
I'm sure we'll find
out when we get there.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.140
You're right.

03:21.060 --> 03:23.860
Ooh! Could it be about when two
friends just randomly decide

03:23.860 --> 03:25.760
to do something together
but they forget to invite

03:25.760 --> 03:28.000
the third friend and the
third friend feels left out?

03:31.140 --> 03:33.300
Or where one friend tells
another friend's secret

03:33.300 --> 03:34.680
after they ask them not to?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.650
We'll know very, very soon,
since we're almost there.

03:46.900 --> 03:47.860
Here, let me get that.

03:48.660 --> 03:49.990
Oh, thank you.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.260
Sorry I've been a little
scidilly-bopty-boo.

03:52.520 --> 03:55.040
I just can't believe this
is finally happening!

03:59.580 --> 04:00.480
Whoa!

04:01.040 --> 04:02.720
What in
Equestria is happening?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.040
It's nothing like your
book said it would be.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.360
Oh, boy, I'm feeling
very unprepared.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.020
Where do we even start?

04:11.260 --> 04:14.360
Maybe by figuring out where the
flying pumpkins are coming from?

04:16.780 --> 04:17.620
Ready?

04:19.980 --> 04:20.780
Aim.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.480
Fire!

04:26.900 --> 04:31.760
Um, hi, hello. Excuse us,
but... what are you doing?

04:32.320 --> 04:33.840
We're pumpkining our neighbors!

04:34.980 --> 04:39.740
Yes. But, umm, why are you
pumpkining your neighbors?

04:40.080 --> 04:44.360
Well, because the McColts
are just plain rotten.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.200
Hey, wait a tick.
Who are you two?

04:48.480 --> 04:51.060
You're not spies for
the McColts are ya?

04:51.760 --> 04:54.900
I am Twilight Sparkle, the
Princess of Friendship.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.280
And I am here to solve
your friendship problem.

04:57.820 --> 05:00.920
I'm Fluttershy. And
um, I'm here, too.

05:01.800 --> 05:02.740
Ma Hooffield.

05:03.060 --> 05:05.630
Pleased to meet you, but
you're wasting your time.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.200
We don't have a
friendship problem;

05:08.660 --> 05:12.360
we have a McColt problem.

05:12.620 --> 05:14.780
And there's absolutely
no friendship there.

05:18.260 --> 05:21.640
Well, maybe there could be if we
figure out what the McColts did

05:21.640 --> 05:22.720
to make you so mad.

05:23.060 --> 05:25.220
Oh, well they've
done so many things!

05:25.600 --> 05:28.940
Why just today, they shot
pebbles at our farmhouse

05:28.940 --> 05:29.900
and wrecked it!

05:31.700 --> 05:33.520
See, we're not very
good at building

05:33.520 --> 05:36.600
so all it took was a
little pebble. But still.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.500
Oh, no!

05:48.340 --> 05:50.920
I know what to do. We're
gonna talk with these McColts

05:50.920 --> 05:52.380
and hear their
side of the story.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.760
Once we have all the facts,

05:53.940 --> 05:56.500
we can put an end to this,
using reason and rationale.

05:57.180 --> 05:58.340
Good plan!

05:59.420 --> 06:01.220
That's why she's the Princess.

06:02.340 --> 06:05.380
In the meantime, could you
please call off the pumpkining?

06:06.180 --> 06:07.900
Oh, all right.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.500
Thanks. Come on, Fluttershy.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.020
State your business.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.440
Don't even bother.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.100
They're probably spies
for the Hooffields.

06:22.060 --> 06:25.480
Hey wait, you're an Alicorn.

06:25.620 --> 06:28.140
I thought just the three
princesses were Alicorns.

06:28.380 --> 06:31.690
There are four Alicorn
princesses in Equestria now.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.460
I am Twilight Sparkle, The
Princess of Friendship!

06:36.000 --> 06:37.600
And I'm Fluttershy.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.180
We have a new princess?
When did that happen?

06:41.860 --> 06:45.630
And, and how did the Hooffields
come by a princess spy?

06:45.900 --> 06:49.500
We are not spies! Why does
everypony assume we're spies?

06:54.300 --> 06:59.850
Because we don't get a lot of
visitors. I'm Big Daddy McColt.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.040
You caught us at a weird time.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.780
We're in the middle
of a giant feud

07:04.780 --> 07:07.420
with our terrible neighbors!

07:10.720 --> 07:12.690
Well, actually,
that's why we're here.

07:12.980 --> 07:15.240
To solve your problem
with the Hooffields.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.800
So you're here to help
us get rid of them?

07:21.520 --> 07:23.540
No, that's not what
I meant at all!

07:24.600 --> 07:29.810
Well, if you ain't for
us, you're against us.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.940
<i> We are not</i>
<i> on anypony's side.</i>

07:36.280 --> 07:38.180
We're here to help you
become friends again.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.400
Well, that's gonna be hard.

07:41.820 --> 07:45.300
I don't believe we've ever been
friends with the Hooffields.

07:46.000 --> 07:46.880
But you could be.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.380
They're just really upset
you ruined their farmhouse--

07:49.640 --> 07:52.780
Wait a hog-wogglin'
minute! We only did that

07:52.780 --> 07:56.640
because the Hooffields pulled
the pin out of our wagon wheel.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.840
A whole week's worth of food
rollin' down the mountain!

08:02.200 --> 08:04.720
Us McColts are
mighty fine builders

08:04.720 --> 08:07.500
but we don't know the
first thing about farming.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.580
We have to travel a ways
away to buy our food.

08:11.820 --> 08:14.580
And now, we'll be stuck
eating the pumpkins

08:14.580 --> 08:16.740
the Hooffields launched at us!

08:17.060 --> 08:21.240
Pumpkin bread, pumpkin
soup, pumpkin quesadillas,

08:21.420 --> 08:27.720
pumpkin paella, pumpkin cheese,
pumpkin pie, pumpkin fri-ta-tas.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.380
Actually that all sounds
pretty good, but it'll get old.

08:47.020 --> 08:49.060
Have you tried meeting
at a neutral location,

08:49.320 --> 08:52.580
talking about your problems, and
really listening to each other?

08:53.280 --> 08:57.220
What? No. They'd sooner
launch their dinners at us

08:57.220 --> 08:58.200
than listen to us.

08:58.960 --> 09:02.660
Well, they'll listen to me.
I'm an impartial third party.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.320
Attention,
Hooffields and McColts!

09:10.600 --> 09:15.040
I'm not on anypony's side, but I
can see you're both wasting time

09:15.040 --> 09:17.320
and resources on being
mean to each other.

09:17.580 --> 09:20.200
Ponies are supposed to help
each other and be kind.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.700
So, let's stop this
senseless fighting.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.140
There. That should do it.
Ready to go home, Fluttershy?

09:29.620 --> 09:33.040
I'd love to, but if we've
solved the problem already,

09:33.280 --> 09:35.460
shouldn't our cutie
marks be glowing again?

09:36.080 --> 09:40.560
Oh, yeah. They should be
glowing any minute now.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.540
Or not.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.880
So much for potential friendship
solution number twenty-eight.

09:59.260 --> 10:01.800
I guess we should find
out why the Hooffields

10:01.800 --> 10:03.160
are launching tomatoes now.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.870
One at a time, Greenhoof.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.940
If you smush them
tomaters in the slingshot,

10:12.140 --> 10:14.720
they won't break on the McColts!

10:15.140 --> 10:17.780
What are you doing? I
asked you to stop fighting!

10:18.400 --> 10:20.400
Oh, is that what you
were hollerin' about?

10:20.720 --> 10:23.140
We thought the McColts
rubbed you the wrong way,

10:23.500 --> 10:25.980
so we tomatered them
for ya. My mistake.

10:27.180 --> 10:30.100
Stop the tomater slingshots!

10:35.980 --> 10:38.120
Reload the tomater slingshots!

10:38.320 --> 10:41.500
We're gonna paint
their mountaintop red!

10:44.660 --> 10:47.370
Well, that didn't work.
I was so sure it would.

10:58.860 --> 11:02.540
It was a good plan, but we
need to think of another one.

11:02.700 --> 11:03.520
And soon.

11:03.760 --> 11:06.920
This fight is really affecting
the animals around here.

11:09.120 --> 11:14.400
Not to worry. I'll just...find
the root of the problem

11:14.400 --> 11:15.640
and work from there!

11:19.640 --> 11:22.300
Pardon us, Ma, but do you
remember what started

11:22.300 --> 11:23.880
this whole feud in
the first place?

11:24.880 --> 11:26.460
They know what they did.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.300
They know what they did.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.820
I'm starting to think
neither of you know

11:31.820 --> 11:33.060
what either of you have done.

11:33.840 --> 11:37.680
Sure we do. Them Hooffields
did us a grave injustice

11:37.680 --> 11:39.890
some time ago for some reason.

11:40.220 --> 11:41.640
Hear, hear!

11:42.100 --> 11:44.420
O-kay, backup plan
to the backup plan.

11:45.940 --> 11:48.520
Maybe we can find some common
ground that you can bond over.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.740
What do you do when
you're not fighting?

11:50.920 --> 11:52.880
That's easy. Getting
ready to fight.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.980
What do you hope to
get out of fighting?

11:56.680 --> 11:58.710
The satisfaction of winning.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.440
Of winning what?

12:02.420 --> 12:05.700
The fight, of course. To
prove our family is the best!

12:06.880 --> 12:08.260
The best at what?

12:08.620 --> 12:11.190
Winning! Haven't
you been listenin'?

12:11.960 --> 12:14.420
So the only thing they have in
common is that they both want

12:14.420 --> 12:16.680
to win a fight and neither
of them know what it's over.

12:16.940 --> 12:19.260
How can I end this feud if I
don't know what it's about?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.160
Ooh. Maybe somepony just
needs to say they're sorry.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.110
That's a good idea.

12:25.380 --> 12:28.520
And friendship solution
#48, but we can move it up.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.180
I'm so glad you
agreed to do this!

12:32.580 --> 12:34.560
This apology cake
will go a long way

12:34.560 --> 12:36.250
to making amends
between you two.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.520
Which part of my argument
changed your mind?

12:38.820 --> 12:40.580
The part where I said the
benefits of friendship

12:40.580 --> 12:42.960
outweigh the cost of war?
Or the part where I said

12:42.960 --> 12:45.090
forgiveness is an
investment in happiness?

12:45.380 --> 12:46.540
Yeah, yeah, all of it.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.200
Wait, are you even
listening to me?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.230
Who goes there?

12:52.540 --> 12:54.230
It's Ma Hooffield--

12:54.740 --> 12:57.160
Hooffield alert! Arm the canons!

12:58.760 --> 13:00.980
--with an apology cake.

13:02.460 --> 13:06.760
Did you say...cake? As in, cake?

13:08.240 --> 13:12.960
Consider it a gesture of
good will, from us to you.

13:14.140 --> 13:17.260
I haven't had cake in ages.

13:18.700 --> 13:19.830
Open the gates!

13:27.380 --> 13:29.500
It's such a beautiful cake.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.400
Think of this as more
than just a cake.

13:32.660 --> 13:35.240
It's the first step in the
long road to forgiveness.

13:35.620 --> 13:38.260
Nothing says let's be friends
like a cake that says

13:38.260 --> 13:39.600
"let's be friends".

13:40.120 --> 13:41.820
I wrote that in
icing on the top.

13:44.820 --> 13:46.150
For glory!

13:50.880 --> 13:54.800
McColts! Assume delta
force formation!

14:02.160 --> 14:02.940
Ready?

14:04.540 --> 14:05.380
Aim!

14:06.940 --> 14:08.020
Fire!

14:17.220 --> 14:20.480
Ma Hooffield! You planted
ponies in that cake?

14:20.800 --> 14:24.900
Yeah. Wait, were you
serious about apologizing?

14:25.680 --> 14:27.700
Why in Equestria
would we do that?

14:28.080 --> 14:29.940
We didn't do anything wrong!

14:30.880 --> 14:32.540
What are you talkin' about?

14:32.780 --> 14:35.130
You've done so
many things wrong!

14:35.480 --> 14:37.970
Not as many as you!

15:04.920 --> 15:07.040
If you could just
not yell so much,

15:07.040 --> 15:09.640
or maybe stop saying
words altogether...

15:14.040 --> 15:15.010
Agh!

15:15.010 --> 15:16.080
Twilight?

15:29.200 --> 15:32.660
Um, Twilight? We should
probably get back there.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.880
I mean, if you need
a break, that's fine

15:34.880 --> 15:37.460
but I really can't
do this without you.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.970
I don't know if we
can do this at all.

15:39.970 --> 15:41.600
Even if I make things right,

15:41.880 --> 15:43.440
they're just going
to fight again.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.640
Hey, little fellas. That's
OK. You can come out.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.090
What was that?

16:04.520 --> 16:08.200
Oh, you poor things! There
isn't enough food here for you.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.640
Brr! And you're freezing! I'm
gonna take you all home with me

16:13.640 --> 16:17.070
and get you all hot cocoas. How
do you feel about book clubs?

16:17.240 --> 16:18.280
I don't get it.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.440
This was supposed to be
the most beautiful valley

16:20.440 --> 16:23.000
in all of Equestria.
What happened?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.480
What's that?

16:26.800 --> 16:27.720
Oh.

16:28.120 --> 16:28.960
Uh huh.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.050
Twilight! They know what
happened here!

16:32.440 --> 16:33.480
What?

16:38.680 --> 16:40.880
Stop! You have to listen to me!

16:44.400 --> 16:46.560
EVERYPONY FREEZE!

16:52.200 --> 16:54.360
Fluttershy, you
have to tell them!

16:55.560 --> 16:58.160
It's a lot harder to
freeze an army of ponies

16:58.160 --> 16:59.680
than just six of them.

17:03.960 --> 17:07.600
Before you keep fighting, there
is something you should know.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.190
Long ago, there were
two best friends...

17:11.400 --> 17:13.760
...Grub Hooffield
and Piles McColt.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.330
When they found the valley
between the Smokey Mountains,

17:16.640 --> 17:18.560
they knew it was
something special.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.760
So they made a promise to each
other to protect and preserve

17:22.760 --> 17:25.920
the valley for all its
adorable furry inhabitants.

17:26.320 --> 17:29.200
But, they disagreed
on how to go about it.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.880
Grub wanted to start
by planting crops

17:32.880 --> 17:35.200
so that everypony would
have something to eat.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.400
But Piles thought it
would be better to start

17:37.400 --> 17:41.200
by building a shelter to protect
them against the cold and wind.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.220
The two ponies were unable
to come to an understanding.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.960
So Piles went ahead and
built a shelter anyway,

17:48.120 --> 17:50.560
exactly where Grub was
going to start his farm.

17:53.240 --> 17:57.440
Grub was upset, so he
tore down Piles' shelter

17:57.440 --> 17:58.920
so he could plant his crops.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.760
They kept fighting,
back and forth,

18:02.920 --> 18:04.720
until it turned into a feud.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.830
The valley suffered from
the constant destruction

18:25.000 --> 18:27.880
until finally the
Hooffields and McColts moved

18:27.880 --> 18:29.360
to separate mountains.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.310
Even then, the valley and
all the animals in it

18:34.440 --> 18:37.200
continued to be caught
in the crossfire.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.520
You see, by fighting, you're
destroying the very thing

18:41.520 --> 18:43.520
that brought you here
in the first place.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.600
So it's time you both put
your differences aside

18:46.960 --> 18:49.840
and come together, if
not for yourselves,

18:50.120 --> 18:53.360
then for the sake of these
cute and cuddly guys.

18:57.640 --> 19:02.300
Aw, shucks. We never meant
to hurt you little critters.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.680
Yeah, we're sorry.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.210
They say they
accept your apology!

19:13.400 --> 19:16.840
Um, Princess? You
can unfreeze us now.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.040
Oh, right.

19:24.160 --> 19:28.690
Ma Hooffield? We promise we
won't fight you no more.

19:29.080 --> 19:33.160
Us too. Except we
promise not to fight you.

19:33.560 --> 19:37.640
I suppose it doesn't matter
who's right. We're both wrong.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.360
That's one thing
we can agree on.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.510
This is wonderful!

19:47.800 --> 19:49.960
I am so proud of you two.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.360
Thanks, Princess.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.400
Though I would just
like to point out

19:55.400 --> 19:59.560
that I was the first
to admit I was wrong.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.230
That may be, but I promised
not to fight first.

20:02.230 --> 20:03.500
That counts for more.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.040
Oh, yeah?

20:11.360 --> 20:14.360
Oh, all right. We don't
have to speak animal

20:14.360 --> 20:17.040
to know what y'all
are sayin'. Truce?

20:17.240 --> 20:18.380
Truce.

20:35.600 --> 20:39.120
Hoo-wee, ain't that
a pretty sight!

20:39.600 --> 20:40.800
Sure is.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.560
The McColts are going to
help us rebuild our homes --

20:44.840 --> 20:46.240
good ones this time.

20:46.410 --> 20:49.800
And the Hooffields are going
to help us grow some crops.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.200
Not pumpkins!

20:52.200 --> 20:55.310
Thanks for teaching us that
friendship is so much better

20:55.480 --> 20:57.580
than winning a silly argument.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.240
Yay! I told you
we'd figure it out.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.040
We did. And we didn't need my
friendship portfolio to do it.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.000
We just needed each other.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.400
So what do you think
will happen next?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.400
We've all been called
by the map now.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.080
I'm sure we'll find
out when we get home.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.810
What if it summons all six
of us to another place?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.320
Or another pony we
weren't expecting?

21:25.320 --> 21:27.600
What if it wants us to solve
other kinds of problems like

21:27.600 --> 21:30.600
quantum physics or why the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree?
