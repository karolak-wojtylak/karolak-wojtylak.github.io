00:16.600 --> 00:19.720
I'll never understand
the ponies in this town.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.100
Everywhere I went, they
were all gussied up

00:22.100 --> 00:23.450
and looking at me funny.

00:23.860 --> 00:26.000
Kept asking if I
was nervous.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.640
Did they forget the
wedding is tomorrow?

00:29.220 --> 00:31.400
Ah, maybe they're
just as excited

00:31.400 --> 00:33.300
for us to be
married as I am.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.860
Aw!

00:36.400 --> 00:38.960
Well, they're going
to feel awfully silly

00:38.960 --> 00:41.340
when they realize they've
got the wrong date.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.740
THE INVITATIONS ARE WRONG!

00:44.820 --> 00:46.740
THIS SAYS THE WEDDING IS TODAY!

00:47.080 --> 00:48.960
But I got such a
good deal on them.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.360
Everypony in
town got these!

00:51.520 --> 00:53.320
The princesses have even RSVP'd!

00:53.540 --> 00:55.400
I told you we
should have eloped!

00:55.720 --> 00:56.280
Oh dear!

00:56.480 --> 00:59.040
The caterer, the
flowers, the musicians!

00:59.180 --> 01:00.800
We've got to move
it all to today!

01:01.160 --> 01:01.680
What?

01:02.580 --> 01:04.120
Where's my wedding planner?

01:08.640 --> 01:11.100
You told me you could do it for
half what the others charge!

01:11.230 --> 01:13.080
And then you
sent invitations

01:13.080 --> 01:15.780
to everypony in town
with the wrong date!

01:19.100 --> 01:19.780
Muffin?

01:28.040 --> 01:37.960
Regular subtitles by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

02:01.740 --> 02:04.420
I really messed up
on those invitations.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.260
I feel just awful, Doc.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.340
Hmph. Perhaps that explains
why I never got mine.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.380
I told Cranky I could get
'em printed for cheap,

02:13.680 --> 02:16.600
but that meant hiring
somepony with no experience

02:16.600 --> 02:18.120
using a printing press.

02:22.780 --> 02:25.610
Oh, I wish there was a way
I could go back in time

02:25.610 --> 02:26.800
and fix all this.

02:30.140 --> 02:33.060
Going back in time is
old thinking, my friend.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.620
I was working off a
cutting edge theory

02:35.620 --> 02:38.340
of making time come
forward to you!

02:41.390 --> 02:44.020
My life's work, decades,
hm, centuries really,

02:44.020 --> 02:45.860
of research and experimentation.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.160
And I nearly had it cracked.

02:47.380 --> 02:50.260
Turns out there's a
magic spell for it. Who knew?

02:54.080 --> 02:57.680
But there are so many
things that magic can't explain!

02:57.880 --> 03:00.580
Where science and mathematics
are the real magic!

03:00.680 --> 03:01.440
Like these?

03:02.100 --> 03:03.020
They're pretty!

03:03.400 --> 03:06.160
Ah, yes. My flameless fireworks.

03:06.380 --> 03:08.420
I never could quite figure
out how to get them to ignite.

03:08.650 --> 03:11.660
How did you learn to make
all this stuff, anyway?

03:12.160 --> 03:14.520
I've been studying
science my whole life!

03:14.920 --> 03:17.820
Ever since a particularly
traumatic experience as a foal,

03:18.060 --> 03:19.640
I've been looking for
ways to make sense

03:19.640 --> 03:20.640
of the world around me.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.780
Science provides
explanations of things

03:22.780 --> 03:24.480
we never thought possible!

03:26.060 --> 03:27.640
Now. Why did we
come here again?

03:29.080 --> 03:30.120
Yeah, oh!

03:30.340 --> 03:32.960
Because I accidentally
sent out invitations

03:32.960 --> 03:34.720
for Cranky and
Matilda's wedding

03:34.720 --> 03:37.420
with today's date
instead of tomorrow's.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.040
Great whickering stallions,
I completely forgot!

03:41.360 --> 03:43.200
And I still need to
get my suit tailored!

03:49.080 --> 03:49.740
Rarity?

03:50.680 --> 03:51.560
Rarity!

03:59.320 --> 04:01.760
Please, you've got to help me!

04:03.080 --> 04:04.600
I lost track of
time, unbelievably,

04:04.600 --> 04:06.540
and forgot that the
wedding is this afternoon!

04:11.960 --> 04:13.260
Have you seen Rarity?

04:13.380 --> 04:15.000
She's got to alter the
sleeves of my suit

04:15.000 --> 04:16.420
and she's got to do it now!

04:17.780 --> 04:19.440
Oh, ha ha! Thank goodness!

04:19.620 --> 04:20.660
Lead on, my friend!

04:30.270 --> 04:32.220
Why have you brought me here?

04:32.220 --> 04:33.430
Rarity would never
set hoof in...

04:40.040 --> 04:42.760
Great whickering stallions,
they've got style!

04:44.440 --> 04:45.480
Gentlecolts!

04:45.600 --> 04:49.080
I'm facing certain calamity
and I couldn't help noticing

04:49.080 --> 04:50.660
your remarkable
fashion sense!

04:51.020 --> 04:53.500
Could I get the name of
your incredible tailor?

04:53.900 --> 04:56.320
Well, yeah man, his
name is me.

04:56.820 --> 04:59.060
Me. What an unfortunate name.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.140
No, man, like, I manufacture
all my own garments.

05:03.140 --> 05:04.400
We all do, man.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.280
Then you've got to help me!
I need this suit tailored!

05:07.280 --> 05:08.120
It's an emergency!

05:08.200 --> 05:12.510
Ha ha ha. Sorry, man, we're
just about to start the finals.

05:13.380 --> 05:16.600
What's this word
you keep using... "man"?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.700
I don't know, man,
but guess what?

05:19.100 --> 05:20.680
Our fourth didn't show.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.320
So if you roll with us,
we'll alter your suit for ya.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.040
I'm sorry, gentlecolts,
but I will not bowl.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.330
The splits! The spares! There
are simply too many variables!

05:39.800 --> 05:42.620
Variables? What are you
talkin' about, man?

05:42.620 --> 05:44.300
Just throw the ball straight.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.980
Hold on. Straight?

05:49.380 --> 05:53.280
Very well. I'll try your
"straight" technique.

05:53.660 --> 05:55.700
It just might be
crazy enough to work.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.690
Do we know what
they're on about?

06:03.380 --> 06:05.000
The way they're
huddled up like that?

06:05.220 --> 06:08.340
I'd say it's either a friendship
problem or a monster attack.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.900
A monster attack? Blast!

06:11.140 --> 06:13.380
I'm performing at the
ceremony this afternoon

06:13.380 --> 06:15.840
and I still haven't
sorted out what to play.

06:16.340 --> 06:19.540
How am I meant to practice with
a monster invading Ponyville?

06:19.860 --> 06:21.460
Maybe it's just a
friendship problem

06:21.580 --> 06:23.800
and it'll all be cleared up
in a half an hour or so.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.940
Ugh. I hope so.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.800
Where's Pinkie Pie? I need
my wedding planner!

06:46.420 --> 06:48.900
Oh no! On my wedding day?

06:49.060 --> 06:51.480
SOMEPONY'S GOT TO HELP ME!

06:55.640 --> 06:56.440
You!

06:57.060 --> 06:57.720
Me?

06:57.960 --> 07:01.140
I need to move an entire
wedding from tomorrow to today!

07:01.320 --> 07:03.300
But nopony's asked me
to organize anything

07:03.300 --> 07:04.720
since Twilight came to town!

07:05.000 --> 07:05.880
So you'll do it?

07:06.480 --> 07:10.020
I used to be the best
organizer in all of Ponyville.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.260
You bet I'll--

07:13.520 --> 07:14.180
Ahh!

07:17.560 --> 07:19.140
Come on, we'd better
get to the salon

07:19.140 --> 07:20.960
before that monster
flattens it!

07:28.680 --> 07:30.920
What am I gonna do?

07:32.480 --> 07:33.340
Matilda!

07:33.580 --> 07:36.160
I feel so bad about
the invitations!

07:36.500 --> 07:38.120
Is there anything I can do?

07:38.120 --> 07:39.900
FLOWERS!

07:42.260 --> 07:45.060
You want Matilda's
arrangements today?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.280
This is awful!

07:48.400 --> 07:50.540
The horror! The horror!

07:50.800 --> 07:53.120
So there's no way you can do it?

07:53.500 --> 07:55.520
We don't even have
Matilda's flowers in yet,

07:55.780 --> 07:56.720
much less arranged.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.840
Oh. This is a disaster!

07:59.360 --> 08:01.480
Okay. Thanks anyway.

08:04.820 --> 08:05.540
Look, girls!

08:06.480 --> 08:08.540
A broken stem on
one of the zinnias!

08:08.760 --> 08:09.680
WHAT?

08:11.260 --> 08:12.980
Oh the horror!

08:13.200 --> 08:14.600
The horror!

08:16.740 --> 08:19.140
I have to admit, when Matilda
said we needed this place

08:19.140 --> 08:21.360
ready by today, I was
a little nervous.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.940
With you by my side, I knew
we'd get it done in time.

08:24.940 --> 08:28.320
There is nothing like a
best friend, is there?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.640
Anything's possible
when you know somepony

08:30.640 --> 08:32.380
as well as we know each other.

08:35.020 --> 08:36.100
What was that?

08:36.300 --> 08:38.640
There's some monster attacking
Ponyville or something.

08:39.020 --> 08:42.120
What is it this time, a creature
from the Ever-Free Forest?

08:42.420 --> 08:45.140
Uh, I think it's
some sort of Bugbear.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.500
Did you say Bugbear?

08:48.240 --> 08:49.380
He found me.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.480
What are you talking
about, Bon Bon?

08:52.920 --> 08:56.380
My name isn't Bon Bon; it's
Special Agent Sweetie Drops.

08:56.540 --> 09:00.080
I work for a super-secret
anti-monster agency in Canterlot.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.260
Or at least I did until the
Bugbear went missing

09:02.260 --> 09:03.840
from Tartarus a few years back.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.420
What are you talking about?

09:06.700 --> 09:09.300
When it escaped, we had to
shutter the whole agency.

09:09.540 --> 09:10.860
Every last shred of evidence

09:10.860 --> 09:13.040
of the organization's
existence was destroyed.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.720
Celestia demanded
complete deniability.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.160
What?

09:18.400 --> 09:20.020
It was me who
captured the Bugbear.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.880
I had to go deep cover
here in Ponyville

09:21.880 --> 09:23.340
and assume the name Bon Bon.

09:23.740 --> 09:25.740
I never thought it'd
be able to track me.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.640
But now it has.

09:27.980 --> 09:31.840
Are you saying our whole
friendship was based on a lie?

09:32.240 --> 09:35.760
I'm sorry, Lyra, I couldn't tell
you for your own protection.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.020
But, but the lunches,
the, the long talks,

09:39.280 --> 09:40.460
the benches we've sat on!

09:40.780 --> 09:42.300
None of that was real?

09:43.200 --> 09:44.320
It was all real.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.400
You're my very best friend.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.820
I've got to go find a
crowd to blend into

09:52.820 --> 09:54.060
before I put you in danger.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.300
I'll see you at the wedding.

09:56.780 --> 09:59.140
Fine. But we're going to
talk about this later!

10:01.080 --> 10:03.600
I need my ring today,
no matter the cost!

10:04.100 --> 10:06.060
As long as it doesn't
cost any extra.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.360
7-10 split, man.
Harshest of the harsh.

10:11.860 --> 10:15.320
But if you pick this up,
we win the whole shebang.

10:18.700 --> 10:22.240
Doc! I finally figured
out how I can help!

10:22.560 --> 10:25.560
Your flameless fireworks
look just like flowers!

10:25.760 --> 10:27.440
I'll use them for the wedding!

10:28.280 --> 10:30.840
Great whickering
stallions. Wait!

10:39.860 --> 10:40.360
Wait!

10:40.460 --> 10:42.920
The flameless fireworks
are extremely volatile!

10:43.040 --> 10:44.600
Without knowing
what the trigger is,

10:44.600 --> 10:46.120
they could go off at any moment!

10:47.520 --> 10:49.060
My word, is that a Bugbear?

10:54.440 --> 10:56.880
There are so many
things I'm forgetting!

10:57.200 --> 10:59.800
I hope Cranky remembers
to tell the musicians.

10:59.940 --> 11:03.960
Oh, oh! I'll never get
my mane done in time!

11:04.180 --> 11:08.600
You must relax, my dear!
We can handle anything.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.640
We once did a pony's
hair during the ceremony.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.080
Oh, it's true!
It's true!

11:15.080 --> 11:16.760
They really are the best!

11:17.000 --> 11:21.160
Matilda, I've just got to say I
already feel like we're family.

11:21.780 --> 11:22.520
You do?

11:22.860 --> 11:23.800
Of course!

11:24.160 --> 11:27.280
I'm Stephen Magnet,
Cranky's best beast!

11:27.760 --> 11:29.140
You're Stephen Magnet?

11:29.580 --> 11:30.820
Well, what'd you
expect, a Bugbear?

11:31.300 --> 11:33.920
I've known Cranky forever!

11:34.160 --> 11:35.900
Surely he must have told
you about the time

11:35.900 --> 11:38.680
he saved me from
Flashfreeze Lake.

11:39.540 --> 11:40.780
You're Stephen Magnet?

11:41.120 --> 11:43.060
Oh, I know, I KNOW!

11:43.060 --> 11:46.020
Typical Cranky to leave
out minor details,

11:46.020 --> 11:49.560
like the fact that I'm, you
know, a sea monster, right?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.920
Oh, I just love that old burro.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.180
I'm sorry, Stephen, I guess
I assumed you were a pony.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.700
And I had no idea you had
such adventures together.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.680
Oh, honey! You don't
know the half of it.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.300
But let me tell you something:

12:05.460 --> 12:07.240
in all that we've been
through together,

12:07.420 --> 12:11.240
the only thing he ever
cared about was finding you.

12:12.680 --> 12:13.340
Really?

12:13.780 --> 12:16.240
Well, that and a
baldness cure.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.000
He is the sweetest
thing, isn't he?

12:19.540 --> 12:21.720
All the stress I've
put myself through.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.500
All the stress I've
put him through!

12:23.740 --> 12:26.720
The only thing that matters
is that we're together.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.300
The wedding isn't the important
thing; the marriage is.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.260
Oh, my goodness gracious!

12:33.620 --> 12:37.320
If you believe that, I have
got a bridge to sell you!

12:37.700 --> 12:39.900
All these ponies
travelling to Ponyville,

12:39.900 --> 12:41.640
putting on
uncomfortable clothes,

12:41.720 --> 12:43.400
sitting through a
long ceremony...

12:43.400 --> 12:46.140
you think any of them
care about the marriage?

12:47.620 --> 12:52.580
Honey, the wedding
is EVERYTHING!

13:06.700 --> 13:10.760
Ugh, all these wedding
songs are so standard.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.600
I want Matilda and Cranky's
wedding to be special.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.820
Thanks, but I'm not sure that's
appropriate for a wedding, is it?

13:57.200 --> 13:58.500
That's more like it!

14:47.980 --> 14:48.620
STOP!

14:49.000 --> 14:51.020
I'm going to be late
for the wedding!

15:54.260 --> 15:55.160
What is life?

15:55.720 --> 15:58.820
Is it nothing more than the
endless search for a Cutie Mark?

15:59.420 --> 16:02.400
And what is a Cutie Mark
but a constant reminder

16:02.400 --> 16:06.320
that we're all only one Bugbear
attack away from oblivion?

16:06.900 --> 16:10.460
And what of the poor
gator, flank forever blank,

16:10.780 --> 16:14.340
destined to an existential
swim down the river of life

16:14.340 --> 16:16.820
to an unknowable destiny?

16:26.820 --> 16:28.320
Something like that might work.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.880
What do you mean, you
left it on the counter?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.460
I thought you
were bringing it!

16:35.900 --> 16:37.720
Well, this is
just wonderful.

16:41.580 --> 16:44.140
I handled the gift for
Cadance and Shining Armor.

16:44.380 --> 16:46.620
You were supposed to
do this one, remember?

16:46.920 --> 16:50.080
Well, we can't just come to
this wedding empty-hoofed!

16:53.280 --> 16:55.700
It's all right. He always
cries at weddings.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.500
Usually it's not until
the wedding starts.

17:01.860 --> 17:05.180
These flameless fireworks
look even better than flowers!

17:06.480 --> 17:08.020
Attention, everypony!

17:08.240 --> 17:09.280
Our friends have done it!

17:09.540 --> 17:11.540
They've defeated the Bugbear!

17:15.500 --> 17:16.040
Hey.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.120
Hello.

17:18.360 --> 17:21.980
So, uh,you didn't happen to
mention our earlier conversation

17:21.980 --> 17:26.920
about my secret identity
to anypony, did you?

17:27.940 --> 17:29.560
No. I did not.

17:30.740 --> 17:33.440
And you're not the only one
with a secret, you know.

17:33.740 --> 17:36.140
You know those
expensive imported oats

17:36.140 --> 17:38.320
you were saving for
a special occasion?

17:38.720 --> 17:40.440
I cooked them up and
ate them.

17:40.860 --> 17:41.620
All of them.

17:44.160 --> 17:44.740
Whew!

17:45.280 --> 17:47.960
It's sort of thrilling to reveal
your deepest, darkest secrets!

17:48.160 --> 17:51.520
That's what
best friends are for!

17:56.980 --> 18:01.120
Next time you can just bring your
own gift and I'll bring mine.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.160
Fine.

18:04.000 --> 18:04.580
There you are!

18:05.900 --> 18:07.020
My suit has
vanished and this

18:07.020 --> 18:08.480
was the only thing
left in my closet.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.120
How do I look?

18:10.460 --> 18:12.460
Like a million bits!

18:13.700 --> 18:16.180
Great whickering stallions!
Look at the time!

18:16.560 --> 18:19.000
We'd better get
inside. Allons-y!

18:22.020 --> 18:24.960
I can't believe I lost my hair!

18:25.200 --> 18:26.480
I look ridiculous!

18:26.840 --> 18:29.180
The love of my life
deserves better than this!

18:29.480 --> 18:31.660
Have no fear, Cranky, my dear!

18:31.900 --> 18:35.720
It's Stephen Magnet's
moustache to the rescue!

18:42.080 --> 18:44.060
Aw, thanks, buddy.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.860
No problem.

18:46.180 --> 18:49.360
Now you get in there
and marry that donkey!

18:50.940 --> 18:53.160
Well? Is everypony here?

18:55.380 --> 18:56.880
All set, Mayor!

18:57.400 --> 19:00.220
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here today

19:00.220 --> 19:02.420
to join these two
in maretrimony.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.780
As I look around this room,
I can only imagine

19:05.780 --> 19:08.520
how uncomfortable
Cranky must be.

19:13.760 --> 19:18.300
But I also see so many ponies
from all trots of life

19:18.720 --> 19:21.040
brought together by love.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.660
Cranky searched all across
this great land of ours

19:24.820 --> 19:26.020
to find Matilda.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.000
And no matter what
obstacles kept them apart,

19:29.300 --> 19:31.480
love would finally
bring them together,

19:31.840 --> 19:35.300
just as it has brought
all of us together now.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.740
It's remarkable to
me how a story

19:37.740 --> 19:40.720
like Cranky's search for
Matilda could fill this room

19:40.720 --> 19:42.960
with such a unique
collection of ponies.

19:43.260 --> 19:45.940
It makes you realize
that everypony

19:45.940 --> 19:48.300
is the star of their own story.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.580
And it's not just the main
characters in our stories

19:51.580 --> 19:53.020
that make life so rich.

19:55.340 --> 19:56.860
It's everypony, those
who play big parts

19:57.100 --> 19:59.260
and those who play small.

20:00.540 --> 20:02.700
If it weren't for
everypony in this room

20:02.860 --> 20:05.020
and many more who
couldn't be here today,

20:05.320 --> 20:08.160
Cranky and Matilda's lives
wouldn't be as full

20:08.160 --> 20:10.300
and vibrant as they are.

20:14.220 --> 20:17.220
And so, in front of all
these loved ones...

20:17.600 --> 20:22.540
Cranky, do you take this donkey
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

20:22.960 --> 20:24.440
You bet I do.

20:24.980 --> 20:28.060
And do you, Matilda,
take this donkey

20:28.060 --> 20:30.120
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

20:31.700 --> 20:32.660
I do.

20:33.340 --> 20:39.180
Then I'm proud to say, I now
pronounce you jack and jenny!

20:58.880 --> 21:02.400
Of course! They need
love to ignite!

21:02.600 --> 21:04.520
How could I have missed it?

21:12.520 --> 21:14.080
You know something, girls?

21:14.260 --> 21:17.120
We are so lucky to
live in this town.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.180
I love you all.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.540
Ow! That's
where the Bugbear bit me.

21:25.000 --> 21:25.480
Sorry.
