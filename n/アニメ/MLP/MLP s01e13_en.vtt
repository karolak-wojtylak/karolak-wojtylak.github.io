00:04.066 --> 00:08.601
Hoowee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who
works with her head in the clouds.

00:08.602 --> 00:11.457
Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?

00:11.458 --> 00:13.130
I know I can.

00:16.339 --> 00:18.016
Oh, for Pete's sake!

00:18.017 --> 00:22.407
Heh! Looks like this pegasus can
pitch better than the workhorse.

00:22.523 --> 00:26.282
The object of the game is to
get the closest to the stake.

00:26.446 --> 00:30.214
Alright, alright.
You got another throw there, pony girl.

00:32.406 --> 00:36.360
Wow, Rainbow! Heh. You couldn't hit the
barn door with that kind of a throw.

00:36.361 --> 00:41.850
Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest
throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it.

00:47.829 --> 00:50.070
Yeehaw! It's a ringer.

00:50.071 --> 00:52.409
That's how you do it down here on the farm.

00:52.410 --> 00:53.805
I lost.

00:54.034 --> 00:57.158
Oh, don't feel bad, Rainbow.
It's all in good fun.

00:57.159 --> 00:59.237
I hate losing.

00:59.238 --> 01:03.206
Besides, you're a mighty good athlete.
I'm just better, heh heh heh...

01:03.207 --> 01:07.397
Alright, Applejack! You think you're
the top athlete in all of Ponyville?

01:07.398 --> 01:11.857
Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria,
but that might be gilding the lily.

01:11.858 --> 01:15.444
And I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it!

01:15.445 --> 01:16.498
Prove what?

01:16.499 --> 01:20.315
I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition.

01:21.214 --> 01:25.892
A series of athletic contests to decide
who's the best once and for all!

01:26.533 --> 01:29.419
You know what, Rainbow? You're on!

02:13.879 --> 02:16.029
So you two are doing what now?

02:16.030 --> 02:18.346
-An Iron...
-Iron Pony competition.

02:19.063 --> 02:22.109
See, we've set up a bunch of events
to decide which one of us is...

02:22.110 --> 02:24.514
The most athletic pony ever!

02:25.736 --> 02:26.953
And I'm here to...

02:26.954 --> 02:31.477
Uh... I don' know! Why is she here?

02:31.554 --> 02:33.375
To be our judge and keep score.

02:33.376 --> 02:38.710
Right, heh! Somepony's gotta record
my awesomeness for the history books.

02:41.699 --> 02:46.901
Hello everypony and welcome to
the first annual Iron Pony competition!

02:46.994 --> 02:49.847
Uh... Spike? Who are you talking to?

02:49.934 --> 02:52.108
Um... Them!

02:54.000 --> 02:55.940
Let the games begin!

03:00.772 --> 03:03.235
Ready, set, go!

03:09.307 --> 03:10.707
Dagnabit!

03:11.362 --> 03:12.327
Time, Spike?

03:12.328 --> 03:13.759
17 seconds.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.052
You're kiddin'. That breaks my
record from last year's rodeo.

03:17.188 --> 03:20.957
But you got a five second
penalty for nudging the barrel.

03:21.330 --> 03:22.813
Nuts n' screws!

03:23.041 --> 03:25.983
Still, that's 22 seconds. Not too shabby.

03:27.204 --> 03:30.818
Hey, don't be nervous.
Remember, it's all in good fun.

03:31.067 --> 03:32.887
Now git on up there!

03:33.747 --> 03:35.425
Ready, set, go!

03:40.904 --> 03:44.317
Whoo! That was some fancy
hoofwork there, Rainbow!

03:44.659 --> 03:47.894
Thanks! But I couldn't have been as fast as you.

03:47.948 --> 03:49.517
What was the time on that, Spike?

03:49.735 --> 03:51.507
18 seconds!

03:52.168 --> 03:53.728
18 seconds?!

03:53.729 --> 03:57.034
Rainbow, are you sure you're
not secretly a rodeo pony?

03:57.192 --> 03:59.757
Rainbow Dash wins the Barrel Weave!

04:01.636 --> 04:03.504
I can't believe I won!

04:03.505 --> 04:06.392
Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it!

04:13.719 --> 04:18.571
Mighty respectable, but let me
show you how it's really done.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.953
Years of applebuckin'.

04:31.026 --> 04:32.146
Why me?

04:32.471 --> 04:33.591
Go!

04:43.042 --> 04:44.957
Ready for another pony ride?

04:44.958 --> 04:45.857
No...

04:45.858 --> 04:46.978
Go!

04:50.526 --> 04:53.035
Rainbow Dash wins the Bronco Buck!

04:54.522 --> 04:55.926
And I lose...

05:07.237 --> 05:09.463
How I get roped into these things...

05:12.907 --> 05:14.438
Does this count?

05:52.023 --> 05:54.210
Fillies and gentlecolts!

05:54.918 --> 05:59.708
At the halfway point our
competitors are tied at 5 and 5!

05:59.709 --> 06:01.529
Who are you talking to?

06:01.573 --> 06:02.693
Them!

06:06.102 --> 06:07.638
95...

06:07.717 --> 06:09.367
96...

06:09.604 --> 06:11.399
97...

06:11.724 --> 06:13.458
98...

06:14.291 --> 06:16.368
99...

06:17.182 --> 06:19.076
-A hundred!
-Yes!

06:21.339 --> 06:23.361
Be a good sport, Applejack.

06:55.363 --> 06:59.861
All right, you two. This is the final event.
Give it all you've got!

07:05.055 --> 07:08.225
Looks like the workhorse might
come out ahead in this one.

07:12.171 --> 07:15.961
[That's not fair! You can't use
your wings to help you win!]

07:16.606 --> 07:18.124
[You're cheatin'!]

07:18.125 --> 07:21.524
[I can't understand you with
that rope in your mouth.]

07:21.610 --> 07:23.767
I SAID...! Uh-oh.

07:27.304 --> 07:29.406
I win by a landslide!

07:30.005 --> 07:32.539
Or mudslide in your case.

07:34.574 --> 07:36.980
I am the Iron Pony!

07:36.981 --> 07:38.773
Only 'cos you cheated!

07:38.774 --> 07:39.894
What?

07:40.225 --> 07:44.370
You used your wingpower to help
you win over half those contests!

07:44.371 --> 07:46.493
Sounds like sour apples to me.

07:46.494 --> 07:49.285
Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?

07:49.286 --> 07:53.044
Well... no. But you never said
I couldn't use my wings.

07:53.045 --> 07:56.261
I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.

07:56.300 --> 07:58.814
I still would have won even without my wings.

07:58.815 --> 08:00.383
Hah! Prove it.

08:00.384 --> 08:02.479
Gladly. How?

08:02.480 --> 08:07.020
Tomorrow's the annual Runnin' of the Leaves.
I challenge you to race me in it!

08:07.021 --> 08:09.881
Heh! Easy shmeasy.

08:09.882 --> 08:11.024
Hold on!

08:11.306 --> 08:17.306
There is one condition: the point is to *run*.
So no wings allowed!

08:17.307 --> 08:18.707
No wings?

08:19.295 --> 08:20.695
No problem!

08:34.312 --> 08:37.220
Twilight, hurry up!
We're gonna be late for the race.

08:37.221 --> 08:40.612
Why are you so excited about the race?
It's only for ponies.

08:40.613 --> 08:43.070
Yeah, but I'm hoping I can
be the announcer again.

08:43.071 --> 08:45.830
Just listen: Fillies and gentlecolts...

08:45.831 --> 08:48.650
Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves!

08:48.651 --> 08:53.429
This is Pinkie Pie, your official
eye-in-the-sky announcer.

08:55.640 --> 08:59.004
Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken.

08:59.186 --> 09:02.390
As everypony knows, the Running
is very important tradition...

09:02.391 --> 09:06.027
...for without it, the autumn leaves
of Equestria would never fall.

09:06.028 --> 09:10.873
So get ready, ponies. The Running of
the Leaves will begin in 5 minutes.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.052
Pardon me! Excuse me!

09:19.255 --> 09:21.413
Make way for the Iron Pony!

09:21.414 --> 09:23.265
The Iron Phony, you mean.

09:23.266 --> 09:27.389
So, Applejack. You ready to win second place?

09:27.390 --> 09:29.926
I'm ready to run a good, clean race!

09:29.927 --> 09:31.243
Yeah, yeah...

09:31.443 --> 09:33.943
You are not allowed to use your wings!

09:33.944 --> 09:37.614
I could win this race with both
wings tied behind my back.

09:41.797 --> 09:45.829
Trussed up like a turkey.
Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is.

09:45.830 --> 09:47.231
Very funny.

09:47.373 --> 09:50.203
'least now we know we're racin' fair and square.

09:50.204 --> 09:53.249
Racers! Please take your position.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.269
Um... Pinkie Pie?

09:55.270 --> 09:56.900
Hey, Spike! What's up?

09:56.901 --> 09:58.979
Oh wait, it me! I'm up!

10:00.044 --> 10:03.554
Uh, yeah, uh... I know you're doing
the announcing today and stuff and...

10:03.555 --> 10:07.047
I'm sure you're gonna do a great job
and all, but... I was just wondering...

10:07.048 --> 10:07.920
What?

10:07.921 --> 10:09.743
Uh... Forget it!

10:10.108 --> 10:11.048
Spike!

10:11.707 --> 10:16.079
Would you like to be my co-reporter?
We could comment on the action together!

10:16.080 --> 10:17.168
We could?

10:17.936 --> 10:19.542
Climb on up!

10:23.470 --> 10:26.492
Twilight? What in tarnation
are you doin' up here?

10:26.493 --> 10:27.739
I'm racing!

10:30.055 --> 10:31.982
Good one, Twilight!

10:32.279 --> 10:33.727
I'm not joking.

10:33.728 --> 10:34.692
What?!

10:34.971 --> 10:39.012
You're not an athlete, you're a...
well... you're an egghead.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.575
I am not an egghead! I am well read.

10:41.576 --> 10:42.976
Egghead.

10:44.120 --> 10:47.390
But ha... have you ever run a race?

10:47.391 --> 10:51.113
Well, no. But I do know a lot about running.

10:51.114 --> 10:52.822
And you know this from...

10:52.823 --> 10:55.462
Books. I've read several on the subject.

10:58.348 --> 11:01.607
What'd you read?
The "Egghead's Guide to Running"?

11:01.907 --> 11:06.134
Di... di... did you stretch out
your eye muscles to warm up?

11:06.326 --> 11:08.116
HA HA HA HA!

11:09.081 --> 11:10.784
Get it? Eye muscles!

11:11.058 --> 11:15.366
Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the Running
of the leaves is a Ponyville tradition.

11:15.367 --> 11:19.585
And since I'm here to learn, I've
decided I should experience it myself.

11:19.586 --> 11:22.856
Well, I think that's just
dandy, Twilight. Good luck!

11:24.325 --> 11:26.746
Yeah! See you at the finish line!

11:26.747 --> 11:28.147
Tomorrow.

11:30.594 --> 11:33.886
All right, ponies! Are you ready?

11:33.887 --> 11:35.287
Get set!

11:37.591 --> 11:39.259
And they're off!

11:39.260 --> 11:43.002
Welcome to the official coverage
of the Running of the Leaves.

11:43.003 --> 11:46.701
You know, Spike, despite its name, the
leaves don't do any of the actual running.

11:46.702 --> 11:49.203
No, that's left to My Little Ponies.

11:49.204 --> 11:53.640
Why... Yes, Pinkie. It's the running of the
ponies that causes the leaves to fall.

11:53.641 --> 11:57.396
Ugh... Those lazy, lazy leaves.

11:59.543 --> 12:01.998
But his year, the run is
about more than the weather.

12:01.999 --> 12:05.325
It's about the race to the finish
and the two runners want to win it.

12:05.326 --> 12:07.464
Applejack and Rainbow Dash.

12:07.465 --> 12:11.333
You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit
of a grudge match they're trying to settle.

12:11.334 --> 12:13.820
Trying to prove who's the most athletic.

12:13.821 --> 12:16.831
Yes and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge".

12:16.832 --> 12:19.437
Yes, it... does. What?

12:19.438 --> 12:22.644
And I like fudge. But if I eat too much
fudge, I get a pudge and then I can't budge.

12:23.630 --> 12:25.131
So... no fudge?

12:25.132 --> 12:26.845
Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast.

12:26.846 --> 12:31.276
Let's check in with our two competitive
ponies: Applejack and Rainbow Dash.

12:31.277 --> 12:34.370
Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack
and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched...

12:34.371 --> 12:35.647
...running neck and neck.

12:36.031 --> 12:39.794
But what's this? Applejack is making
the move, she's now ahead by a nose.

12:39.795 --> 12:44.124
But Rainbow Dash pulls Applejack up and
takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose.

12:44.125 --> 12:48.237
Or maybe three quarters of a nose.
No, about 63.7% of a nose...

12:49.352 --> 12:50.469
Roughly speaking.

12:50.914 --> 12:54.118
Applejack sees this move and pushes
forth with her strong workhorse legs...

12:54.119 --> 12:56.760
...slinking ahead by 350 noses!

12:57.430 --> 12:59.140
Not so easy without wings, is it?

13:00.406 --> 13:03.146
Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash!

13:04.614 --> 13:09.951
Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash
is catching up the frontrunner Applejack.

13:10.093 --> 13:13.714
What an upset! I thought
Applejack had this in the bag.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.250
You didn't think I was gonna let
you off that easy, did you?

13:25.424 --> 13:26.858
I don't believe it!

13:26.859 --> 13:29.226
I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?

13:29.227 --> 13:33.071
Not the scenery, Twilight.
Rainbow Dash just tripped me.

13:33.072 --> 13:34.227
She did not.

13:34.228 --> 13:35.258
She did too!

13:35.259 --> 13:36.402
She did not!

13:36.403 --> 13:39.419
And if you slowed down and looked
where you're going, like me...

13:39.420 --> 13:41.595
...you'd see that you tripped over a rock.

13:41.711 --> 13:44.275
What? Oh, hayseed!

13:45.333 --> 13:48.154
Now I got a lot of ground to
make up to catch Rainbow.

13:48.155 --> 13:49.881
Just be careful!

13:59.185 --> 14:01.202
See you at the finish line!

14:01.448 --> 14:03.347
I don't believe it!

14:03.348 --> 14:07.019
After a huge setback, Applejack is
back at the front of the pack.

14:07.020 --> 14:11.528
She's the head of the pack, all right.
The pick of the litter! The CAT'S PYJAMAS!

14:11.785 --> 14:16.838
Oh, wait! Why would Applejack take some poor
kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her.

14:17.085 --> 14:20.222
Oookay... Let's get back to the race.

14:21.173 --> 14:24.725
Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet.

14:24.726 --> 14:26.157
It is for you.

14:36.867 --> 14:39.943
I don't believe it! Applejack tripped me.

14:40.043 --> 14:41.884
Don't you ponies ever look where you're going?

14:41.885 --> 14:44.211
You tripped on a stump. See?

14:44.212 --> 14:47.281
Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see.

14:47.282 --> 14:50.889
Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat.
It was just an accident.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.335
Sure it was.

14:53.531 --> 14:56.271
I mean... Yeah! I'm sure it was.

14:56.272 --> 14:58.880
Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game.

14:59.097 --> 15:02.131
Yes. But the rules have changed.

15:02.132 --> 15:04.630
And two can play at that game.

15:08.243 --> 15:11.231
Welcome back, Ponyvillians! It's me, Pinkie Pie.

15:11.232 --> 15:12.344
And Spike.

15:12.444 --> 15:15.322
Looks like Rainbow's doing her best to catch up.

15:15.323 --> 15:17.955
I'm not sure how ketchup is
going to help her in this contest.

15:17.956 --> 15:21.458
Now, in a hot dog eating contest it
can make them doggies nice and slippery.

15:21.459 --> 15:23.819
But personally, I prefer mustard.
How about you, Spike?

15:24.117 --> 15:26.858
Uh... I like... pickles?

15:26.925 --> 15:32.206
Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself
in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.

15:33.137 --> 15:35.357
Look, ma! No wings!

15:36.016 --> 15:40.660
As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail
Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead.

15:47.582 --> 15:49.616
Hey! Rainbow!

15:51.705 --> 15:54.540
Why, that little cheater did that on purpose!

15:55.176 --> 15:57.112
It's on!

15:59.587 --> 16:00.720
Nice one, Rainbow.

16:00.721 --> 16:01.523
...Later!...

16:45.293 --> 16:48.784
Oh my! Whitetail Wood is just lovely.

16:50.292 --> 16:52.744
Hey, Rainbow! Shouldn't you be up ahead?

16:54.001 --> 16:55.625
I'm sure I'll win now.

16:55.626 --> 16:58.426
Except that all the other racers just passed you.

16:58.530 --> 17:00.776
Oh horse apples...! See ya!

17:04.437 --> 17:06.860
Applejack! What are you doing up here?

17:06.861 --> 17:08.419
There aren't even any trees.

17:08.619 --> 17:11.093
Uh, no, but the sign's pointed this way...

17:11.802 --> 17:13.187
Rainbow!

17:13.188 --> 17:14.584
Mind giving me a lift?

17:19.220 --> 17:21.496
What a hay?! You said no flying!

17:21.497 --> 17:23.683
No. I said no wings.

17:24.740 --> 17:26.668
I must say, Spike, that this has been...

17:26.669 --> 17:30.200
...the most interesting Running
of the Leaves in Equestria history!

17:30.201 --> 17:32.679
With the most interesting announcing...

17:36.611 --> 17:39.038
But it isn't the running that's been fascinating.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.720
It's the lack of running!

18:23.251 --> 18:25.869
Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete...

18:25.870 --> 18:29.218
...but shouldn't the Running of
the Leaves actually involve running?

18:29.877 --> 18:32.077
You know, I think Twilight's right.

18:32.449 --> 18:33.312
You do?

18:33.313 --> 18:36.521
Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better...

18:36.768 --> 18:38.186
RUUUN!

18:40.673 --> 18:44.564
Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are
neck and neck, jockeying for position.

18:44.565 --> 18:47.115
Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow...

18:47.116 --> 18:50.283
...it's Applejack, it's
Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack!

18:55.578 --> 18:57.089
Oh no, she di'int!

18:58.293 --> 19:00.024
Oh yes, she di'id!

19:01.412 --> 19:02.328
Cut it out!

19:02.331 --> 19:03.702
No, you cut it out!

19:03.703 --> 19:05.294
You started it!

19:05.605 --> 19:08.270
And now I'm gonna finish it.

19:08.726 --> 19:10.360
Oh no, you won't!

19:12.419 --> 19:14.371
Oh yes, I will!

19:20.444 --> 19:23.167
That's it! All bets are off.

19:23.977 --> 19:26.186
Oh no, you don't!

19:31.468 --> 19:35.911
It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash,
it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash!

19:39.850 --> 19:41.270
I won!

19:41.596 --> 19:43.579
No! I won!

19:43.580 --> 19:44.501
I won!

19:44.502 --> 19:45.902
You tied!

19:46.182 --> 19:47.300
Tied?!

19:47.301 --> 19:48.288
For first?

19:48.389 --> 19:49.713
For last!

19:49.714 --> 19:50.949
LAST?!

19:50.950 --> 19:52.568
Then who won?

19:54.189 --> 19:55.451
YOU?!

19:56.600 --> 19:58.973
Oh, no. But I did get fifth place.

19:58.974 --> 20:01.745
Which is rather good, considering
I've never run a race before.

20:01.746 --> 20:04.175
What?! How's that even possible?

20:04.475 --> 20:07.848
You ran so slow. And looked at the scenery.

20:07.849 --> 20:11.433
Exactly! I paced myself, just like my book said.

20:11.434 --> 20:14.029
Then at the end, when all
the other ponies were worn out...

20:14.806 --> 20:16.461
...I sprinted to the finish.

20:16.561 --> 20:21.011
I don't believe it. Twilight beat us!

20:21.235 --> 20:24.429
Well, with all your horsing
around, it was quite easy.

20:25.532 --> 20:29.209
You're right, Twilight.
Our behavior was just terrible.

20:29.921 --> 20:31.946
We weren't very good sports.

20:32.046 --> 20:34.893
Sounds to me like an important
lesson was learned.

20:35.022 --> 20:37.014
PRINCESS CELESTIA?!

20:37.176 --> 20:39.342
Wh... What are you doin' here?

20:39.584 --> 20:41.514
Fall is one of my favorite seasons.

20:41.515 --> 20:43.947
So I came to celebrate
the Running of the Leaves.

20:44.363 --> 20:47.615
I'm sorry you had to see us being
such poor sport, Princess.

20:47.925 --> 20:49.411
That's all right, Applejack.

20:49.611 --> 20:52.960
Anypony can get swept up in the
excitement of competition.

20:52.961 --> 20:57.893
It's important to remember that the friendship
is always more important than the competition.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.033
Exactly, Twilight.

21:00.369 --> 21:03.638
Now, unfortunately, because the two
of you were busy tricking each other...

21:03.639 --> 21:08.649
...instead of shaking down leaves, many of
the lovely trees in Equestria are still covered.

21:08.778 --> 21:12.634
Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those
leaves down for you lickety split.

21:12.734 --> 21:15.808
Whaddya say, friend?
Wanna go for another run?

21:16.153 --> 21:18.592
I'd love to stretch my legs!

21:30.374 --> 21:33.874
