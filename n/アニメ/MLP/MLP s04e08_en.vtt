WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:07.439
<i>There you are, Rarity.</i>

00:07.440 --> 00:09.055
That's the last of your bags.

00:09.399 --> 00:12.187
Actually Spike, I've got one
last pile of bags over there.

00:14.647 --> 00:17.149
Won't you be a dear?

00:18.151 --> 00:21.186
Sure. I'll be a dear.

00:22.602 --> 00:25.728
An entire week in the
fabulous city of Manehattan,

00:26.074 --> 00:29.059
plus all of my very best
friends there with me!

00:29.274 --> 00:30.813
Of course, we'd
all come along

00:30.825 --> 00:32.682
to support you during
Fashion Week, Rarity.

00:32.753 --> 00:33.994
Not that you'll
need it.

00:34.009 --> 00:35.467
We're sure
you'll win.

00:35.615 --> 00:38.392
Ooh, I can't begin to
tell you how excited I am

00:38.403 --> 00:42.310
that you'll all
be there with me. However,

00:42.411 --> 00:45.194
perhaps
I can show you...

00:46.713 --> 00:47.446
What's that?

00:47.998 --> 00:50.360
Oh, oh, oh, I know!
A paper fan!

00:50.741 --> 00:51.592
No.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.661
a magic trick!

00:52.897 --> 00:55.166
You know, where I pick a card
and remember what it is

00:55.168 --> 00:57.047
and then put it back in the deck
so you can't look at it and--

00:57.051 --> 01:01.239
These are tickets to the
hottest musical on Bridleway.

01:01.660 --> 01:04.003
You couldn't mean
Hinny Of The Hills,

01:04.175 --> 01:06.462
because that show's been
sold out for months...

01:06.830 --> 01:07.802
or could you?

01:08.081 --> 01:09.510
I could. I do.

01:10.175 --> 01:11.826
Oh Rarity, you didn't
have to do that.

01:11.834 --> 01:13.492
But since you did...

01:16.645 --> 01:17.783
This trip is fun already!

01:17.791 --> 01:19.480
I love jumping up and down!

01:19.486 --> 01:20.095
Wheee!

01:24.154 --> 01:29.857
Subtitles by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu

02:08.540 --> 02:09.836
<i>Come along, ponies.</i>

02:09.845 --> 02:12.782
I found us a place to stay only
a block from the train station,

02:12.790 --> 02:15.553
in the very heart of
this glorious metropolis!

02:19.301 --> 02:20.161
<i>Hey, look!</i>

02:20.357 --> 02:22.481
There's the theater where
Hinny Of the Hills is playing!

02:22.550 --> 02:24.409
<i>Cool!</i>

02:24.866 --> 02:25.685
<i>Wow, Rarity.</i>

02:25.834 --> 02:28.173
<i>How'd you manage to get us</i>
<i>seats for tomorrow night?</i>

02:28.374 --> 02:30.294
I gave some designs to
the costume designer,

02:30.462 --> 02:32.401
so he pulled a few strings.

02:32.415 --> 02:33.765
Cool!

02:33.779 --> 02:37.239
That is makes Manehattan
<i>so splendid and amazing.</i>

02:37.607 --> 02:39.520
<i>You do something</i>
<i>nice for somepony,</i>

02:39.537 --> 02:42.560
and you never know when they'll
<i>do something nice for you.</i>

02:42.657 --> 02:44.839
<i>So then you can</i>
<i>do something nice for us.</i>

02:45.006 --> 02:47.566
Like get us in to see
Hinny Of The Hills.

02:47.572 --> 02:51.186
Which is only the best
musical in all of Equestria!

02:51.523 --> 02:53.598
It must be good if Rainbow
Dash is impressed.

02:53.890 --> 02:56.089
Normally, she doesn't
even <i> like</i> musicals.

02:56.425 --> 02:57.118
I know.

02:57.496 --> 03:00.107
Ponies just bursting into
song in random places

03:00.111 --> 03:02.493
at the drop of a hat.

05:26.591 --> 05:28.528
To think my dresses
could soon be displayed

05:28.532 --> 05:30.386
on the most glamorous
shopping thoroughfare

05:30.390 --> 05:32.626
of the most glamorous
city in Equestria.

05:33.092 --> 05:36.280
Oh! It would be my
dream come true.

05:36.554 --> 05:38.651
Is there anything left to
do we can help you with?

05:38.856 --> 05:40.382
Hm. Nothing I can think of.

05:40.661 --> 05:42.464
The dresses are all
completely finished,

05:42.708 --> 05:44.876
all made from a
fabulous new fabric

05:44.883 --> 05:46.240
I've been developing
for months.

05:46.257 --> 05:50.052
Stretchy but not clingy,
shimmery but not showy.

05:50.362 --> 05:52.040
Sounds amazing.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.753
There's nothing left for me to
do but check in at the runway

05:54.760 --> 05:56.971
with my dresses by
two this afternoon.

05:57.188 --> 05:59.041
That's funny, because
that clock over there

05:59.055 --> 06:00.903
makes it seem like that's
only ten minutes from now.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.479
Oh, my ribbons and threads!

06:05.609 --> 06:07.621
And the runway ballroom is
all the way across town.

06:07.777 --> 06:12.368
If I don't get there,
I'm disqualified! Taxi!

06:12.464 --> 06:15.732
Oh no! We've got to help
her find a cab now!

06:16.039 --> 06:17.143
I'm on it.

06:17.588 --> 06:19.194
Hey buddy, is this cab taken?

06:19.543 --> 06:22.070
The line ends
back there, buddy!

06:22.294 --> 06:23.656
Huh? What?

06:23.980 --> 06:26.115
Does everypony in
this town want a cab?

06:26.279 --> 06:28.025
I'm afraid getting a
taxi at this time

06:28.037 --> 06:30.119
could prove almost
impossible.

06:30.419 --> 06:32.152
Please, won't you let
her have this taxi?

06:32.304 --> 06:34.837
She has somewhere very
important to be right away.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.148
Not likely!

06:36.189 --> 06:38.464
She can get in line
like the rest of us!

06:42.577 --> 06:43.687
Oh, it's no use.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.654
The cab drivers just
drive right past

06:45.666 --> 06:47.227
to get to the next
pony in line.

06:49.541 --> 06:51.557
New wheel works
like a charm.

06:51.568 --> 06:53.986
So now which of you nice
folks are hoppin' in?

06:55.094 --> 06:56.735
Fashion Runway Plaza
in seven minutes.

06:56.745 --> 06:57.504
Can you make it?

06:57.658 --> 06:58.476
Hang on!

06:58.760 --> 06:59.560
Ta ta!

07:00.013 --> 07:01.553
Phew! That was close.

07:04.044 --> 07:06.074
Anypony else got a
sneaking suspicion

07:06.083 --> 07:07.873
we're forgetting something?

07:08.243 --> 07:09.951
The dresses!!

07:14.792 --> 07:16.154
Good afternoon. I'm
here for Fashion Week.

07:16.844 --> 07:20.302
Everypony's gathered in front of
the runway and about to start.

07:20.548 --> 07:22.975
So you'll just have to bring
your dresses along with you

07:22.985 --> 07:24.965
and store them
backstage later.

07:25.159 --> 07:28.202
My, my dresses?! How could I
possibly forget them?

07:28.388 --> 07:29.943
Ah! Ah! Ah!

07:30.126 --> 07:32.265
I'm doomed!

07:32.784 --> 07:33.808
Got 'em right
here, ma'am.

07:33.935 --> 07:35.494
Your friends told me you
need these in a hurry

07:35.508 --> 07:37.184
so I offered to race
them over myself.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.045
"Anything for that
nice mare" I told 'em.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.538
<i>You're a life saver!</i>

07:42.737 --> 07:44.677
Whew! I made it!

07:44.827 --> 07:46.739
And with seconds to spare.

07:46.839 --> 07:47.916
Hello, everypony!

07:48.042 --> 07:49.295
Pleased to meet you all.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.948
Rarity, I presume?

07:52.784 --> 07:56.922
You must be Prim Hemline,
the host of this grand event.

07:57.674 --> 07:58.240
How do you--

07:58.251 --> 08:00.677
Miss Rarity, how is it
that all your competitors

08:00.682 --> 08:02.294
are here half an hour early,

08:02.304 --> 08:04.817
and yet you arrive
seconds before we begin?

08:05.720 --> 08:09.746
Oh, um, heh heh.
Just lucky I guess.

08:10.606 --> 08:13.531
Once we're done here, you're
to finish setting up backstage,

08:13.545 --> 08:16.152
so you'll be ready for your
run-through appointment.

08:16.507 --> 08:18.323
You'll show your
designs last.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.185
We keep to a precise schedule

08:20.197 --> 08:23.030
so let's try to be more than
a few seconds early, hmm?

08:23.672 --> 08:25.824
Tomorrow is the contest
to see which one of you

08:25.834 --> 08:29.391
gets to stay to meet top
designers all across the city.

08:29.695 --> 08:31.933
The rest of you
must go home early.

08:32.325 --> 08:33.178
So sad.

08:34.833 --> 08:35.551
Dismissed.

08:36.868 --> 08:39.414
I'm so glad you
made it, Rarity.

08:39.902 --> 08:43.211
Me too, but everything just
seems to keep working out.

08:43.461 --> 08:44.981
Don't you remember me?

08:45.393 --> 08:48.400
Suri Polomare, from the
Ponyville Knitter's League?

08:48.581 --> 08:50.909
Oh! Yes of course, of course!

08:50.915 --> 08:53.742
I thought you looked familiar
but I couldn't place it.

08:53.939 --> 08:55.557
You haven't been
back in years.

08:55.717 --> 08:59.851
Because I moved here to make it
in the big city. OK?

09:00.080 --> 09:02.721
Oh! Good for you, Suri!

09:02.807 --> 09:04.817
It's so good to see you.

09:05.176 --> 09:06.741
And now here we are...

09:06.846 --> 09:09.032
Competing.OK.

09:09.291 --> 09:10.224
Yes, yes.

09:10.232 --> 09:11.278
Well, good luck.

09:11.471 --> 09:12.663
Oh, I don't need luck.

09:12.671 --> 09:14.425
Would you like a hoof
with your things?

09:14.435 --> 09:16.530
Why thank you so much.

09:17.771 --> 09:20.208
My, your collection is gorgeous!

09:20.388 --> 09:23.680
Oh now, I'm sure your
collection is equally lovely

09:23.699 --> 09:24.745
if not more so.

09:25.172 --> 09:27.309
It's all right, but
nothing like this!

09:27.720 --> 09:29.262
Take my culottes, for example.

09:29.276 --> 09:31.520
They are simply crying out
for just the right accent

09:31.533 --> 09:33.166
but I haven't the
slightest notion where--

09:34.335 --> 09:37.869
Actually, just a touch of this
fabric could be perfect with it.

09:38.534 --> 09:41.184
Hey, would you mind terribly
if I took a swatch?

09:41.687 --> 09:42.729
Oh, not at all.

09:42.735 --> 09:44.571
Here, I have loads extra.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.314
You're sure?

09:46.355 --> 09:47.274
Positive.

09:47.447 --> 09:49.326
Well, it's been wonderful
getting caught up

09:49.330 --> 09:50.786
and I... I don't wish to be rude,

09:50.798 --> 09:52.320
but I need to finish
my preparations

09:52.331 --> 09:54.618
and I am a bit late
as it... is?

09:58.200 --> 10:00.700
Hello, I'm here
half an hour early

10:00.716 --> 10:03.678
for my run-through appointment,
just the way Prim likes.

10:03.877 --> 10:05.334
Get in line over there.

10:07.806 --> 10:10.435
Oh my, that fabric's gorgeous.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.087
Did you make that yourself?

10:12.093 --> 10:15.664
Why yes, it's...
stretchy but not clingy.

10:15.670 --> 10:17.884
<i>Shimmery but not showy.</i>

10:17.892 --> 10:20.801
<i>And the entire line is in</i>
<i>this same adorable pattern</i>

10:21.067 --> 10:23.746
<i>that works on everything from</i>
<i>skirts to tops to shoes.</i>

10:25.006 --> 10:27.828
Bravo! I've never seen
anything like it.

10:29.976 --> 10:32.571
You stole my fabric!

10:32.671 --> 10:35.479
I didn't steal it,
OK?

10:35.740 --> 10:37.533
You gave it to me, remember?

10:37.658 --> 10:39.678
I gave you the
fabric for accents,

10:39.902 --> 10:41.457
not for your whole line!

10:41.680 --> 10:43.203
And how could you possibly
make all those outfits

10:43.217 --> 10:44.362
out of it so fast?

10:44.696 --> 10:45.994
Fast! Ha!

10:46.388 --> 10:48.858
<i>Coco Pommel here took</i>
<i>practically forever.</i>

10:49.123 --> 10:51.104
<i>Nearly got me</i>
<i>completely disqualified.</i>

10:51.307 --> 10:52.844
Well, I wanted to
make sure you'd win,

10:52.856 --> 10:54.173
so I took the
extra time to--

10:54.183 --> 10:54.885
Quiet!

10:55.141 --> 10:58.392
I pay an assistant to sew and
get coffee, not talk. OK?

10:58.704 --> 11:00.597
How could this happen?

11:01.123 --> 11:02.829
Aw sweetie, don't
blame yourself.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.574
It takes some small town
fillies a while to learn

11:05.580 --> 11:08.175
it's everypony for herself
in the big city. OK?

11:10.690 --> 11:13.779
Hope you realize how fortunate
you are to have me as a mentor.

11:14.009 --> 11:15.164
Now get me some coffee!

11:17.385 --> 11:19.748
<i>Oh my gosh, what a great afternoon!</i>

11:19.750 --> 11:21.494
<i>That was almost</i>
<i>too much fun.</i>

11:21.672 --> 11:25.006
Better pace yourself, 'cause the
rest of the day is jam packed.

11:25.157 --> 11:26.667
First, there's the
salon appointment

11:26.671 --> 11:28.095
to get our manes done.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.152
Then our fancy dinner
at the Far Field Tavern.

11:30.359 --> 11:31.159
And after that?

11:31.326 --> 11:32.622
Hinny Of The Hills!

11:40.310 --> 11:42.466
Is everything OK?

11:42.647 --> 11:44.183
You got the dresses the
bellhop brought you

11:44.193 --> 11:45.375
and everything, right?

11:50.341 --> 11:52.595
But he said he brought them.

11:53.108 --> 11:55.752
<i>And then Suri stole them!</i>

11:57.137 --> 11:58.341
I let one of the
other contestants

11:58.357 --> 11:59.843
use some of my one-of-a-kind
fabric

11:59.853 --> 12:02.581
and then she turned it into a
wardrobe just like mine,

12:02.591 --> 12:05.957
only now it looks like I'm
the one copying her!

12:06.130 --> 12:10.040
My generosity has
ruined me, I tell you!

12:10.460 --> 12:11.838
Ruined!

12:12.764 --> 12:14.985
Now Rarity, whatever went wrong,

12:15.170 --> 12:16.718
we're all here to help
you get through it.

12:16.958 --> 12:18.275
No matter what it takes.

12:20.587 --> 12:22.017
Come on, Rarity, buck up.

12:22.255 --> 12:25.100
All we need is some fabric and
you'll be back in business.

12:37.266 --> 12:39.475
This new line is going
to be marvelous!

12:39.654 --> 12:41.110
Perhaps even better
than the last.

12:41.432 --> 12:43.055
It's daring! It's bold!

12:43.283 --> 12:45.231
Perhaps I still have
a chance after all!

13:07.440 --> 13:09.028
Twilight, sew these
pieces together

13:09.032 --> 13:10.398
according to that
pattern there.

13:10.575 --> 13:12.821
You said if we skipped
dinner at the Far Field Tavern,

13:12.837 --> 13:15.026
you'd order a meal for us to
eat while we keep working.

13:15.457 --> 13:17.190
Don't fret. It will
be here in an hour.

13:17.428 --> 13:18.942
That's not going to
be a problem, is it?

13:20.440 --> 13:21.219
Well...

13:21.281 --> 13:24.618
we're supposed to be watching
Hinny Of The Hills by then.

13:24.901 --> 13:26.655
Oh. I see.

13:27.127 --> 13:29.414
I go out of my way to get
you tickets for a show,

13:29.693 --> 13:31.079
and this is how you repay me?

13:31.350 --> 13:33.352
By abandoning me
in my hour of need?

13:38.097 --> 13:40.885
Fine! Go and see Hinny
Of The Hills tonight.

13:40.895 --> 13:43.225
Then tomorrow morning when you
come to see my fashion show

13:43.233 --> 13:45.543
without any fashion to show, you
can have more entertainment.

13:46.056 --> 13:49.767
"Oh, why look, there's our friend
Rarity going down in flames."

13:49.775 --> 13:51.233
"Isn't friendship magic?"

13:52.546 --> 13:53.951
Rarity, calm down.

13:54.185 --> 13:55.188
What's gotten into you?

13:55.348 --> 13:56.528
What's gotten
into YOU?

13:57.445 --> 13:59.685
Go ahead, see
your little show.

13:59.890 --> 14:01.910
Congratu-pony-lations,
fillies!

14:01.927 --> 14:03.619
Sounds like you've all
figured out already

14:03.621 --> 14:06.134
it's every pony for
herself in this town!

14:18.554 --> 14:20.823
There, that's the last of them.

14:22.372 --> 14:23.242
Finally.

14:24.579 --> 14:25.810
You're welcome.

14:27.080 --> 14:30.124
Let's have another round of
applause for Suri Polomare's

14:30.130 --> 14:31.884
amazing collection.

14:37.605 --> 14:40.481
That fabric! So original!

14:44.585 --> 14:45.787
Well, look who's here.

14:45.791 --> 14:47.742
Going to show off your
copycat collection?

14:49.075 --> 14:53.627
And now, Rarity from Ponyville
with her brand new line...

14:53.726 --> 14:57.200
and I mean brand
new: Hotel Chic.

15:17.607 --> 15:18.544
They're liking it.

15:18.915 --> 15:20.368
I think I may have
just won this thing.

15:20.591 --> 15:22.398
Oh, I can't wait to
celebrate with...

15:26.083 --> 15:26.893
my friends.

15:27.317 --> 15:28.222
They didn't come.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.887
What have I done?

15:39.715 --> 15:42.259
Rarity, they all adore you!

15:42.606 --> 15:45.389
Aren't you going to tell them
about your fabulous pieces?

15:50.932 --> 15:51.763
I have to go.

15:52.663 --> 15:54.078
Come back at once!

15:54.889 --> 15:56.491
This is unheard of!

15:59.695 --> 16:00.542
How do you do, ma'am?

16:00.552 --> 16:01.543
Contest going well?

16:01.557 --> 16:02.526
No time to talk.

16:02.532 --> 16:04.021
I have to find my friends.

16:04.161 --> 16:05.855
Oh. They're
gone already.

16:05.923 --> 16:06.905
I saw them headed
out this morning.

16:07.465 --> 16:08.813
Oh no!

16:09.118 --> 16:10.911
Back to Ponyville, I imagine.

16:11.244 --> 16:13.802
Oh! They worked so
hard on my behalf

16:13.943 --> 16:15.838
and I repaid them
with unkindness.

16:16.212 --> 16:17.656
What have I done?

16:18.333 --> 16:19.584
Oh. Here you are.

16:21.974 --> 16:24.522
But Miss, I
didn't do anything!

16:35.990 --> 16:39.264
<i>♪ Oh Manehattan,</i>
<i>what have I done? ♪</i>

16:39.843 --> 16:43.135
<i>♪ The thought of</i>
<i>Fashion Week was fun ♪</i>

16:44.294 --> 16:47.598
<i>♪ But I went way too far. </i>

16:48.442 --> 16:56.464
<i>♪ My friends gave to me</i>
<i>in ways so kind ♪</i>

16:56.809 --> 17:03.648
<i>♪ And I gave them nothing</i>
<i>but a hard time ♪</i>

17:03.978 --> 17:12.017
<i>♪ And now alone I stand</i>
<i>And now alone I stand. ♪</i>

17:18.528 --> 17:19.955
I need a moment
with Prim Hemline.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.594
I have to rush
back to Ponyville

17:21.603 --> 17:23.094
but I just wanted to
thank her first for--

17:23.102 --> 17:26.277
Uh oh oh. You best steer
clear of Prim for a while.

17:26.284 --> 17:28.720
She's pretty furious.
Isn't that right?

17:28.948 --> 17:30.788
Um...yes.

17:33.826 --> 17:34.893
There you all are!

17:35.272 --> 17:37.237
I can't believe it! I
thought you went back home.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.832
We missed the show
because we overslept.

17:40.499 --> 17:43.795
Suri told us you lost;
we're really sorry.

17:45.354 --> 17:46.290
I lost?

17:47.313 --> 17:49.151
You know what? I
don't even care.

17:49.457 --> 17:52.454
I'm just happy you're all still
here after how I treated you.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.014
Taking advantage of your
friendship the way I did.

17:55.256 --> 17:56.981
<i>How could you</i>
<i>ever see past it?</i>

17:58.115 --> 17:59.728
Yeah, you were
pretty rotten.

17:59.921 --> 18:01.180
Wow, Applejack.

18:01.393 --> 18:04.013
I know your thing is
honesty, but come on!

18:05.151 --> 18:07.436
Last night we may not have
seen you at your best,

18:07.730 --> 18:08.852
but we know you.

18:09.207 --> 18:10.899
And we would never let
one thing like that

18:10.903 --> 18:12.394
change how we
feel about you.

18:13.252 --> 18:15.395
Oh! Thank you.

18:15.738 --> 18:17.828
You really are the most
wonderful friends

18:17.832 --> 18:19.453
a pony could have.

18:20.663 --> 18:23.285
You know, I already arranged
to make it up to you

18:23.295 --> 18:24.374
this afternoon.

18:24.524 --> 18:27.358
Hope you're all available
for an exclusive performance

18:27.360 --> 18:29.012
of Hinny Of The Hills.

18:32.333 --> 18:35.047
And that is how it's done.

18:35.701 --> 18:38.054
Pretty clever how I convinced
her to stay away from Prim,

18:38.066 --> 18:38.680
wasn't it?

18:39.598 --> 18:42.517
Wouldn't have wanted her to find
out the truth, now would we?

18:45.494 --> 18:54.401
<i>♪ And I'm a dancing pony! </i>

19:02.193 --> 19:05.334
Wow, that was even
better than I imagined!

19:05.547 --> 19:07.254
I LOVED IT!

19:10.989 --> 19:13.619
Uh, I mean, it was all right.

19:16.353 --> 19:18.942
How did you ever get them to
agree to do an extra performance

19:18.954 --> 19:19.861
just for us?

19:20.165 --> 19:22.548
Remember my costume designer
friend who got me the tickets?

19:22.866 --> 19:26.641
Well, I offered to make all
the costumes for his next show.

19:26.850 --> 19:28.844
Um... Here in Manehattan?

19:29.668 --> 19:32.148
Well, um... yes.

19:32.384 --> 19:34.821
It will keep me away from
Ponyville for a while...

19:35.730 --> 19:37.555
But I so wanted
you to see this show!

19:38.003 --> 19:40.870
And working for this designer
is such a great opportunity.

19:41.217 --> 19:41.943
We know.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.789
We're happy for you, Rarity.

19:44.189 --> 19:45.947
We're just sad for us.

19:46.517 --> 19:47.793
<i>Mind if I join you?</i>

19:50.124 --> 19:52.089
Sure. Come on down.

19:57.192 --> 19:59.449
This is the First Place
Trophy for Fashion Week.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.051
With my name on it.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.433
But I thought I lost!

20:02.622 --> 20:04.267
You didn't. You won.

20:05.853 --> 20:08.593
Suri was hoping that if you
didn't claim your prize,

20:08.602 --> 20:10.308
the judges would
consider it a forfeit

20:10.312 --> 20:12.072
and first place
would go to her.

20:12.704 --> 20:16.347
So she lied to make you and
your friends go away, and...

20:16.846 --> 20:18.987
well, I lied, too.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.350
I've worked for
Suri for so long,

20:21.360 --> 20:22.932
I started to believe
that it really is

20:22.942 --> 20:25.071
every pony for
herself in this town.

20:25.642 --> 20:28.308
Until I saw how generous
you were with your friends.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.501
And how generous
they were with you.

20:30.774 --> 20:32.714
It made me start believing

20:32.913 --> 20:34.973
there was something
better for me out there.

20:35.416 --> 20:36.987
So I, I quit.

20:38.854 --> 20:41.303
I brought you something
to say thank you.

20:44.675 --> 20:47.326
I suppose you'll need a job now
that you're no longer with Suri.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.012
How would you like to
work for my friend

20:51.022 --> 20:53.361
making all the costumes
for his next show?

20:57.504 --> 20:59.469
Manehattan was simply grand.

20:59.672 --> 21:02.827
<i>It was in this magnificent</i>
<i>metropolis that I learned</i>

21:02.833 --> 21:05.324
<i>that while there are ponies</i>
<i>who will take advantage</i>

21:05.334 --> 21:06.273
<i>of your generosity,</i>

21:06.493 --> 21:08.577
<i>you should never, ever</i>
<i>let that cause you</i>

21:08.587 --> 21:10.481
<i>to abandon your</i>
<i>generous spirit.</i>

21:10.848 --> 21:13.106
<i>Nothing feels worse</i>
<i>than taking advantage</i>

21:13.116 --> 21:15.176
<i>of the giving nature</i>
<i>of your friends.</i>
