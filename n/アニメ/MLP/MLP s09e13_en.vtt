happened again?

And why there's a
giant turtle

00:11.845 --> 00:14.546

00:14.848 --> 00:17.983
Oh, dear. Mr. Tortasnap
said he was hungry,

00:18.285 --> 00:21.720
but he promised me he would
only take a few small bites!

00:22.022 --> 00:25.256
I don't think that thing
knows what "small" is.

that was FUN!

01:37.497 --> 01:39.397
No need to thank us.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.632
To be honest, we've
recently realized

01:41.734 --> 01:44.469
we like being part
of the action!

01:44.571 --> 01:47.739
Experiencing life instead
of just dreaming about it.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.942

It's not that we don't
appreciate their help.

But suddenly Celestia
and Luna seem to think

03:57.304 --> 03:59.070
we can't do anything
on our own!

03:59.172 --> 04:02.173
How are we supposed to learn
to be rulers of Equestria

04:02.275 --> 04:05.744
with them fixing every
teensy problem for us?

04:05.846 --> 04:08.046
Maybe the Princesses
changed their minds.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.881
Maybe they don't think we're
up to the responsibility

04:09.983 --> 04:12.083
of protecting
Equestria after all!

04:12.385 --> 04:14.519
Or maybe this week's
just a one-time thing

04:14.621 --> 04:15.987
that'll never
happen again.

04:17.724 --> 04:21.926
Ah! A strategy meeting! What
is the danger this time?

04:22.028 --> 04:25.163
A rampaging beast? Evil
spell? Friendship problem?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.265
We're ready to do
whatever we can.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.535
Great. But is
something wrong?

04:30.637 --> 04:33.805
It's just, you've been helping
us an awful lot and we know

04:33.907 --> 04:37.608
you have way more important
ruler-y things to do, so.....

04:38.812 --> 04:41.179
We've spent more than enough
time in the throne room.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.314
Real life is
happening out here!

04:43.416 --> 04:45.316
Wait, that's what
this is about?

04:45.418 --> 04:47.652
You're sick of
being princesses?

04:47.954 --> 04:50.889
Not exactly. Battling
the Everfree Forest

04:50.991 --> 04:52.791
alongside Starswirl
made us realize

04:52.893 --> 04:54.426
what we've missed out on.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.395
So instead of spending
the day ruling..

04:57.497 --> 04:59.230
And the night
patrolling dreams..

04:59.332 --> 05:02.300
We wanted a chance to
do the things <i>you</i> do.

05:02.502 --> 05:05.938
Save the day. Adventure with
friends! Shampoo anteaters...

05:06.640 --> 05:09.874
I'm pretty sure Fluttershy is
the only pony that does that.

05:10.176 --> 05:13.111
Well, there are <i>way</i>
more fun things to do

05:13.213 --> 05:15.180
than.. follow us around.

05:15.282 --> 05:18.249
Ooh! You should make a list of
all the stuff you never tried

05:18.351 --> 05:19.418
but always wanted to!

05:19.520 --> 05:22.286
There's a lotta little
things out there to do!

05:23.757 --> 05:26.591
What an intriguing idea!

05:26.893 --> 05:30.261
Only, it's much harder
to justify a vacation

05:30.363 --> 05:31.629
from the castle
when it's not

05:31.731 --> 05:34.566
an "emergency"
we're responding to.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.569
Don't worry. We'll cover
your palace duties!

05:38.371 --> 05:40.038
It'll be a good chance
for us to practice

05:40.140 --> 05:41.339
for when you retire.

05:41.441 --> 05:44.442
Well, if you're sure you
don't mind the extra effort.

05:44.544 --> 05:45.510
Pshh!

05:45.612 --> 05:47.045
Thank you, Twilight!

05:47.147 --> 05:49.680
What a relief to know the
Royal Swanifying Ceremony

05:49.782 --> 05:51.882
is in good hooves. Ha!

05:52.385 --> 05:53.584
The what now?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.922
"Fun Not Yet Had".

05:58.024 --> 06:00.759
Ooh! I can't wait to start
planning our time off!

06:00.861 --> 06:03.094
A chance to do
whatever we want!

06:03.196 --> 06:05.463
And you know
what that means!

06:05.565 --> 06:07.065
Adventure!
Relaxation!

06:09.302 --> 06:11.602
Well, it's just that
I.. I spend each night

06:11.704 --> 06:13.571
in everypony's
intense dreams.

06:13.673 --> 06:16.307
So I could use some
real-world downtime.

06:16.409 --> 06:20.912
Ah. I understand. But for me,
every day IS real-world.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.081
Meetings and decrees, and
meetings about decrees,

06:23.183 --> 06:27.185
and decrees about the
meetings. I crave excitement!

06:27.287 --> 06:32.557
Uh. I'm not sure how we
can both be happy. Unless...

06:33.259 --> 06:35.894
We take turns
doing what we like!

06:35.996 --> 06:37.362
Sister Trip!

06:37.564 --> 06:41.232
And I have the perfect
accessories for us to wear!

06:41.534 --> 06:42.600
Wait right here!

06:45.305 --> 06:49.240
Oh! [uncertain laugh]
We'll be...Twinsies!

06:51.011 --> 06:53.144
Just like regular
pony tourists!

06:53.546 --> 06:54.613
I knew you'd
love it!

06:54.715 --> 06:56.547
I have a few things
for us too.

07:00.887 --> 07:03.121
Sunglasses, bug
spray, ice boots,

07:03.223 --> 07:05.756
hoof sanitizer, and travel
snacks!

07:09.496 --> 07:11.829
You have to add water...
What do you think?

07:12.799 --> 07:14.966
It's perfect,
Sister.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.771
And here are instructions
of how to prepare

07:19.873 --> 07:21.940
for the Royal Swanifying.

07:22.542 --> 07:26.277
If it's written down, I'm sure
we can handle it. Have fun!

07:26.679 --> 07:28.746
One more thing. We're
leaving you in charge

07:28.848 --> 07:30.948
of raising the sun and
moon while we're gone.

07:32.936 --> 07:35.853
We have put a small part of
our power in this amulet.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.923
You can activate it with
your magic at any time.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.092
Preferably dawn and dusk.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.395
Ooh! That's not a terrifying
level of responsibility

07:44.497 --> 07:45.564
or anything.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.265
We won't let you
down, princesses.

07:54.541 --> 07:55.873
Please tell me that
scroll says what

07:55.975 --> 07:57.810
the Royal Swanifying is!?

07:59.012 --> 08:02.146
Apparently, it's a
celebration of all the swans

08:02.248 --> 08:04.548
in the royal lake.
We round 'em up,

08:04.650 --> 08:06.017
parade 'em through
the streets,

08:06.119 --> 08:08.119
and finish with a
party in the castle.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.991
One question. WHY?

08:13.293 --> 08:14.325
It doesn't matter.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.227
This is our chance to
show Celestia and Luna

08:16.329 --> 08:18.129
we'll do whatever
the job requires.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.198
If they can take care
of all this themselves,

08:20.300 --> 08:22.901
then I know we
can, together!

08:23.403 --> 08:24.869
Ah! Jolly good...

08:26.573 --> 08:29.040
You are definitely not
reading the scroll I am.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.947
Remember, sister,
from now on,

08:36.049 --> 08:38.916
we are regular,
care-free ponies.

08:40.987 --> 08:43.221
We're leaving the
princess life behind!

08:43.323 --> 08:45.491
And we're not even
going to fly!

08:46.593 --> 08:49.594
Of course! How
new and different!

Princesses, we are

11:16.776 --> 11:19.443
Er. We're fillin' in
for Their Majesties.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.212
What can we help
y'all with?

11:21.314 --> 11:25.416
I say. How irregular. Well,
then, we offer our assistance

11:25.518 --> 11:28.219
as heads of the Royal
Swanifying committee.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.555
Ah! What a relief.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.758
Thank you. But we
have it all covered!

11:34.060 --> 11:38.596
<i>Really</i>...? Well. Good
luck with that!

11:41.301 --> 11:43.367
If we ask for help,
it's just like admitting

11:43.469 --> 11:46.070
we're not as good at the job
as Luna and Celestia are!

11:46.172 --> 11:49.507
Besides, how hard can
throwing a "Swan Party" be?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.609
Yeah! All we have
left to do is...

11:51.711 --> 11:53.511
Polish the armor, bubble the
punch, glitter the carpets,

11:53.613 --> 11:54.679
puff the pastry,
float the floats,

11:54.781 --> 11:56.280
and carpet every
road in Canterlot!

11:56.782 --> 11:57.616
Should I keep reading?

11:58.418 --> 11:59.350
Ha, ha, ha!

12:00.987 --> 12:04.855
Ah, Celestia, since we're
both a little tired,

12:04.957 --> 12:07.992
maybe the first thing we
do shouldn't be.. too wild.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.928
Exactly what I
was thinking.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.864
ZIP LINE...!

12:22.909 --> 12:27.213
Now every time we have tea, we
can remember this magical day!

12:28.815 --> 12:31.282
Well, I'm glad you
enjoyed yourself.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.917
But now, we're going
to do something

12:33.019 --> 12:34.652
I've always wanted to do,

12:34.754 --> 12:36.921
but never could, because
of my night shift!

12:37.223 --> 12:38.456
Is it another zip-line!?

12:39.158 --> 12:40.024
...No.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.826
It's the post office!

12:44.263 --> 12:45.330
It is indeed.

12:46.232 --> 12:49.967
Just think! All the mail in
Ponyville goes through here!

12:50.069 --> 12:51.535
Isn't that amazing!?

12:54.707 --> 12:56.507
One stamp, please!

13:07.653 --> 13:09.720
Wait for it.....!

13:17.563 --> 13:19.097
You didn't need a stamp

13:19.199 --> 13:21.732
if you were just going
to give this to me...

13:21.834 --> 13:24.101
Yes but, <i>I</i> didn't
give it to you!

13:24.203 --> 13:26.570
A mailpony took it from me,

13:26.672 --> 13:30.875
searched to find who it was
meant for, and gave it to you!
