WEBVTT

00:03.722 --> 00:05.717
All right, ponies.
Listen up!

00:06.214 --> 00:07.235
We're all ears!

00:07.562 --> 00:08.653
Right, Bulk Biceps?

00:10.897 --> 00:12.878
Nu-uh, I'm all muscles.

00:13.978 --> 00:14.675
Yeah!

00:15.545 --> 00:17.841
I like your attitude,
Bulk Biceps,

00:17.949 --> 00:20.554
but it's gonna take more
than muscles and "yeah"s

00:20.565 --> 00:22.435
to get us to the
Equestria Games.

00:22.971 --> 00:26.487
We are the aerial relay team,
and it's up to the three of us

00:26.499 --> 00:29.223
to make sure that we
qualify at the tryouts.

00:29.574 --> 00:31.824
And do I need to remind
you how much I...

00:32.140 --> 00:35.348
I mean, Ponyville
wants to qualify

00:35.356 --> 00:36.491
and make it to the games?

00:36.856 --> 00:37.701
I remember!

00:37.713 --> 00:41.916
I really, really, really want to
qualify for you AND Ponyville!

00:42.078 --> 00:43.024
Bring it on!

00:44.048 --> 00:46.241
Gimme a "P" for Ponyville!

00:46.755 --> 00:49.153
"P" Ponyville!

00:49.910 --> 00:50.589
"P"!

00:52.144 --> 00:53.816
Oh. Thanks, Pinkie Pie!

00:54.040 --> 00:56.673
That was a scary, I
mean great, cheer.

00:57.172 --> 00:58.618
Just make sure you
have one ready

00:58.628 --> 01:00.905
for when we qualify for
the Aerial Relay.

01:01.143 --> 01:03.520
And after that, for
when we win gold medals

01:03.533 --> 01:05.246
at the Equestria Games!

01:05.387 --> 01:06.640
<i>Not so fast!</i>

01:07.114 --> 01:09.568
If yer gonna be good,
yer gonna be better

01:09.570 --> 01:11.596
with some a' my Apple
Brown Betty's in ya!

01:11.947 --> 01:13.116
They're perfect.

01:14.384 --> 01:15.510
"P" is for perfect!

01:18.191 --> 01:19.172
<i>All right, team!</i>

01:20.197 --> 01:21.761
Show me what you've got!

01:22.167 --> 01:24.027
Put some bend into those knees!

01:24.292 --> 01:25.498
Flap those wings!

01:26.257 --> 01:28.156
And I want to see all four
hooves off the ground

01:28.160 --> 01:29.338
on the count of three!

01:31.650 --> 01:32.329
One, two, three!

01:41.402 --> 01:43.453
Don't forget to breathe
while you're up there!

01:50.942 --> 01:51.916
"P" is for...

01:52.351 --> 01:54.080
uh... pain?

02:03.990 --> 02:08.245

02:43.140 --> 02:44.240
Good luck, Rainbow Dash!

02:44.830 --> 02:46.960
Sorry we couldn't fly with
you on the aerial relay,

02:46.970 --> 02:49.270
but the air sprinters
needed us, too.

02:49.690 --> 02:51.600
Too bad we can only
compete in one event.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.060
But, rules are rules!

02:55.760 --> 02:56.640
Good luck!

02:57.100 --> 02:58.800
It was nice of you to
be part of a team

02:58.810 --> 03:00.740
that doesn't have uh....

03:02.280 --> 03:03.820
the strongest flyers.

03:04.210 --> 03:05.560
Nothing nice about it!

03:05.830 --> 03:08.270
I know that I can pick
up the slack for anypony.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.310
With me on the
team, we'll qualify.

03:10.570 --> 03:11.630
I'm sure of it!

03:12.250 --> 03:14.230
Ponyville is very
lucky to have you.

03:14.510 --> 03:16.130
Yeah, I'm pretty awesome!

03:19.870 --> 03:22.560
I am so proud to be
representing Ponyville!

03:25.430 --> 03:28.050
It's such an honor to even
try out for the games.

03:28.220 --> 03:31.000
I just hope I don't
let anypony down.

03:31.180 --> 03:32.410
We'll make them proud.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.120
"P" is for PROUD!

03:34.360 --> 03:37.040
We're going to be the best
fans anypony has ever seen!

03:38.100 --> 03:40.380
Can't wait to see what
everypony else is wearing,

03:40.770 --> 03:43.330
even though I am absolutely
sure they won't be better

03:43.340 --> 03:45.060
than the Ponyville
uniforms I'm designing

03:45.070 --> 03:46.290
for the Equestria games.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.240
And we WILL make it
to the games

03:48.250 --> 03:51.190
once everypony carbo loads
on my Apple Brown Bettys.

03:51.650 --> 03:52.440
<i>I can't wait!</i>

04:30.530 --> 04:33.380
That's Rainbow Dash.
She's an awesome flyer!

04:33.680 --> 04:35.880
I heard that she's flying the
last third of the relay,

04:35.890 --> 04:37.700
which means everypony
else is gonna have to be

04:37.710 --> 04:39.250
way ahead to beat her.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.770
<i>The Wonderbolts!</i>

04:45.110 --> 04:47.360
<i>I hear they're</i>
<i>flying for Cloudsdale.</i>

04:47.570 --> 04:50.020
<i>Then Cloudsdale</i>
<i>will definitely qualify.</i>

04:50.270 --> 04:52.270
They're the best
flyers ever!

04:53.380 --> 04:55.110
<i>And the game is on!</i>

04:55.870 --> 04:58.710
Nice to see there's some
real competition here.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.480
Two more days of practice,
then we'll see you in the air,

05:01.490 --> 05:02.590
Rainbow Dash!

05:03.290 --> 05:04.310
If you're lucky!

05:07.660 --> 05:10.300
The Wonderbolts know a
winner when they see one!

05:10.610 --> 05:13.230
And we'll be winners just as
soon as we practice.

05:13.430 --> 05:14.290
Right, team?

05:14.740 --> 05:15.210
Right!

05:15.730 --> 05:16.540
YEAH!

05:16.780 --> 05:17.820
Hooray!

05:22.190 --> 05:22.990
And um...

05:23.290 --> 05:24.190
I'm with her.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.050
Hooray!

05:25.260 --> 05:26.670
Give us some Clouds!

05:26.680 --> 05:28.200
Give us some Dale!

05:28.210 --> 05:29.420
And what do you get?

05:29.890 --> 05:31.400
Cloudsdale!

05:31.490 --> 05:32.990
<i>Whooooo!</i>

05:33.630 --> 05:35.420
Where can I get pom
poms like those?

05:37.050 --> 05:40.240
So, do I need to remind you
of what our goal is here?

05:40.950 --> 05:42.150
Uh, maybe?

05:42.600 --> 05:45.960
We want to qualify. We need to
be one of the first four teams

05:45.970 --> 05:47.360
to cross the finish line.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.900
Bulk Biceps, you're
the first flyer,

05:49.910 --> 05:51.680
so let me see you flap it!

06:00.490 --> 06:01.130
What the?

06:01.630 --> 06:02.420
Sorry!

06:02.750 --> 06:04.340
Got the idea
from them, but...

06:04.820 --> 06:06.500
Hooves down, cakes up!

06:10.040 --> 06:11.830
It looks like they've
got better aim.

06:12.430 --> 06:15.900
OK, the passing of the
baton needs to be seamless.

06:17.020 --> 06:20.100
You shouldn't miss a wing beat
or drop a hair in altitude

06:20.380 --> 06:22.900
and whatever you do,
don't let go of it!

06:24.120 --> 06:26.500
Are you really, really,
really, sure you're ready?

06:26.670 --> 06:29.460
I mean, I don't want to take
it if you're not super sure.

06:30.420 --> 06:31.280
Ready!

06:38.060 --> 06:39.710
Ponyville can do
so much better!

06:40.010 --> 06:42.090
I'll be back with a freshly
painted one in no time!

06:42.270 --> 06:44.200
We were using that!

06:44.510 --> 06:47.790
And it's not like anypony else
has color-coordinated horseshoes

06:47.800 --> 06:48.680
or anything!

06:51.740 --> 06:53.450
I guess someponies do!

06:53.870 --> 06:54.990
Someponies do what?

06:56.190 --> 06:57.930
Have a better chance
of qualifying

06:57.940 --> 07:00.670
and going to the Equestria
Games than others.

07:08.140 --> 07:09.410
<i>Watch and learn.</i>

07:09.600 --> 07:11.320
The Cloudsdales are Wonderbolts

07:11.440 --> 07:14.130
and Wonderbolts are the best
fliers there are.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.400
And my personal heroes.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.540
So maybe you can
learn something.

07:23.340 --> 07:25.040
PLEASE learn something!

07:25.650 --> 07:26.710
Come on, Soarin'!

07:26.870 --> 07:28.050
Pick up the pace!

07:28.200 --> 07:29.410
You can do better than that!

07:29.750 --> 07:30.870
I sure hope so.

07:31.370 --> 07:34.860
Practice! Practice!
YAY Practice!

07:37.060 --> 07:37.870
Whoa!

07:40.160 --> 07:42.760
Help!

07:44.300 --> 07:46.360
Help!

07:50.230 --> 07:51.230
Gotcha!

07:57.320 --> 07:58.440
Awesome!

07:58.560 --> 08:00.330
As good as any Wonderbolt!

08:00.580 --> 08:03.580
Oh, Rainbow Dash, I'm
just so proud of you!

08:03.850 --> 08:05.650
You scooped Soarin'
out of the sky

08:05.800 --> 08:07.670
and brought him down to
the ground, and now?

08:07.740 --> 08:08.920
Now he's OK.

08:08.930 --> 08:10.840
At least, I hope he's OK.

08:11.230 --> 08:12.190
Are you OK?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.570
Uh, my wing hurts...

08:16.280 --> 08:19.300
But, I'm sure it'll be
OK by the competition.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.020
You're the best, Rainbow Dash!

08:29.640 --> 08:31.220
Aw, it was nothing!

08:31.540 --> 08:33.830
But if you feel like talking
about how great I am,

08:33.980 --> 08:35.240
don't let me stop you!

08:36.120 --> 08:38.190
"P" is for Rainbow Dash!

08:39.690 --> 08:41.500
Um, Rainbow Dash actually
starts with an 'R.'

08:42.820 --> 08:43.690
Never mind!

08:44.180 --> 08:46.960
Tough break to lose a teammate
right before the tryouts.

08:48.470 --> 08:49.600
You know...

08:49.740 --> 08:51.570
you grew up in Cloudsdale.

08:51.850 --> 08:54.520
So, that means you
could fly with us.

08:55.080 --> 08:55.950
Fly?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.770
We mean practice.

08:59.140 --> 09:01.350
You could practice with us
until Soarin' is better.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.810
What do you say?

09:03.170 --> 09:04.610
Want to be our third?

09:04.910 --> 09:06.900
I don't know.

09:07.150 --> 09:10.220
My team really needs me to be
at my best in order to qualify.

09:10.970 --> 09:13.950
Don't want to be too worn out by
the time the race comes around.

09:14.110 --> 09:16.430
We put you through some
pretty intense workouts

09:16.440 --> 09:19.350
at the Wonderbolt Academy and
you handled those just fine.

09:20.980 --> 09:23.630
I did kick some major
tail at the Academy.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.500
But I don't know how my
teammates will feel

09:26.510 --> 09:28.750
about me practicing
with the competition.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.710
Who says they
need to know?

09:31.120 --> 09:32.560
Think about it, Rainbow Dash;

09:32.820 --> 09:35.570
this is your chance to
fly with the winners.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.400
All right, I'll do it!

09:47.040 --> 09:49.200
Wise decision,
Rainbow Dash.

10:04.420 --> 10:05.320
Awesome!

10:06.170 --> 10:07.670
Whinny, Ponies, Whinny!

10:07.860 --> 10:10.180
Fly on! Fly on! Fly on!

10:14.910 --> 10:16.400
Come on, Bulk Biceps!

10:16.410 --> 10:17.580
You can do it!

10:20.940 --> 10:22.800
And I'm ready to
take the horseshoe...

10:23.540 --> 10:24.340
if you want me to!

10:49.210 --> 10:50.970
You, uh, keep doing
your wing-ups.

10:51.130 --> 10:53.570
I'm just gonna go get
some, uh, water.

11:41.810 --> 11:42.560
Yeah!

11:43.800 --> 11:44.670
Too much?

11:56.060 --> 11:58.800
It's not easy practicing
with two teams is it?

12:00.090 --> 12:01.180
You know?

12:01.690 --> 12:02.870
Does anypony else?

12:03.460 --> 12:05.270
No, they're too
busy practicing

12:05.280 --> 12:07.100
to wonder why you
keep disappearing.

12:07.430 --> 12:09.270
Well, I've seen the
other teams practicing,

12:09.280 --> 12:11.190
and we're still
going to qualify!

12:11.580 --> 12:14.100
I can fly fast enough
to make up the distance.

12:14.570 --> 12:17.020
It just seems like one of the
teams you're practicing with

12:17.230 --> 12:19.160
needs a little more
help than the other one.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.000
But, it's so much more fun
working out with the winners

12:22.010 --> 12:24.880
than... um, the non-winners.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.890
Besides, Ponyville
will still qualify!

12:28.200 --> 12:29.860
Rainbow Dash, you
got a minute?

12:30.880 --> 12:31.690
Uh, sure.

12:33.180 --> 12:36.000
You could really be an
asset to our team so,

12:36.620 --> 12:38.640
we want you to join
the Cloudsdale team...

12:39.170 --> 12:40.140
permanently.

12:42.460 --> 12:44.310
It looks like Soarin's
wings won't heal in time

12:44.320 --> 12:46.950
for the trials. We want
you to fly with us.

12:47.360 --> 12:51.030
Of course, this means you won't
be able to fly for Ponyville.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.120
But let's face it, even
with you on their team,

12:54.210 --> 12:57.020
<i>their chances of qualifying</i>
<i>for the Games are pretty slim.</i>

12:59.560 --> 13:01.670
So... what's it going to be?

13:02.220 --> 13:03.490
Well, I...

13:04.660 --> 13:05.850
Take some time to
think about it.

13:08.230 --> 13:10.380
They want me to fly with them!

13:10.540 --> 13:12.410
It's like a dream come true!

13:14.030 --> 13:15.440
If you fly for Cloudsdale,

13:15.640 --> 13:17.640
Pinkie Pie won't have
anypony to cheer for.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.080
Rarity's uniforms
will never be seen.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.990
And Applejack will have slaved
over those Apple Brown Bettys

13:23.000 --> 13:23.840
for nothing.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.350
But I really want to fly
with the BEST team!

13:27.810 --> 13:28.980
What would you do?

13:29.610 --> 13:31.860
I think this is a decision you
have to make on your own.

13:32.700 --> 13:35.500
The race is tomorrow, so
you better make it soon.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.470
Woe is me!

13:55.480 --> 13:57.190
What's happened?

13:59.010 --> 14:01.190
I've hurt my hoof!

14:02.980 --> 14:03.940
All of them?

14:04.790 --> 14:12.310
I, uh, tripped, on a, uh, foam
hoof, and landed on a, uh, "..."

14:12.900 --> 14:16.910
Oooh, if I get my hooves
on that "...",

14:17.110 --> 14:19.000
It'll be in big trouble!

14:19.740 --> 14:22.730
There is no way
I can fly now.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.250
Do you think you'll
be better by tryouts?

14:27.810 --> 14:31.190
I'll be lucky
if I ever fly again.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.830
I just need a little rest.

14:36.560 --> 14:40.130
Oh, don't worry, Rainbow Dash,
we'll take care of you or,

14:40.530 --> 14:45.050
at least somepony will, like a
medic or a doctor or a nurse.

14:50.270 --> 14:53.660
So the Medic Pony isn't
sure what's wrong with you.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.900
Everything! Absolutely
everything!

14:58.180 --> 14:59.500
This'll cure everything
that ails ya.

15:02.050 --> 15:02.780
Thank you.

15:03.180 --> 15:05.030
I couldn't have done
that on my own.

15:06.170 --> 15:09.170
Nothing says get better like
a little medical pizazz.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.400
Silk slings and a
glitter bandage?

15:11.820 --> 15:13.340
That might help.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.760
And how is our patient doing?

15:21.750 --> 15:23.470
I've been better.

15:23.860 --> 15:27.120
We just wanted to let you know
that we're so sorry you're hurt

15:27.440 --> 15:29.620
but you shouldn't worry a
bit about not being able

15:29.630 --> 15:30.560
to be in the tryouts.

15:30.730 --> 15:31.680
We'll be all right.

15:31.810 --> 15:33.570
We even have a replacement.

15:38.110 --> 15:40.270
We're so, so sorry
that you can't compete.

15:40.510 --> 15:43.670
We all know how much you
love to fly and we promise...

15:43.930 --> 15:45.490
Cross our hearts!

15:45.610 --> 15:48.220
... that if we qualify and make
it to the Equestria Games

15:48.230 --> 15:51.590
and all win gold medals,
you can have ours...

15:51.950 --> 15:55.080
because we know how much
a gold medal means to you.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.770
Thanks.

15:59.450 --> 16:02.170
I think Rainbow Dash might
need to rest some more...

16:02.630 --> 16:04.400
<i>Don't forget your bettys!</i>

16:05.030 --> 16:09.070
You know, choosing not to
choose isn't really a decision.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.860
You sure have nice friends.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.500
Nopony's been by to visit me.

16:17.090 --> 16:18.800
Too busy practicing, I guess.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.380
Well, hopefully your
wing will be better soon.

16:21.860 --> 16:23.020
Oh, it's fine.

16:23.230 --> 16:26.430
I'm just keeping it warm in
case my team wants me back.

16:27.180 --> 16:28.770
What do you mean,
wants you back?

16:29.080 --> 16:31.110
Spitfire and Fleetfoot told
me that you were still

16:31.120 --> 16:32.340
too injured to fly.

16:33.030 --> 16:35.150
And they told me that they
were worried I wouldn't be

16:35.160 --> 16:36.830
one hundred percent
by the tryouts,

16:37.220 --> 16:39.320
so they were going with
somepony else.

16:39.770 --> 16:41.580
That somepony else was me!

16:41.960 --> 16:45.640
Until, well, until I
got hurt, that is.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.930
So, I guess
we're all out of luck.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.100
Cloudsdale won't qualify
without three flyers and...

16:52.520 --> 16:54.800
Ponyville won't
qualify without you!

16:55.200 --> 16:56.430
Too bad.

17:12.010 --> 17:13.830
Even with Rainbow
Dash's replacement,

17:14.260 --> 17:17.190
I don't think we're going to
qualify; no offense.

17:19.110 --> 17:21.870
Agh! What am I going to do
with all of these now?

17:22.270 --> 17:24.670
Uh, What were you going to
do with them before?

17:26.380 --> 17:28.330
Maybe my Equestria
Games uniforms

17:28.340 --> 17:30.100
will still be in
style next year.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.460
I mean, I am pretty
fashion-forward!

17:37.440 --> 17:40.290
Is that Rainbow
Dash... walking?

17:46.670 --> 17:48.820
Does this mean you're
feeling better?

17:49.730 --> 17:54.230
I feel great because I was
never hurt in the first place.

17:57.940 --> 18:00.480
I faked my injury so that
I wouldn't have to choose

18:00.490 --> 18:03.270
between flying for
Ponyville or Cloudsdale.

18:03.650 --> 18:07.330
I wanted to fly with you both
and the decision was too hard.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.620
Oh, Rainbow Dash, you
don't have to choose us.

18:11.070 --> 18:12.520
I know you love to win,

18:12.790 --> 18:15.210
<i>and you should go with the</i>
<i>team that surely will!</i>

18:15.960 --> 18:17.920
I know now who I should
have been loyal to.

18:18.330 --> 18:21.070
Good choice. Always
stick with the winners.

18:21.620 --> 18:22.280
Ponyville!

18:23.870 --> 18:25.410
Because it's not
just where I live,

18:25.770 --> 18:27.160
but it's where my
friends are,

18:27.600 --> 18:29.510
the ponies who really
care about me,

18:29.660 --> 18:32.420
<i>whether I can help</i>
<i>them win a race or not.</i>

18:36.890 --> 18:39.050
Are you sure that's
the right decision?

18:39.320 --> 18:41.350
You lied to me about
Soarin's wing

18:41.360 --> 18:42.980
just so you could
get a better flyer.

18:44.420 --> 18:45.860
You may be a winning team,

18:46.220 --> 18:49.230
but you're still not the kind
of team I want to be a part of.

18:50.540 --> 18:51.390
Huh.

18:51.670 --> 18:53.820
Rainbow Dash, you are something.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.260
Saw it at the Academy.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.710
Seeing it again here.

18:58.130 --> 19:00.410
We could learn a lot from
a competitor like you.

19:01.020 --> 19:02.690
Think we already have.

19:05.540 --> 19:06.310
Ready to fly?

19:07.100 --> 19:07.890
Really?

19:08.390 --> 19:10.810
Never should have lied and tried
to replace you to begin with.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.040
Go, Cloudsdale!

19:15.330 --> 19:17.040
Come on, Ponyville Relay Team.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.470
We've got a race
to get ready for!

19:21.530 --> 19:22.340
Yeah!

19:28.840 --> 19:30.680
Come on, Ponyville!

19:30.920 --> 19:32.300
You can do it!

19:46.990 --> 19:48.490
Go Fluttershy!

19:48.690 --> 19:49.680
Whoo hoo!

19:57.050 --> 20:00.630
Qualify Ponyville!
Qualify Ponyville!

20:00.640 --> 20:01.420
Woo-hoo!

20:01.690 --> 20:03.970
Go Rainbow Dash!

20:18.190 --> 20:20.110
Ponyville qualifies!

20:57.090 --> 20:57.860
YEAH!

20:57.980 --> 20:58.880
YEAH!

21:00.220 --> 21:01.160
Woo hoo!

21:03.440 --> 21:05.890
Equestria Games, here we come!

21:09.140 --> 21:11.390
<i>I can't deny it,</i>
<i>I LOVE to win.</i>

21:12.270 --> 21:14.310
<i>But if I ever gotta</i>
<i>choose between winning</i>

21:14.410 --> 21:16.360
and being loyal to my friends...

21:16.700 --> 21:19.480
<i>I'm always gonna</i>
<i>choose my friends.</i>

21:19.950 --> 21:25.650
'Cause as much as I love
winning, I love them waaay more!
