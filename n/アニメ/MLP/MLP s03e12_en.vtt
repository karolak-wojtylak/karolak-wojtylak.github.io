WEBVTT

00:04.840 --> 00:07.220
You absolutely sure
you can do this?

00:07.370 --> 00:09.600
Of course! Wouldn't have
agreed to it if I couldn't.

00:09.750 --> 00:10.890
Piece of cake!

00:11.040 --> 00:14.480
Speaking of cake, I got a little
something I need to attend to.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.620
Yeah, like keeping an eye
on a house full of critters.

00:18.910 --> 00:21.870
Uh, yeah, that was totally
what I was talking about.

00:22.010 --> 00:25.450
Relax! Go to your welcoming
thing in the Crystal Empire.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.120
Spike's got it all under control.

00:35.010 --> 00:37.970
Hurry up, Twilight!
We can't miss our train!

00:38.110 --> 00:39.110
Tickets.

00:39.550 --> 00:41.470
Oh, this is gonna be a real treat.

00:41.610 --> 00:45.018
Princess Cadance said she'd never seen
the Crystal Ponies so excited.

00:45.590 --> 00:49.460
Of course they're excited.
They're up for the Equestria Games!

00:49.610 --> 00:53.040
It's only the biggest sporting
event in all of Equestria.

00:53.190 --> 00:55.890
Didn't Cloudsdale host
the Equestria Games one year?

00:56.040 --> 00:59.800
No. Cloudsdale should have
hosted the games one year.

00:59.950 --> 01:03.060
I'll never forget
when we got the bad news.

01:05.670 --> 01:09.040
The Equestria Games go to...

01:09.190 --> 01:12.250
the city of Fillydelphia.

01:12.410 --> 01:15.840
NOOOOOOO!

01:17.950 --> 01:21.510
These Crystal Ponies lost a thousand
years to an evil King's curse.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.040
They've had enough bad news.

01:23.190 --> 01:26.760
No way we're letting them experience
the pain of losing out on these games.

01:26.910 --> 01:27.940
Exactly.

01:28.090 --> 01:29.860
Princess Cadance is counting on us

01:30.010 --> 01:31.940
to do our part to convince
the Games Inspector

01:32.090 --> 01:33.490
to choose the Crystal Empire.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.560
And we are not gonna
let her down. Are we?

01:37.150 --> 01:41.000
NOOOOOOO!

01:41.610 --> 01:44.760
What? I was just answering
Twilight's question.

01:47.680 --> 01:52.680

02:23.880 --> 02:27.680
Four, three, two, one,
the Crystal Empire, that's the one!

02:27.830 --> 02:31.570
Okay, everypony, great job!
Sounds like we're ready.

02:35.170 --> 02:37.130
One more time, from the top.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.210
Oh, please.
I think that was perfect.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.380
Well, we've run this like
twelve times already.

02:42.520 --> 02:43.650
I think we got it.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.240
Cadance said the Games Inspector

02:45.390 --> 02:47.520
really puts folks through
the wringer on her visits.

02:47.670 --> 02:49.470
There's no margin for error here.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.770
And this time we need
to practice the steps.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.470
On a train car?

02:54.090 --> 02:56.520
You heard the pony!
On your hooves!

02:57.280 --> 02:59.420
Two, four, six, eight--

03:03.080 --> 03:06.770
Crystal Empire, ladies!
Watch your step leaving the train!

03:09.240 --> 03:12.830
Probably should've watched our step
while we were still on it, too.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.380
The Crystal Empire
looks crystallier than ever!

03:27.010 --> 03:30.680
They must have every pony
in the Empire out sprucing it up!

03:31.860 --> 03:34.770
This must be why we are asked to handle
the welcome committee routine.

03:35.250 --> 03:38.730
And it's probably also because
we'll be awesome at it!

03:39.120 --> 03:40.920
Princess Cadance was right.

03:41.070 --> 03:43.420
These ponies
do look pretty darn excited.

03:43.570 --> 03:45.770
Yup, I remember that feeling.

03:46.670 --> 03:48.420
But not as much as I remember

03:48.570 --> 03:52.160
the crushing wave of disappointment
that came when things didn't work out.

03:52.770 --> 03:53.800
That right there!

03:53.950 --> 03:57.130
That is the face
I do not want to see.

04:05.850 --> 04:07.260
We're here.

04:07.410 --> 04:09.160
There are my girls!

04:09.470 --> 04:12.220
Sunshine, sunshine,
ladybugs awake!

04:12.370 --> 04:15.010
Clap your hooves
and do a little shake!

04:16.080 --> 04:18.530
Oh, my.
This is spectacular.

04:18.710 --> 04:21.720
Please, everypony, stand back!
I need air!

04:21.870 --> 04:23.770
Go ahead and try whatever you like.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.320
It's all complimentary
for the welcome committee.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.220
That over there
is a crystal mud bath,

04:29.370 --> 04:32.350
which relaxes your body
and rejuvenates your coat.

04:32.500 --> 04:36.340
Now, I realize it can be kind
of strange to climb into mud,

04:36.500 --> 04:38.740
but if you'll just give it a chance,
I'm sure--

04:39.170 --> 04:40.210
Pinkie, no!

04:42.470 --> 04:45.090
Ah, so relaxing!

04:45.240 --> 04:47.260
Pinkie Pie, honestly.

04:54.600 --> 04:59.560
Go ahead, have a good time while
I get my ceremonial headdress done.

04:59.710 --> 05:02.190
Ceremonial... headdress?

05:02.340 --> 05:03.990
When meeting
with important guests,

05:04.140 --> 05:06.370
it was tradition for
rulers of the Crystal Empire

05:06.520 --> 05:09.850
to weave crystals into their manes
in a very specific way.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.870
The Games Inspector is known
for doing her homework.

05:13.020 --> 05:16.490
She'll certainly be expecting my look
to reflect the importance of her visit.

05:17.720 --> 05:18.720
Princess.

05:19.620 --> 05:23.570
If I may have a word,
I have two pieces of news for you.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.520
First, your mane stylist has the flu
and won't be able to make it

05:26.670 --> 05:28.630
for fear of you catching it, too.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.940
Well...

05:31.090 --> 05:32.710
I hope she's better soon.

05:32.860 --> 05:34.820
Do any of the other
stylists here know

05:34.970 --> 05:37.570
how to do the traditional
royal ceremonial headdress?

05:42.120 --> 05:44.320
Just a small detail.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.710
You're trying to land
the Equestria Games here!

05:49.860 --> 05:52.080
There is no such thing
as a small detail!

05:52.230 --> 05:53.410
Rainbow Dash!

05:53.570 --> 05:56.170
I suppose...
I could give it a shot.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.850
Oh Rarity,
you would do that for me?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.680
Way to step it up, Rare!

06:00.830 --> 06:04.620
Fortunately, I have all
the precise instructions right here.

06:08.230 --> 06:09.370
Oh my.

06:10.330 --> 06:12.090
You sure you're up to this?

06:12.240 --> 06:14.720
Working on the hair of royalty
on such an auspicious occasion

06:14.870 --> 06:16.780
is the opportunity of a lifetime!

06:16.930 --> 06:18.470
I will give it
everything I've got!

06:18.620 --> 06:20.920
See? No worries!

06:21.070 --> 06:24.610
Besides, the Games Inspector
isn't expected for several hours.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.670
I'll have plenty of time to figure out
exactly how to... do... this...

06:28.820 --> 06:31.000
Oh, Rarity, that's wonderful!

06:31.150 --> 06:33.500
You said
you had a second bit of news?

06:33.650 --> 06:35.020
Yes, quite.

06:35.170 --> 06:39.960
The Games Inspector, Ms. Harshwhinny,
will be arriving on the... next train.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.540
What!? You couldn't have
told us that news first!?

06:44.690 --> 06:46.500
That's fifteen minutes from now!

06:50.600 --> 06:52.540
How long before Cadance is ready?

06:53.940 --> 06:55.790
I'm sure to find some shortcuts.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.990
Can you have her back at the castle
when we're done?

06:58.140 --> 06:58.650
Done!

06:58.930 --> 07:00.650
Okay, we'll be fine.

07:01.040 --> 07:05.070
Everypony, just look out for the pony
with the flower print luggage.

07:05.220 --> 07:08.070
Easy peasy, pudding in the freezy!

07:08.220 --> 07:10.740
We'll bring the Games Inspector
back to the castle,

07:10.890 --> 07:13.550
put on our big welcome committee
how-do-you-do and then...

07:13.710 --> 07:16.570
Put the pudding out to thaw before
you eat it or you'll crack a tooth?

07:16.860 --> 07:18.520
I'll just ignore that.

07:18.670 --> 07:21.950
We need to remember that
the Games Inspector arriving early

07:22.100 --> 07:24.820
is probably part of a plan
to psyche us out.

07:24.970 --> 07:25.820
What do you mean?

07:25.970 --> 07:29.040
You said it yourself, she's got a rep
for catching hosts off-guard.

07:29.190 --> 07:31.520
Just to see if we can handle
the kind of massive pressure

07:31.670 --> 07:33.770
that comes with hosting
the Equestria Games!

07:34.080 --> 07:36.600
Oh, no...
We're gonna blow it...

07:36.750 --> 07:41.110
Not if we always stay one step ahead
and don't fall for any of her mind games.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.820
Anything she throws at us,

07:42.970 --> 07:45.870
we just needs to remember
she's testing us and roll with it.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.880
Excuse me, ma'am?

07:59.220 --> 08:00.550
Yes, what is it?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.050
- Oh, no!
- Be cool.

08:03.210 --> 08:05.150
Well, I know you're not expecting us,

08:05.300 --> 08:08.760
but we're here to personally
welcome you to the Crystal Empire.

08:10.850 --> 08:13.270
The whole lot of you
came to do that?

08:14.050 --> 08:16.840
Uh, well, um, yes!

08:16.990 --> 08:21.010
Well, darn tootin',
ain't that the cat's meow!

08:21.160 --> 08:22.620
Y'all didn't need to do that.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.440
Why, I hardly expected
anything like this.

08:26.210 --> 08:28.790
The Princess wouldn't have had it
any other way.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.610
The Princess? Princess Cadance?

08:31.760 --> 08:32.620
None other!

08:33.090 --> 08:38.230
Well, tie me up and throw me down,
this just keeps gettin' better and better!

08:38.370 --> 08:41.500
- Can we help you with your bags?
- Don't mind if you do!

08:41.650 --> 08:43.680
Ooh, I love flower print!

08:44.730 --> 08:45.570
Sorry.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.660
Our first stop is the castle,

08:49.810 --> 08:53.560
where we got a razzamatazzy
welcome planned for you!

08:53.710 --> 08:56.360
The castle? Are you kidding?

08:56.520 --> 08:58.420
Hot-diggety-dawg!

08:58.570 --> 09:00.460
See that?
We just gotta roll with it

09:00.610 --> 09:03.540
until the Princess gets there
and we'll be just fine.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.740
So, uh... how's it going so far?

09:18.230 --> 09:22.570
Oh, I'm so sorry...
It's just... so complicated.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.760
- I can fix it!
- Fix what?

09:26.910 --> 09:31.980
Well, I was looking for shortcuts
and I thought step twelve was optional!

09:32.140 --> 09:33.850
But it's not!

09:41.190 --> 09:44.470
My golly, the crystal castle!

09:44.620 --> 09:49.470
I've seen pictures but I never expected
to see it with my very own eyes!

09:52.010 --> 09:54.520
From the inside...

09:54.980 --> 09:57.860
Oh my gosh, she's so nice!

09:58.010 --> 10:00.420
You're letting her lull you
into a false sense of confidence.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.820
Watch that.
It's all part of the game.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.180
Oh my, I'm so excited.

10:07.330 --> 10:09.070
Please, have a seat, won't you?

10:09.220 --> 10:11.810
Mind if I take
a quick run outside first?

10:11.960 --> 10:16.040
It was an awfully long train ride
and my legs could use a stretch.

10:16.190 --> 10:19.110
Oh, well...
We were just about to start.

10:19.260 --> 10:22.810
Oh! Never you mind.
You go on ahead. I'm listening.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.640
She was probably testing us to see

10:24.800 --> 10:28.100
if we could remain in control
of a complex situation.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.100
Looks like we passed.

10:32.690 --> 10:34.910
We'd like to thank you
for this opportunity

10:35.060 --> 10:37.880
to introduce you
to this wonderful kingdom!

10:38.030 --> 10:40.180
Oh, well, the pleasure is all mine.

10:40.330 --> 10:42.780
And since we're not even
from here ourselves,

10:42.930 --> 10:47.240
who better than us to let you know
just how welcoming this place can be!

10:47.820 --> 10:51.540
Two, four, six, eight!
Name a place that's really great!

10:51.690 --> 10:54.740
One, two, three, four!
Keeps you coming back for more!

10:54.900 --> 10:58.460
Two, seven, nine, three!
The place that we all wanna be!

10:58.610 --> 11:01.790
Four, three, two, one!
The Crystal Empire, that's the one!

11:09.550 --> 11:12.830
I tell ya!
I have travelled far and wide,

11:12.980 --> 11:15.800
but I have never ever
been welcomed anyplace

11:15.960 --> 11:18.400
in the fashion y'all have
done here today.

11:18.550 --> 11:20.120
That's fantastic!

11:20.270 --> 11:23.090
Princess Cadance
will be so glad to hear that!

11:23.240 --> 11:26.700
Honestly, I'm surprised
she knows anything about me at all!

11:27.760 --> 11:29.180
Of course she does!

11:29.330 --> 11:31.580
She's been looking forward
to your visit for weeks!

11:31.730 --> 11:34.360
Oh, goody! Is she here?

11:35.370 --> 11:37.030
Where the heck is she, anyway?

11:37.180 --> 11:39.100
Wasn't she supposed
to be here by now?

11:39.540 --> 11:41.370
Oh, that's alright.

11:43.390 --> 11:46.710
Maybe-- I'll just take
my little run outside now.

11:49.310 --> 11:53.290
Or, if you like, we could
give you a tour of the castle!

11:53.960 --> 11:58.290
That way you could be learning
and stretching all at the same time!

11:59.340 --> 12:03.130
A tour of the crystal castle...
I'd love that a whole heap.

12:03.280 --> 12:06.030
Dash! We've hardly
ever even been here before!

12:06.180 --> 12:10.470
It's just another test!
We gotta roll with it, remember?

12:11.300 --> 12:14.630
Lemme give the tour!
I'lldoit, I'lldoit, letmeletmeletme!

12:15.660 --> 12:16.450
Fine.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.950
You all start giving her the tour
and I'll go see what's keeping Cadance.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.360
- Hello there!
- Hello yourself.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.600
First hello of the day--

12:37.710 --> 12:39.750
Wha-What are you doing here?

12:39.910 --> 12:41.310
We finished
the welcome committee song

12:41.460 --> 12:43.360
and we just wanted to introduce
Ms. Harshwhinny to--

12:43.360 --> 12:44.380
No, no!

12:44.530 --> 12:48.180
Princess Cadance isn't ready.
Something's gone terribly wrong!

12:48.330 --> 12:51.200
- I need to speak to the Princess.
- You can't! You musn't!

12:51.350 --> 12:52.780
She's in the middle of
a delicate conditioning rinse

12:52.930 --> 12:55.400
that must go perfectly
if there's to be any hope for her hair!

12:55.550 --> 12:58.060
Come on, how bad can it be?

12:58.210 --> 13:01.160
Imagine her mane
turned into a porcupine.

13:02.260 --> 13:04.950
Please, I will bring her back
from the brink of tragedy,

13:05.100 --> 13:06.710
but you have got
to buy me some time!

13:06.860 --> 13:08.800
There's no other way!

13:08.950 --> 13:13.420
So, you see this here?
This, um, this is, um...

13:13.560 --> 13:15.710
a big, round room.

13:15.860 --> 13:19.070
It's known for its roundness.
And bigness.

13:19.220 --> 13:22.710
And did I mention that it's... round?

13:22.860 --> 13:24.930
I think they call it a rotunda?

13:25.080 --> 13:28.050
A small, confining, rotunda...

13:28.640 --> 13:31.450
Whatever.
Round is round, am I right?

13:31.600 --> 13:33.860
Easy, Pinkie,
let's play this safe!

13:34.010 --> 13:37.160
We got her in a good mood,
so let's not do anything to ruin that.

13:37.310 --> 13:40.690
You know...
I love this sort of architecture,

13:40.840 --> 13:43.920
I detect a neo-gothic
inspiration in the design, yes?

13:46.210 --> 13:48.040
Hey! Look at me!

13:53.920 --> 13:55.430
And not a moment too soon.

13:55.580 --> 13:57.510
Where's Cadance?
Please tell me she's right behind you.

13:57.660 --> 13:59.730
There's a bit of a problem
with her headdress.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.000
How's it going here?

14:03.830 --> 14:06.360
I, uh, hate to be a bother,

14:06.510 --> 14:09.440
but the legs are cramping up on me
with all this standing around...

14:10.190 --> 14:11.820
She's getting bored.

14:11.970 --> 14:13.910
And we have
to buy Rarity some more time.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.160
I'll see
if Shining Armor can come help.

14:18.310 --> 14:21.310
Can't one of you other ponies
take over in the meantime?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.440
I got this.

14:23.590 --> 14:25.360
Wanna stretch your legs, huh?

14:25.510 --> 14:28.240
Well, whatever you need,
I'm sure we can provide.

14:28.390 --> 14:30.700
Let's just make our way
to the castle's gymnasium.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.030
Our tour will now be headed...

14:36.930 --> 14:38.380
this way.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.710
And we're walking,
and we're walking...

14:51.960 --> 14:53.210
Twily!

14:53.310 --> 14:54.740
Hello there!

14:54.900 --> 14:57.130
Shining Armor,
you've gotta help me.

14:58.870 --> 14:59.910
Everything okay?

15:00.060 --> 15:02.360
I left the other ponies behind
giving the Games Inspector

15:02.510 --> 15:04.290
the worst castle tour ever.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.780
Come on, gang!

15:05.930 --> 15:08.490
Are we gonna gallop,
or are we gonna trot!?

15:08.640 --> 15:09.930
Castle tour, huh?

15:10.080 --> 15:11.880
I'm pretty sure
I can give you a hoof with that.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.230
Let's move, move, move!

15:14.380 --> 15:15.740
Everything's gonna be okay.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.770
I know, I'm not worried.

15:19.260 --> 15:22.260
I'm not worried... it worked!

15:23.480 --> 15:24.800
I'm outside!

15:26.270 --> 15:28.730
Feels so good
to stretch the old legs!

15:28.880 --> 15:30.150
Uh, what the--

15:30.300 --> 15:33.220
Turns out the crystal castle
doesn't have a gymnasium.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.060
Watch it!

15:35.940 --> 15:37.530
Make her stop!

15:38.020 --> 15:41.660
Wait, that's the Games Inspector!
Let her do her thing.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.960
Oh, these hooves! I'm outside!

15:44.110 --> 15:46.940
- Why would she do that?
- I have no idea.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.010
But, that's why she's in charge
of choosing who gets the Games,

15:50.160 --> 15:51.330
and we're not.

15:56.670 --> 15:59.830
Oh, get me outside for a run!

15:59.980 --> 16:00.850
Look out!

16:01.890 --> 16:04.830
Yeah, okay, we need to stop her.

16:12.230 --> 16:15.640
Where's she going in such a hurry?

16:17.780 --> 16:20.820
Closer... closer...

16:20.970 --> 16:22.770
I think we've got her!

16:33.190 --> 16:35.800
Oh, that felt good!

16:35.960 --> 16:39.760
Nothing like a great run to shake
the cobwebs off these old bones.

16:40.470 --> 16:41.970
Hey there, speedy.

16:42.690 --> 16:46.910
Ah, these wide open spaces
y'all got here remind me of home.

16:47.060 --> 16:48.730
This is great!

16:48.880 --> 16:52.590
Oh! So you're...
enjoying your visit?

16:52.870 --> 16:55.500
Well, I'm so... glad!

16:56.070 --> 17:00.110
Oh good golly, yes, I just love
to travel and see new places.

17:00.260 --> 17:03.430
Such a beautiful spot
you got here, too!

17:03.580 --> 17:07.160
Why... thank you so much!
I'm Shining Armor.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.460
The Prince!

17:09.910 --> 17:12.110
- What's going on?
- From the looks of it,

17:12.260 --> 17:15.080
just locking up the games
for the Crystal Empire is all.

17:15.450 --> 17:17.060
Ain't no thing.

17:17.400 --> 17:21.450
My oh my...
I never met a Prince before...

17:22.600 --> 17:23.730
I'm surprised.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.480
I'd think in your line of work,
you'd meet princes all the time.

17:26.630 --> 17:27.730
Hardly.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.310
Just an ordinary
wild mustang from Mustangia

17:31.460 --> 17:33.310
here to enjoy a little vay-cay.

17:34.380 --> 17:37.510
Never thought I'd also
be meeting royalty to boot.

17:39.280 --> 17:43.850
You are Ms. Harshwhinny,
the Equestria Games Inspector,

17:43.850 --> 17:45.020
aren't you?!

17:46.320 --> 17:47.990
Inspector what-now?

17:49.140 --> 17:51.650
We got the wrong pony?!

17:52.620 --> 17:55.610
NOOOOOOOOOOO!

17:55.990 --> 17:59.170
I mean,
YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!

18:04.470 --> 18:07.830
Oh, please still be here...
oh please oh please oh please...

18:08.310 --> 18:09.790
There's got to be another pony

18:09.940 --> 18:12.430
with flower print luggage
around here somewhere...

18:13.030 --> 18:14.940
Except that there isn't!

18:15.090 --> 18:16.890
We've gotta find her
before Cadance finds out

18:17.040 --> 18:18.610
what a mess
we've made of things.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.320
Okay, here's what we do.

18:20.470 --> 18:22.680
We split the Empire up
into five sectors.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.530
Each of us search a sector.

18:24.690 --> 18:26.970
Well... Except for the spa.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.810
What's the point of checking there?
That's where Cadance is.

18:29.960 --> 18:32.650
If Ms. Harshwhinny is there,
well, then, game over, right?

18:34.200 --> 18:38.280
Every city and empire
wants to host the Equestria Games!

18:38.440 --> 18:41.550
So, I have to go through all the
big phony-baloney song and dance,

18:41.710 --> 18:44.410
though of course, I'm never
getting the real inside scoop.

18:44.560 --> 18:49.320
Oh, golly I've been having
a swell time since I got here!

18:49.470 --> 18:52.080
I'm actually thinking of extendin'
my stay.

18:52.230 --> 18:55.550
And what exactly
has made your visit so special?

18:56.550 --> 18:58.780
Gosh, where to start?

19:01.030 --> 19:02.340
There she is!

19:02.490 --> 19:03.510
We're in luck!

19:03.660 --> 19:06.390
I don't think either of them knows yet
that the other one's here!

19:09.000 --> 19:11.270
Wonderful news, look!

19:11.420 --> 19:13.350
Princess Cadance,
better than new!

19:14.120 --> 19:16.170
Princess Cadance?

19:16.320 --> 19:18.120
So, this is where you've been!

19:18.270 --> 19:19.740
I will have you know

19:19.900 --> 19:23.080
this is by far the worst welcome
I've had in all my years!

19:23.230 --> 19:25.130
I-I can't believe it...

19:25.280 --> 19:26.670
What was wrong
with your welcome?

19:26.820 --> 19:28.640
There wasn't one!

19:28.640 --> 19:30.590
What is going on?

19:32.160 --> 19:35.460
Princess, we gave our welcome
to the wrong pony.

19:36.070 --> 19:37.960
Left the right one
waiting at the station,

19:38.110 --> 19:40.930
and completely ruined everything.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.990
Cinnamon bun?

19:45.810 --> 19:47.320
When I was a little filly,

19:47.460 --> 19:51.310
I wanted so badly for Cloudsdale
to win the Equestria Games.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.530
But, it didn't happen.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.560
So I thought I could make up
for that disappointment

19:55.710 --> 19:58.820
by helping the Crystal Empire win
the chance to host the Games.

19:58.970 --> 20:02.380
But it looks like
I ruined your chances instead.

20:02.530 --> 20:03.960
Not so fast, speedy.

20:04.780 --> 20:08.660
I just finished hearing about how this pony
was just treated to the warmest,

20:08.810 --> 20:12.350
finest, most fabulous reception
she ever had.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.530
Darn tootin'!

20:13.690 --> 20:16.210
Courtesy of these fine ponies
right here.

20:16.360 --> 20:19.400
Which, in my expert opinion,
amounts to the first ever

20:19.550 --> 20:22.260
unvarnished, unrehearsed,
and unbiased appraisal

20:22.410 --> 20:25.800
of a potential host
of the Equestria Games.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.010
Which can only mean one thing...

20:28.160 --> 20:31.570
<i>The next host
of the Equestria Games is...</i>

20:31.710 --> 20:34.030
<i>the Crystal Empire!</i>

20:34.280 --> 20:35.640
We did it!

20:35.800 --> 20:38.030
<i>Congratulations, crystal ponies!</i>

20:45.060 --> 20:47.420
You know,
it feels good to help others

20:47.560 --> 20:49.760
get something you always wanted
but never had.

20:49.910 --> 20:52.360
Almost as good as getting it yourself.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.210
Almost.

20:54.360 --> 20:57.420
We'll still be able to come back here
and watch the games when they're played.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.070
You're right. That'll rock!

21:03.560 --> 21:04.840
Oh, my goodness.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.140
All aboard!

21:07.710 --> 21:09.550
Bummer Spike
had to miss out on all this.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.160
He woulda' had fun here.

21:11.310 --> 21:14.920
I'm sure he's having a great time
watching all the critters back at home.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.920
Think he's still got
a handle on things?

21:18.220 --> 21:20.360
If he's staying calm
and collected,

21:20.510 --> 21:23.320
I bet he's doing
a terrific job as a leader.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.650
You all hear that?
