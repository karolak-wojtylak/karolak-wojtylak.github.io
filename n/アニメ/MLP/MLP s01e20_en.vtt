WEBVTT

00:04.381 --> 00:06.092
So sorry, Fluttershy.

00:06.092 --> 00:08.508
I hate being late for our weekly get-together.

00:08.508 --> 00:09.622
The usual!

00:11.733 --> 00:14.989
But you will NOT BELIEVE what happened to me.

00:14.989 --> 00:16.620
Is everything all right?

00:16.620 --> 00:18.310
Oh, it's much more than all right.

00:18.310 --> 00:21.721
I was on my way here,
wearing my latest hat creation...

00:21.721 --> 00:24.213
...when who should stop me on the street?

00:24.213 --> 00:26.053
But Photo Finish!

00:26.207 --> 00:27.622
Photo Finish?

00:29.337 --> 00:32.825
She is the most famous fashion
photographer in all of Equestria.

00:35.085 --> 00:40.293
Anywho, she saw my hat and said
it was absolutely marvelous!

00:40.706 --> 00:42.467
What a lovely compliment.

00:42.949 --> 00:45.961
She was so impressed that she wants
to take some pictures of my shop...

00:45.961 --> 00:48.107
...featuring some of my clothes!

00:49.815 --> 00:51.340
That's wonderful.

00:51.797 --> 00:56.753
Do you know what this could
mean for my fashion career?

00:56.801 --> 00:59.509
Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.916
But I'm going to need somepony
fabulous to model for me.

01:03.690 --> 01:08.163
Somepony with beauty.
Somepony with grace. Somepony...

01:08.448 --> 01:09.495
...like you!

01:10.262 --> 01:12.047
Oh, goodness. I don't know.

01:12.047 --> 01:14.770
Oh, this is such a huge opportunity.

01:14.970 --> 01:17.276
And it would mean so much to me.

01:17.616 --> 01:19.082
I'm flattered, really.

01:19.182 --> 01:22.088
Nopony is going to have
your elegance and poise.

01:22.088 --> 01:23.666
-But...
-Nopony!

01:23.666 --> 01:25.817
-There has to be somepony more quali...
-Please!

01:25.817 --> 01:27.545
-Somepony more into fashion.
-Please!

01:27.545 --> 01:31.707
-Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight
-Please, please, PLEEEASE!

01:34.059 --> 01:37.779
Oh, if it's that important to you,
of course I'll do it.

01:38.186 --> 01:40.109
Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!

01:40.109 --> 01:42.680
You are the best friend a pony could ever have!

01:45.267 --> 01:48.308
What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.142
Isn't it?

01:49.142 --> 01:53.254
Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree
to model for me that I felt completely frazzled.

01:54.051 --> 01:55.706
I think I feel a pimple coming on.

01:55.706 --> 01:57.484
Oh! Only one solution!

01:58.934 --> 02:00.092
The usual!

02:38.332 --> 02:41.638
Hm... She's going to want to
see attitude and pizzazz.

02:41.947 --> 02:44.932
A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz.

02:45.305 --> 02:47.655
More light! It has to catch
the sequins just so...

02:47.655 --> 02:49.565
...or the whole outfit is just a disaster.

02:50.841 --> 02:54.510
Oh, and the headdress need more feathers.
Pinkie Pie! More feathers!

03:01.396 --> 03:03.471
And sequins! More sequins!

03:10.029 --> 03:11.290
And more ribbon!

03:12.375 --> 03:14.056
Oh no! Less ribbon.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.191
No! More ribbon.

03:20.041 --> 03:23.190
Oh, this hem is completely off.
PINCUSHION!

03:29.727 --> 03:31.536
Thank you all for helping me.

03:31.536 --> 03:35.058
I'm sorry to be so short with you,
but I'm... I'm just so nervous.

03:35.747 --> 03:37.897
Ooh, doesn't that hurt?

03:38.521 --> 03:40.535
Thick scales. Can't feel a thing.

03:40.535 --> 03:42.340
And even if I could...

03:42.440 --> 03:45.387
...there is no pain that would
keep me from assisting...

03:45.587 --> 03:49.074
...the most beautiful creature in the world.

03:50.724 --> 03:54.279
I'm gonna tell you two a secret.
But you have to promise not to tell anyone.

03:54.479 --> 03:55.598
I promise.

03:55.598 --> 03:58.676
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
Stick a cupcake in my eye.

04:06.939 --> 04:09.298
I have a crush on Rarity!

04:11.841 --> 04:13.135
We won't say a word!

04:13.135 --> 04:15.847
Give me a break. Everypony
already knows how you...

04:15.847 --> 04:18.313
Twilight! You promised Spike
you wouldn't say anything.

04:18.313 --> 04:22.575
He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust
is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!

04:23.075 --> 04:25.655
-But...
-FOREVER!

04:27.023 --> 04:28.778
My lips are sealed.

04:28.778 --> 04:31.865
Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is
gonna pick up on your feelings.

04:35.854 --> 04:37.793
I, Photo Finish...

04:38.130 --> 04:39.842
...have awwived.

04:40.557 --> 04:41.854
Let me just say...

04:41.854 --> 04:43.036
What an honor!

04:45.151 --> 04:46.329
We begin...

04:47.518 --> 04:48.392
...NOW!

04:50.059 --> 04:51.565
Attitude and pizzazz!

04:54.947 --> 04:57.790
Yes! Show Photo Finish something.

04:58.716 --> 04:59.575
No!

05:00.919 --> 05:02.028
Yeees.

05:06.001 --> 05:06.666
No!

05:07.568 --> 05:08.929
Yeees.

05:13.518 --> 05:14.125
No!

05:15.131 --> 05:16.144
Yeees.

05:18.620 --> 05:19.534
ENOUGH!

05:25.432 --> 05:27.397
She hardly took any pictures.

05:29.617 --> 05:33.057
I'm so sorry. I tried my best.

05:33.057 --> 05:36.540
Well, the headdress is too big for you
and cape had too much sparkle.

05:36.661 --> 05:39.399
I can't believe I ever thought
*I* could impress *her*.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.714
It seems that I, Photo Finish...

05:41.714 --> 05:44.360
...have found a next fashion star
here in Ponyville.

05:44.613 --> 05:45.624
Really?

05:45.714 --> 05:46.966
Yes. Really.

05:46.966 --> 05:49.256
And I, Photo Finish...

05:49.256 --> 05:53.829
...am going to help her
to shine all over Eqvestria.

05:55.601 --> 05:58.213
Tomorrow a photo shoot in ze park.

06:00.061 --> 06:00.880
I go!

06:02.822 --> 06:04.197
Did you hear that?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.315
I am going to "shine all over Equestria".

06:07.315 --> 06:10.708
Oh, Rarity. I was so worried
I'd ruined everything.

06:10.708 --> 06:13.852
Oh, never. I knew you'd be perfect.

06:28.199 --> 06:31.204
No, no, no, yes!

06:33.237 --> 06:37.125
That is definitely the one.
Photo Finish is going to love it.

06:37.225 --> 06:39.436
Everypony is going to love it!

06:39.436 --> 06:42.222
Oh, I am so excited for you.

06:42.222 --> 06:47.281
Just don't forget us little ponies when you become
the most famous designer in all of Equestria.

06:47.281 --> 06:48.468
Never.

06:48.761 --> 06:49.886
Put me down here.

06:55.884 --> 06:57.923
Oh, nonononononono.

06:57.923 --> 07:00.021
The model should be in something simple!

07:00.336 --> 07:02.398
Something inspired by...

07:03.128 --> 07:04.262
...the nature!

07:05.692 --> 07:08.021
That's just what I was thinking.

07:10.037 --> 07:13.226
Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh,
put a little something together.

07:13.246 --> 07:15.566
Yes... that will not be necessary.

07:15.566 --> 07:18.127
But... but... how are you going to help me...

07:18.312 --> 07:20.294
..."shine across Equestria"...

07:20.294 --> 07:23.056
...if I don't design something
new for these pictures?

07:23.246 --> 07:26.169
I am not going to help you
shine across Equestria.

07:26.169 --> 07:29.324
I am going to help *her* shine.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.679
She is my star.

07:31.814 --> 07:33.214
You! Go!

07:42.487 --> 07:44.270
I can't, Rarity.

07:44.270 --> 07:45.824
Oh, but you must, Fluttershy.

07:45.824 --> 07:48.317
Photo Finish wants to make you a star.

07:48.317 --> 07:50.782
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

07:50.782 --> 07:54.076
I know we were both hoping
it would be my lifetime...

07:54.076 --> 07:56.503
...but nonetheless you can't
throw away this chance.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.111
You must do this for me.

07:58.411 --> 08:01.333
You must. You must! YOU MUST!

08:01.343 --> 08:02.628
Floottershy!

08:02.728 --> 08:04.410
It is time to make...

08:04.851 --> 08:06.158
...the magics!

08:11.056 --> 08:13.023
Oh, wunderbar!

08:13.023 --> 08:14.929
You are like a delicate flower.

08:14.929 --> 08:18.036
So much more alluring without
all those sparkles und feathers.

08:24.844 --> 08:26.152
How'd it go? How'd it go?

08:26.802 --> 08:27.888
It didn't.

08:29.140 --> 08:32.192
Photo Finish wanted to work
with Fluttershy, not me.

08:32.517 --> 08:35.174
Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry.

08:35.174 --> 08:36.705
Is there anything we can do?

08:37.806 --> 08:40.543
I just vant to be alone right now.

08:42.792 --> 08:46.017
You heard her. She vants to be... alone.

08:49.775 --> 08:52.710
What? I didn't think she meant *alone* alone.

09:04.305 --> 09:05.317
Too much blush.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.074
Not enuf.

09:09.706 --> 09:10.538
Too much.

09:11.827 --> 09:12.685
Not enuf.

09:14.582 --> 09:16.202
Perfiect.

09:21.394 --> 09:25.312
Oh, yes! Even her schneezes are gressful.

09:25.567 --> 09:26.385
NOW GO!

09:28.475 --> 09:32.725
How do you feel? Excited? Overjoyed?
Frilled beyond your wildest dreams?

09:33.001 --> 09:34.769
N... nervous.

09:34.769 --> 09:36.562
Nervous? Dun be ridiculous.

09:36.562 --> 09:38.393
You're only facing a large crowd of ponies...

09:38.393 --> 09:41.131
...who will be watching your every move
and silently judging you.

09:42.591 --> 09:44.085
Your cue! Now go!

09:54.520 --> 09:56.306
You can't let Rarity down.

09:56.406 --> 10:00.635
You must do this. You must. You must. You must.

10:09.602 --> 10:12.347
-So graceful.
-So lovely.

10:12.515 --> 10:15.101
So perfect for my new advertisement.

10:51.557 --> 10:53.025
It's Fluttershy!

11:19.958 --> 11:23.119
Wow. Look how popular you are.

11:23.662 --> 11:25.575
I'm so excited for you.

11:26.055 --> 11:28.231
You must be having the best time ever.

11:29.576 --> 11:32.475
Oh, yes. Best time ever...

11:33.299 --> 11:36.040
Flootershy! I have been
looking for you everywhere.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.872
We have the thing at the place.

11:38.172 --> 11:40.738
I'll see you at the spa. Our usual time?

11:40.738 --> 11:44.645
Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the...

11:44.879 --> 11:46.222
..."thing" at the place.

11:49.893 --> 11:53.746
I'm the one who should be
mobbed by strangers wherever I go.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.566
Welcome to Carousel Boutique!

11:57.566 --> 12:00.711
Is she still here? We heard Fluttershy was here.

12:00.711 --> 12:02.574
Sorry. You just missed her.

12:02.774 --> 12:07.506
But you're still in luck. I'm having
a huge sale of some of my best designs.

12:08.723 --> 12:10.035
And you are...?

12:10.375 --> 12:11.861
Rarity, of course.

12:11.874 --> 12:13.197
Never heard of you.

12:21.022 --> 12:24.674
Obviously I, Photo Finish,
am fwilled to have found her.

12:24.918 --> 12:25.990
Photo Finish?

12:26.385 --> 12:28.809
-She's a natural in front of the camera.
-Um...

12:28.909 --> 12:30.391
Photo Finish?

12:30.445 --> 12:33.263
I only need to point
and shoot and I capture...

12:33.415 --> 12:34.538
...the magics!

12:36.516 --> 12:40.414
Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt.
It's just that I'm running late.

12:41.248 --> 12:42.772
How could I have forgotten?!

12:42.870 --> 12:44.915
Your appearance at the ballet opening!

12:44.915 --> 12:47.678
Everypony who is anypony will be there.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.822
Oh, actually I'm supposed
to be meeting my friend...

12:50.822 --> 12:51.479
WE GO!

12:56.381 --> 13:00.375
My hooves are getting positively pruney,
I've been waiting here so long.

13:02.098 --> 13:07.085
Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her
new *career* to spend time with her best friend.

13:07.138 --> 13:09.519
I'm sure she just got tied up.

13:09.519 --> 13:13.019
Of course she did.
She's a big bright shining star!

13:13.019 --> 13:15.660
I wish that star would burn out.

13:15.848 --> 13:18.541
Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.

13:18.541 --> 13:20.109
I know, I know.

13:20.109 --> 13:22.759
And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just...

13:23.003 --> 13:23.940
...jealous!

13:23.973 --> 13:26.406
Oh, please promise you won't
tell her I feel this way.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.520
Please, please, pleasepleasePLEASE!

13:29.555 --> 13:30.933
You have my word.

13:30.933 --> 13:33.801
Losing a friend's trust is
the fastest way to lose a friend.

13:33.801 --> 13:35.719
FOREVER!

13:40.854 --> 13:43.421
Wow! You look great!

13:43.635 --> 13:45.606
Fluttershy may be the one who's famous...

13:45.606 --> 13:48.634
...but that doesn't mean
I have to stop looking fabulous.

13:53.039 --> 13:55.277
Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm...

13:56.750 --> 13:59.563
Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?

14:00.020 --> 14:01.158
Sorry.

14:01.755 --> 14:03.741
Oh, I can't believe this.

14:03.741 --> 14:06.753
I am so frustrated I could just scream.

14:12.398 --> 14:13.425
Feel better?

14:14.751 --> 14:15.864
No.

14:16.867 --> 14:19.339
-Can I tell you something?
-Of course.

14:19.393 --> 14:21.552
You promise not to tell Rarity?

14:21.752 --> 14:22.822
I swear.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.076
Pinkie Pie-swear?

14:24.129 --> 14:27.486
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
Stick a cupcake in my AARGH!

14:30.814 --> 14:32.280
I don't like being a model.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.374
No, I hate being a model.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.560
All this attention is awful, just awful.

14:36.560 --> 14:41.606
And I'm only doing it because Rarity
told me I must. I must! I MUST!

14:42.911 --> 14:44.348
I must...

14:44.892 --> 14:46.558
Oh, really?

14:47.094 --> 14:48.056
Well...

14:49.419 --> 14:52.122
If you wanna know the truth, Rarity...

14:56.503 --> 14:58.079
Oh, what were you about to say?

14:58.542 --> 14:59.917
FOREVER!

15:01.389 --> 15:02.244
Nothing!

15:06.802 --> 15:07.849
I was just thinking.

15:08.049 --> 15:11.405
If you really don't like being a model,
you could always quit.

15:11.405 --> 15:14.223
Oh, no. I could never do such a thing.

15:14.223 --> 15:16.309
Rarity would be devastated.

15:16.309 --> 15:17.603
But Rarity told me...

15:28.565 --> 15:30.624
Mmm... Juicy!

15:32.325 --> 15:35.903
Oh, if only all these ponies
didn't like me so much.

15:35.903 --> 15:38.200
Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.100
She'd find somepony else with...

15:40.323 --> 15:41.496
...the magic!

15:41.535 --> 15:42.946
I guess you're right.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.357
You're right.

15:45.457 --> 15:47.185
You're right, you're fight, you're right!

15:48.418 --> 15:49.771
It's Fluttershy!

15:54.403 --> 15:58.775
Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy
could never do something unattractive.

15:58.775 --> 16:02.613
But if I used my magic to help her do something
unattractive on her next fashion show...

16:02.613 --> 16:04.835
...no one would ever want her to model again.

16:04.948 --> 16:09.332
And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model,
Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her.

16:09.332 --> 16:11.696
And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets!

16:11.696 --> 16:13.118
It's the perfect plan!

16:13.118 --> 16:14.735
You can't tell anyone about it.

16:15.220 --> 16:17.011
Promise me you won't tell anyone?

16:26.154 --> 16:29.175
S-s-so you do promise or you don't?

16:29.175 --> 16:30.549
Uh, yes!

16:30.549 --> 16:31.935
Obviously, that's why I...

16:31.935 --> 16:34.051
Zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key...

16:34.051 --> 16:36.165
...then dug a hole, then buried the key...

16:36.165 --> 16:38.209
...then built a house up top the hole
where I buried the key...

16:38.209 --> 16:39.938
...then moved into the house atop the hole.

16:40.672 --> 16:41.962
Obviously.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.277
You really think it'll work?

16:52.607 --> 16:54.157
They love you for being you.

16:54.157 --> 16:56.576
So all I have to do is make you *not* be you.

16:56.576 --> 16:57.909
Just leave it to me.

17:07.323 --> 17:09.886
Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.

17:49.412 --> 17:50.333
Oh no.

17:53.777 --> 17:55.709
Get her off the stage!

17:55.709 --> 17:58.279
She's an embarrassment to all things fashion!

17:58.279 --> 18:01.535
I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake!

18:05.413 --> 18:06.246
Bravo!

18:06.246 --> 18:07.701
I say bravo!

18:07.998 --> 18:12.451
Bravo? Who could possibly say
bravo to that horrid display?

18:12.451 --> 18:15.065
Such attitude! Such pizzazz!

18:15.065 --> 18:18.126
She's invented an entirely
new kind of modeling! Bravo!

18:18.126 --> 18:20.122
Who is saying these things?

18:20.730 --> 18:21.890
It's her.

18:21.890 --> 18:24.445
The unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress.

18:24.979 --> 18:28.803
Now that is a pony, who clearly
knows a thing or two about fashion.

18:29.554 --> 18:32.060
Well, if that fabulous pony likes it...

18:32.370 --> 18:34.860
...then I do too! Bravo!

18:47.455 --> 18:50.072
This is awful. Just awful!

18:50.072 --> 18:52.674
Somehow I've become more popular than ever.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.854
Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!

18:59.063 --> 19:02.471
If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.

19:02.898 --> 19:04.123
But Rarity...!

19:06.509 --> 19:08.249
Fluttershy! Are you all right?

19:09.109 --> 19:12.886
I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.782
Why wouldn't I be great?

19:14.782 --> 19:15.845
Because you ha...!

19:17.475 --> 19:20.597
Out there on the runway,
everyone was turning on you and...

19:20.597 --> 19:24.102
Oh... oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful.

19:24.655 --> 19:25.834
I wanted them to.

19:26.107 --> 19:27.292
You did?!

19:27.550 --> 19:29.330
Of course she did! Because...!

19:31.532 --> 19:32.572
I'm jealous!

19:32.572 --> 19:35.830
I wanted all the attention.
And instead it was going to you.

19:35.830 --> 19:39.947
I even started hoping that you would do something
silly so your modeling career would be over.

19:40.047 --> 19:44.059
But then, when it started happening,
all I could think was...

19:44.159 --> 19:47.709
...how could I want you to fail
at something you love so much?

19:47.709 --> 19:50.307
But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh!

19:52.247 --> 19:55.946
Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model.

19:55.946 --> 19:56.857
You do?

19:56.857 --> 19:58.323
More than anything.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.308
Then why did you keep doing it?

20:00.308 --> 20:04.100
I was afraid if I quit, you'd be
mad at me for not wanting to...

20:04.100 --> 20:06.233
..."shine all over Equestria".

20:06.233 --> 20:10.442
And I thought if I told you how jealous I was
of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend.

20:10.442 --> 20:11.610
Never!

20:11.610 --> 20:13.331
All this time!

20:13.331 --> 20:15.681
If we just told each other the truth.

20:15.681 --> 20:18.839
I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.

20:18.839 --> 20:19.789
Me too.

20:19.789 --> 20:23.383
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
Stick a cupcake in my eye.

20:25.269 --> 20:27.194
You were brilliant. Brilliant!

20:27.194 --> 20:30.810
I've already got six photo shoots
lined up for tomorrow aloon.

20:31.009 --> 20:35.494
I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think
I'll be able to make any of them.

20:35.494 --> 20:37.127
Wat?

20:37.127 --> 20:38.426
We go!

20:41.362 --> 20:43.502
Vat has just happened?

20:44.545 --> 20:46.321
Spike has a crush on Rarity!

20:48.591 --> 20:50.804
And you were doing so well.

20:51.571 --> 20:55.276
Now this is a wonderful way
to spend an afternoon.

20:55.476 --> 20:56.820
Isn't it, though?

20:56.988 --> 20:58.962
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:58.962 --> 21:01.927
"Being a good friend means
being able to keep a secret."

21:01.927 --> 21:05.849
"But you should never be afraid to
share your true feelings with a good friend."

21:06.410 --> 21:07.767
Did you get all that, Spike?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.705
No. I did not.

21:10.118 --> 21:13.583
I still can't believe you told someone
about my secret feelings for Rarity.

21:13.683 --> 21:17.881
You're right. That was
wrong of me and I'm very sorry.

21:18.217 --> 21:19.784
Apology accepted.

21:19.884 --> 21:22.844
Now will you take down
my letter to Princess Celestia?

21:22.844 --> 21:24.052
I would love to.

21:24.052 --> 21:27.268
But... I'm a little busy at the moment.

21:31.103 --> 21:34.603
