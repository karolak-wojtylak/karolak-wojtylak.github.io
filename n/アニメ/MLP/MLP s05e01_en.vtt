WEBVTT

00:24.420 --> 00:26.200
Let's go through
this one more time.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.920
We've been over it, like,
a million times, Twilight.

00:30.020 --> 00:32.760
We found all six
keys, defeated Tirek,

00:32.780 --> 00:34.320
and got this sweet castle.

00:34.580 --> 00:35.640
End of story.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.280
Yes, but why?

00:37.440 --> 00:38.660
I don't know, Sugarcube.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.380
Maybe it's just
your new house,

00:40.400 --> 00:41.840
and there ain't nothin'
more to it than that.

00:42.180 --> 00:45.300
I must say, speaking
strictly on aesthetics,

00:45.480 --> 00:47.400
there really doesn't
need to be more to it.

00:47.660 --> 00:50.060
It's all simply divine!

00:50.340 --> 00:51.660
I agree with Twilight.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.260
And Rarity and Applejack and
Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie.

00:55.420 --> 00:56.900
Oh. And probably Spike.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.800
As princess, I've been chosen to
spread the Magic of Friendship

01:00.820 --> 01:01.840
across Equestria.

01:02.180 --> 01:03.680
So why would the
Tree of Harmony

01:03.700 --> 01:05.560
want us to sit in a
castle in Ponyville?

01:05.720 --> 01:07.240
It doesn't make any sense.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.840
Is that new?

01:34.560 --> 01:35.720
I like it.

01:43.504 --> 02:18.528
YayPonies Subtitles.

02:18.528 --> 02:20.136
This is incredible!

02:20.368 --> 02:21.912
It's got all of Equestria!

02:22.248 --> 02:23.376
Hi, Mom and Dad!

02:46.096 --> 02:48.024
But if this is Ponyville...

02:48.192 --> 02:50.352
...why are our Cutie
Marks over there?

02:50.648 --> 02:51.512
I don't know.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.160
But it seems like the
map wants us to find out.

02:54.448 --> 02:57.688
The Tree, the chest, this
castle...and now the map.

02:58.032 --> 02:59.656
How can we not follow it?

03:00.088 --> 03:01.512
You know what?

03:01.928 --> 03:04.464
There's a ton of room
for dangerous adventure

03:04.472 --> 03:05.456
along that route.

03:05.592 --> 03:06.488
Count me in.

03:06.736 --> 03:08.928
Aw shoot, I reckon
you're right.

03:09.216 --> 03:12.624
Well, I was planning on
organizing my baking sheets,

03:12.792 --> 03:13.464
but OK!

03:13.768 --> 03:15.336
Very well.

03:18.968 --> 03:21.696
Um, maybe I'll just
stay here with Spike.

03:22.024 --> 03:22.832
Awesome!

03:23.008 --> 03:24.976
Me and Big Mac have a huge
weekend ahead of us

03:24.980 --> 03:27.504
talkin' hoofball and
trading hoofball cards

03:27.544 --> 03:29.424
and arguing about
hoofball stats!

03:29.816 --> 03:33.296
On second thought, maybe
I'd better go with them.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.016
In case they need me.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.136
Looks like it's time
for a road trip.

03:39.144 --> 03:40.632
Well? Suit yourself.

03:40.992 --> 03:42.896
But he's got a Hock
Fetlock rookie card

03:42.904 --> 03:46.168
I plan to sweet talk right
into these hot little claws.

04:23.608 --> 04:24.984
That's it! That's the
place on the map!

04:25.288 --> 04:27.656
Right! Let's get down
there and find the spa.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.992
Wait. We don't know why
the map sent us here.

04:31.256 --> 04:34.152
We shouldn't just walk right
in. It could be dangerous.

04:34.376 --> 04:35.704
Yesss!

04:36.040 --> 04:37.736
Stay behind me, everypony.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.496
I'm on it.

04:39.952 --> 04:40.864
Careful, Pinkie!

05:02.208 --> 05:04.248
This is where the map sent us?

05:04.416 --> 05:07.248
It looks like the most
boring place in Equestria!

05:07.632 --> 05:09.208
That's just
an ordinary village

05:09.224 --> 05:10.944
full of ordinary pony folk.

05:11.384 --> 05:13.640
It could certainly use
a few more architectural

05:13.664 --> 05:17.112
flourishes...or any
architectural flourishes.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.184
I think it's lovely.

05:19.504 --> 05:20.448
I don't like it.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.472
I don't like it one bit.

05:21.936 --> 05:24.080
I know smiles.
And those smiles?

05:24.608 --> 05:25.872
They're just not right.

05:26.032 --> 05:29.024
Forget the smiles;
look at the Cutie Marks!

05:33.952 --> 05:36.232
OK, that's weird.

05:41.168 --> 05:43.552
An entire village with the
same Cutie Mark?

05:43.816 --> 05:44.992
How can that be?

05:45.192 --> 05:48.224
I bet there's some sort of
horrific monster behind it!

05:48.408 --> 05:49.688
What makes you say that?

05:49.864 --> 05:53.384
'Cause fighting a horrific
monster would be super awesome!

05:53.544 --> 05:55.128
I reckon we oughta
just head into town

05:55.136 --> 05:56.200
and talk to some locals.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.584
Find out what's goin' on.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.800
Great idea, AJ! Let's go.

06:01.496 --> 06:04.384
Those smiles are bad news!

06:09.530 --> 06:11.376
Welcome!
Welcome!

06:11.720 --> 06:12.552
Welcome!

06:12.816 --> 06:13.976
Welcome!

06:14.041 --> 06:15.140
Welcome!

06:15.176 --> 06:16.304
Welcome!

06:16.432 --> 06:17.456
Welcome!

06:18.040 --> 06:21.376
This must be the most
pleasant place in Equestria!

06:21.715 --> 06:22.748
Welcome!

06:24.064 --> 06:26.232
Ugh. Thanks a lot, map.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.272
Welcome!

06:28.800 --> 06:32.184
Pardon my forwardness,
but are you an alicorn?

06:33.240 --> 06:35.272
That there's the
Princess of Friendship!

06:35.656 --> 06:38.856
Well, you've certainly come to
the right place for friendship.

06:39.184 --> 06:40.784
What brings you to town?

06:41.230 --> 06:43.376
We're not
entirely sure.

06:43.728 --> 06:44.432
I see.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.168
Well, all are welcome here
in our little village.

06:47.340 --> 06:50.344
My name is Double Diamond
and this is Party Favor.

06:50.768 --> 06:51.880
Howdy, Double Diamond.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.616
I'm Applejack, and this here's
Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rarity,

06:55.624 --> 06:57.408
Rainbow Dash, and
Twilight Sparkle.

06:59.064 --> 07:02.176
And you all have your
own unique Cutie Marks.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.880
If you don't mind,

07:05.090 --> 07:07.856
has there been any sort
of trouble here lately?

07:08.288 --> 07:11.472
Why, I don't think
Trouble?
we've ever had trouble

07:11.488 --> 07:12.704
in our little village.

07:12.864 --> 07:13.656
It's true.

07:13.776 --> 07:14.488
You'll see.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.736
Perhaps you'd care to speak to
our founder, Starlight Glimmer.

07:19.512 --> 07:21.712
I wish everypony in Equestria

07:21.720 --> 07:24.240
was as friendly as
these ponies are.

07:24.504 --> 07:26.424
I've got my eye on them.

07:26.540 --> 07:30.248
Something's rotten in...whatever
the name of this village is

07:30.256 --> 07:31.272
that we're in right now.

07:34.056 --> 07:34.928
Starlight?

07:35.180 --> 07:36.856
We have some new visitors!

07:42.328 --> 07:43.512
Be ready to fight.

07:43.704 --> 07:45.704
We don't know what's gonna
come through that door.

07:47.944 --> 07:49.104
Welcome!

07:49.624 --> 07:52.170
I'm so pleased to
have you here.

07:54.464 --> 07:57.656
This is Applejack, Fluttershy,
Pinkie Pie, Rarity,

07:57.664 --> 08:00.256
Rainbow Dash, and
Twilight Sparkle.

08:03.952 --> 08:05.296
Forgive my bluntness,

08:05.312 --> 08:08.420
but I'm assuming it's
Princess Twilight Sparkle?

08:08.640 --> 08:11.296
We don't get many
alicorns around here.

08:11.736 --> 08:14.216
Yes. But Twilight is fine.

08:15.184 --> 08:18.344
So! How did you hear
of our little village?

08:18.528 --> 08:20.176
It's kind of a long story.

08:20.368 --> 08:22.224
Let's just say we
found it on a map.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.703
Technically it's a
tree-chest-castle-map.

08:27.736 --> 08:30.944
Well, however you found us,
we're happy to have you.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.360
We're happy to have anypony
who wants to experience

08:34.432 --> 08:37.448
true friendship for
the first time.

08:38.056 --> 08:39.000
Say what?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.376
Oh, indeed.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.944
That's what's so unique
about our village, you see.

08:43.192 --> 08:45.960
Around here, we don't
flaunt our special talents

08:45.976 --> 08:49.224
because we don't have any
special talents to flaunt.

08:49.664 --> 08:51.512
Is that why you all
have those Cutie Marks?

08:52.784 --> 08:54.848
Perhaps it would be
easier to understand

08:54.856 --> 08:57.344
if I gave you a tour
of the village.

Give up our Cutie Marks?

11:25.452 --> 11:26.548
No way!

11:26.708 --> 11:28.704
Rainbow Dash,
don't be so rude!

11:29.060 --> 11:30.512
I don't think we
should judge them.

11:30.752 --> 11:33.352
They all seem perfectly
happy with their choice.

11:33.516 --> 11:36.296
Don't believe their
smiles, Fluttershy.

11:36.692 --> 11:40.236
I'm sorry, I guess we're just a
little confused by all of this.

11:40.504 --> 11:43.288
We have no judgments
here in our village.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.000
Each of us was
confused once as well,

11:46.456 --> 11:49.668
blinded by the false
promise of our Cutie Marks.

11:49.912 --> 11:50.832
Whoa whoa whoa!

11:51.068 --> 11:52.520
Is she for real?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.084
When we were sent
to this village,

11:55.336 --> 11:58.760
we assumed it was to help
in some way, but...well,

11:59.020 --> 12:01.032
it doesn't seem like
you need any help.

12:01.808 --> 12:05.048
Have you considered perhaps that
you might have been sent here

12:05.064 --> 12:07.396
so we could help you?

12:09.032 --> 12:12.388
After all, nopony has
ever come to our village

12:12.404 --> 12:13.500
and wanted to leave.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.832
Why should you be any different?

12:16.552 --> 12:19.180
But that is entirely
your choice.

12:19.632 --> 12:22.944
Please, enjoy our little
corner of Equestria.

12:23.460 --> 12:24.912
We're all quite fond of it.

12:25.124 --> 12:27.124
No doubt you will be as well.

12:27.608 --> 12:29.924
Double Diamond, please
help our guests

12:29.948 --> 12:31.748
with whatever they
might need.

12:32.036 --> 12:33.316
Of course.

12:37.596 --> 12:40.916
Well, this will certainly
provide a boost

12:40.932 --> 12:42.496
to our little community.

12:42.984 --> 12:44.740
When the rest of Equestria sees

12:44.760 --> 12:47.732
that a princess gave up
her Cutie Mark to join us,

12:48.368 --> 12:52.612
they'll finally understand what
we're trying to accomplish.

12:55.804 --> 12:57.180
Welcome!

13:00.408 --> 13:02.084
A Cutie Mark is
a representation

13:02.112 --> 13:04.096
of a pony's unique
talents and skills.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.248
How is it possible to--

13:05.260 --> 13:08.248
What in the name
of Equestria is THAT?

13:09.284 --> 13:10.264
Welcome!

13:10.592 --> 13:12.568
Care to sample
some local fashion?

13:12.772 --> 13:14.480
We've got cloaks this month!

13:19.236 --> 13:22.808
Perhaps another time,
good sir, thank you.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.048
No wonder nopony's
wearing anything.

13:28.348 --> 13:30.888
Really, girls, they may do
things a bit differently

13:30.912 --> 13:33.796
than we're used to, but that's
no reason to be rude!

13:34.096 --> 13:35.724
No, the reason to be rude

13:35.740 --> 13:38.112
is that they all
keep staring at us.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.796
Need something?

13:42.180 --> 13:45.164
Uh, no, we're good.
Fluttershy's right.

13:45.460 --> 13:46.620
If we're going to
get to the bottom

13:46.636 --> 13:47.936
of why the map sent us here,

13:48.280 --> 13:49.884
we'll need the
help of these ponies.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.980
I think we ran off to
the end of Equestria

13:52.012 --> 13:54.008
before we even knew
what that map was!

13:54.244 --> 13:55.796
If we were at the
end of Equestria,

13:55.844 --> 13:57.916
we'd be sitting on
a big A!

13:57.952 --> 13:59.100
Hee Hee! Get it?

13:59.524 --> 14:02.428
Oh please, Miss Pie, this is
hardly the time for jokes.

14:03.028 --> 14:04.812
We've come all this
way and for what?

14:05.128 --> 14:07.556
Maybe you're right,
but we're here now.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.888
And it sure feels like
something's wrong.

14:10.236 --> 14:12.348
That and two bits'll
get you a cup of cider.

14:12.548 --> 14:13.732
Is this a bad time?

14:14.148 --> 14:15.560
We shouldn't be
bickering like this

14:15.592 --> 14:16.920
in front of our
new friends.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.328
Really, Applejack, you're
almost as bad as Rainbow Dash!

14:20.540 --> 14:22.068
Don't drag me
into this.

14:24.076 --> 14:25.428
Is your friendship ending?

14:25.716 --> 14:26.916
Are you crazy?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.864
We'd never let a disagreement
get in the way of food!

14:30.256 --> 14:33.108
OK, well. My
name is Sugar Belle.

14:33.584 --> 14:34.724
What can I bring you?

14:34.872 --> 14:35.676
We have...

14:35.796 --> 14:36.528
muffins.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.732
Then I guess we'll
take six muffins.

14:45.808 --> 14:46.712
Make that twelve.

14:47.524 --> 14:49.620
What? I'm hungry.

14:50.188 --> 14:52.268
Come on, girls, we've
got to stick together.

14:52.576 --> 14:55.544
It doesn't matter what happened
before; we're here now.

14:56.076 --> 14:57.420
I guess you're right.

14:57.728 --> 15:00.772
And the sooner we figure out
why, the sooner we can go home.

15:02.164 --> 15:03.668
Forgive me for
overhearing,

15:03.748 --> 15:06.324
but just a moment ago
you were disagreeing.

15:06.628 --> 15:09.124
And now it sounds
like you're agreeing.

15:09.748 --> 15:10.544
Uh-huh.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.252
Well, you had such
differing opinions.

15:13.352 --> 15:14.572
And Cutie Marks.

15:14.824 --> 15:17.740
We have differing opinions
all the time, darling.

15:18.148 --> 15:20.412
But you look like
you're friends.

15:20.656 --> 15:21.720
We are friends.

15:21.892 --> 15:24.144
A simple disagreement
wouldn't change that.

15:25.580 --> 15:28.528
I'm sorry, I'm just having
a hard time understanding.

15:28.984 --> 15:30.956
Different talents lead
to different opinions,

15:30.968 --> 15:33.040
which lead to
bitterness and misery.

15:33.344 --> 15:35.936
So, why aren't you
bitter and--

15:35.996 --> 15:36.612
Peh!

15:36.824 --> 15:37.456
Blech!

15:40.260 --> 15:43.016
Mmm...good!

15:43.700 --> 15:46.416
It's all right, I know
I'm not a very good baker.

15:46.856 --> 15:49.576
At least, I'm not any
better than anypony else

15:49.592 --> 15:50.560
in the village.

15:52.620 --> 15:55.612
Well, I hope you enjoy
our little village!

15:58.132 --> 15:59.264
Come inside before you go.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.628
Meet me downstairs.

16:05.608 --> 16:08.184
OK, that was weird, too.

16:08.928 --> 16:11.704
Let's all sit here and eat
these muffins and act normal.

16:12.152 --> 16:13.876
I think we're being watched.

16:17.784 --> 16:18.660
Ya think?

16:18.984 --> 16:20.200
No, not like that.

16:20.536 --> 16:23.304
I mean somepony here doesn't
want us talking to Sugar Belle.

16:28.428 --> 16:29.316
I got an idea.

16:29.712 --> 16:31.516
But you gotta eat all
them muffins, Pinkie.

16:31.888 --> 16:33.696
Me? Why me?

16:33.892 --> 16:35.724
You got a stronger
stomach than any of us

16:36.100 --> 16:37.976
and that filly in there
might be our best chance

16:37.984 --> 16:40.408
at findin' out what in the
hay is goin' on around here.

16:53.388 --> 16:57.080
I can't believe you ate all
our muffins, Pinkie Pie!

16:57.548 --> 17:00.680
We'd best go inside
and get some more!

17:02.156 --> 17:03.296
Nice work, Pinkie.

17:07.272 --> 17:10.132
I've accidentally eaten
cardboard tastier than that.

17:10.884 --> 17:12.800
Hello? Sugar Belle?

17:13.116 --> 17:14.268
Thank you for coming.

17:17.196 --> 17:18.864
Why did want us
to come down here?

17:19.164 --> 17:21.724
So nopony could see
what's about to happen.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.256
Are you really the
Princess of Friendship?

17:31.416 --> 17:33.108
Do you know Princess Celestia?

17:33.228 --> 17:35.652
I love your Cutie Mark!

17:35.864 --> 17:37.972
How can you be friends with
different Cutie Marks?

17:38.048 --> 17:39.688
Don't you end up
hating each other?

17:39.932 --> 17:42.800
Oh, look at this one!
This one's great too!

17:43.092 --> 17:45.264
I'd love to have my
special talent back,

17:45.388 --> 17:48.420
even just for a day...make
something besides those

17:48.432 --> 17:49.968
disgusting muffins.

17:50.324 --> 17:51.628
So what's stopping you?

17:51.896 --> 17:53.588
Go get your Cutie
Marks back.

17:53.904 --> 17:56.092
Daydreaming is one
thing, but you mean...

17:56.408 --> 17:58.272
actually having
it put back on?

17:58.812 --> 18:00.440
That seems extreme.

18:02.024 --> 18:03.836
I'm not sure Starlight
would like that.

18:04.108 --> 18:06.616
She wants us all to be
happy in our sameness.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.800
How do you take somepony's
Cutie Mark, anyway?

18:10.468 --> 18:13.820
The Cutie Unmarking is
a beautiful experience.

18:14.028 --> 18:16.316
Starlight uses the
Staff of Sameness

18:16.428 --> 18:19.540
to magically take them away
and replace them with these.

18:20.876 --> 18:23.716
But nopony should keep
you from your Cutie Mark.

18:23.976 --> 18:26.552
It represents such an
essential part of who you are!

18:26.964 --> 18:28.508
Oh, we're not kept from them.

18:28.776 --> 18:30.668
They're in the vault,
up in the caves.

18:30.796 --> 18:33.444
We can visit them any time
we like to remind us

18:33.468 --> 18:36.275
of the heartache of a life
with special talents.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.071
Can we visit this cave?

18:43.560 --> 18:46.782
I'm delighted you're interested
in our Cutie Mark vault!

18:47.115 --> 18:51.248
We hope someday every pony in
Equestria will make a pilgrimage

18:51.262 --> 18:54.680
here to our little village
to have theirs removed, too,

18:54.880 --> 18:56.040
And our message of ...

18:56.071 --> 18:57.755
This must be the
reason we're here.

18:58.115 --> 18:59.457
Pilgrimaging?

18:59.680 --> 19:02.751
No, helping those ponies
get their Cutie Marks back.

19:03.066 --> 19:04.897
Oh. Are you sure, Twilight?

19:04.933 --> 19:06.235
Maybe they missed
them a little,

19:06.533 --> 19:08.840
but even they didn't
seem all that unhappy.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.982
Then why did they want
to meet us in secret?

19:11.173 --> 19:13.142
And why did they ask us
not to tell Starlight

19:13.160 --> 19:14.631
who told us about the vault?

19:14.871 --> 19:16.573
Something's not right.

19:17.004 --> 19:18.342
Just through here!

19:22.351 --> 19:23.351
Behold!

19:26.937 --> 19:28.897
Our Cutie Mark vault.

19:32.795 --> 19:35.360
I've never seen
anything like it!

19:35.857 --> 19:39.528
And here is the
Staff of Sameness.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.168
It was one of the great
mage Meadowbrook's

19:42.182 --> 19:43.977
nine enchanted items.

19:44.377 --> 19:47.075
We are incredibly
fortunate to have it here.

19:47.542 --> 19:50.586
This is the tool that allows
us to free ourselves

19:50.697 --> 19:52.026
from our Marks.

19:52.906 --> 19:57.244
I'm curious; how did the
subject of the vault come up?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.231
Oh, some ponies
were telling us

19:59.257 --> 20:00.866
how much they missed
their Cutie Marks and--

20:00.893 --> 20:01.595
Pinkie!

20:01.968 --> 20:02.484
Oops.

20:03.404 --> 20:05.026
Were they!

20:05.213 --> 20:09.257
Well, it seems you inspire
all sorts of free thinking,

20:09.737 --> 20:10.760
don't you?

20:12.066 --> 20:14.986
We certainly didn't intend to
cause any disruptions

20:15.017 --> 20:16.306
to your charming
little--

20:16.324 --> 20:17.097
Good.

20:17.324 --> 20:19.933
Let's just make sure
of that, shall we?

20:23.662 --> 20:24.924
It's a trap!

21:02.244 --> 21:06.253
Oh, I don't blame you for what
you tried to do here today.

21:06.608 --> 21:09.373
You've spent your whole
lives thinking those Marks

21:09.391 --> 21:10.808
are a good thing.

21:11.231 --> 21:12.342
Give them back!

21:12.613 --> 21:17.337
Well! Now you can spend the rest
of your lives here with us.

21:17.582 --> 21:20.764
And we'll teach you just
how much better life can be

21:20.822 --> 21:23.617
without your Cutie Marks.
