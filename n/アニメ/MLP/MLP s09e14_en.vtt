to get here right away.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.942

britches about something.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.377

taking her so long?

Just kidding.

You guys really need to look
behind you once in a while.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.820
Uh, Pinkie, you said you
had something important

00:21.922 --> 00:22.621
to tell us.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.990
Not telling so
much as showing.

00:25.092 --> 00:27.059
In fact, what
you're about to see

00:27.161 --> 00:29.728
may SHAKE the very foundations
of your perception

00:29.830 --> 00:31.396
for all time!

00:32.800 --> 00:34.633
Um...a cupcake?

00:34.735 --> 00:37.602
YES! But wait!
There's more!

00:39.406 --> 00:40.639
It's an invitation
to visit

00:40.741 --> 00:43.175
the Cheese Sandwich
Amusement Factory!

00:43.277 --> 00:45.144
Cheese Sandwich
opened a factory?

00:45.246 --> 00:48.280
Heh. What do they make
there? Rubber chickens?

00:48.382 --> 00:51.316
That's ridiculous. They
make <i>way</i> more there

00:51.454 --> 00:52.937
than just rubber
chickens!

00:53.538 --> 00:56.321
Gosh, Cheese hardly
seems the factory type.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.724
I just assumed he'd
continue to wander Equestria

00:58.826 --> 01:02.094
throwing parties. Still, you
must be excited to see him.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.397
I am! I can't wait to tour
his factory, catch up,

01:05.499 --> 01:07.733
have him tell me my life's
purpose, swap gag tips...

01:07.835 --> 01:09.335
Whoa-whoa-whoa.
What did you say?

01:09.537 --> 01:12.037
Uh, catch up? I mean,
it has been a while.

01:12.139 --> 01:13.939
I think Applejack's
asking about the part

01:14.041 --> 01:16.575
about Cheese Sandwich
and your life's purpose?

01:16.877 --> 01:21.046
Oh, that. Yeah. It's just all
of you have found your thing.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.681
You're going to rule
all of Equestria.

01:22.783 --> 01:23.882
Rainbow Dash is
a Wonderbolt.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.450
Fluttershy has her
animal sanctuary.

01:25.552 --> 01:26.852
Rarity has her boutiques.

01:26.954 --> 01:30.722
Applejack has that
hat... and the farm,

01:30.824 --> 01:33.158

TWO things!

01:33.994 --> 01:35.861
I don't even have one.

01:38.399 --> 01:41.800
When I first got Cheese's
invite, I was a little jealous.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.069

he was moving on

01:44.171 --> 01:45.337
to bigger and
better things

01:45.439 --> 01:48.173
and everypony was
leaving me behind.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.842
But then I realized Cheese
Sandwich is a party pony

01:50.944 --> 01:51.977

Sandwich is a great idea,

one-size-fits-all joke,

12:09.329 --> 12:11.496
no grand unified gag theory.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.565
But, if we figure out
the funny of one gag,

12:14.667 --> 12:16.767
we can combine it with
the funny of another gag

12:16.869 --> 12:19.170
and make a third,
funnier, gag.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.975
I.. guess that makes sense.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.179
Rule of threes. Hm,
one, two, three.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.814
Yep, that math checks out!

12:30.316 --> 12:32.116
Hmmm. At this point,

12:32.218 --> 12:34.352
I'm willing to give
anything a try!

13:07.654 --> 13:10.288
I don't understand!
I've tried everything!

13:10.390 --> 13:13.291
Stand-up, classic gags,
physical humor, prop comedy,

13:13.393 --> 13:15.293
vaudeville, surrealist
alt-scene character pieces...

13:15.395 --> 13:16.895
Nothing's worked!

13:17.297 --> 13:19.263
It seems we've
exhausted every avenue

13:19.365 --> 13:21.933
that even the science
of comedy can provide.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.034
That's it, then.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.670
What do you mean?

13:24.772 --> 13:27.439
[sigh] I appreciate everything
you've done, Pinkie,

13:27.541 --> 13:30.942
but if you can't make
me laugh, nopony can.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.878
But, sir, you can't
just surrender.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.147
It doesn't look like
I have a choice.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.150
I need to figure out how
to live.. without a laugh.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.486
I know you tried your best,
but it's time you went home.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.192
I too am horrified.

13:53.066 --> 13:56.501
So that's it? You're
all just giving up?

13:56.903 --> 13:59.137
I'm afraid Mr.
Sandwich is right.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.306
You are the funniest
pony in Equestria

14:01.608 --> 14:03.174
and if you can't
bring back his laugh,

14:03.276 --> 14:05.243
it.. is surely
gone forever.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.246
But.. Cheese was just
as funny as me!

14:08.348 --> 14:10.514
I.. can't believe
that's all gone!

14:11.384 --> 14:12.317
None of us can.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.986
I shudder to think what
will become of the factory.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.121
You're not going to
close down are you!?

14:17.223 --> 14:20.224
I thought this place was
Cheese's life's purpose!

14:20.326 --> 14:23.194
It certainly was mine,
but if Mr. Sandwich

14:23.296 --> 14:25.263
has finally given up,
there's only so long

14:25.365 --> 14:26.831
we can re-tool
his old ideas

14:26.933 --> 14:28.666
before we run out
of gags to produce.

14:29.436 --> 14:33.071
I don't suppose.. you'd
consider working here?

14:33.173 --> 14:34.805
Your fresh take on
our classic gags

14:34.907 --> 14:36.941
rivals Mr. Sandwich
in his prime.

14:37.343 --> 14:39.010
I need to find my
life's purpose,

14:39.112 --> 14:40.611
but I don't
think that's it.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.812
I'm a party pony!

14:41.914 --> 14:44.349
I need to make ponies
happy in real time!

14:44.451 --> 14:48.353
Ah, yes. In our early days,
nothing brought Mr. Sandwich

14:48.455 --> 14:50.488
more pleasure than seeing the
laughter his gags brought

14:50.590 --> 14:51.856
to ponies first hoof.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.259
Guess it's back to
the drawing board.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.528
Well, there will always
be a place for you here

14:57.630 --> 14:58.630
if you change your mind.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.831
Hold on. What did
you just say?

15:00.933 --> 15:02.867
There'll always
be a place for you here?

15:03.069 --> 15:04.368
No-no-no-no. Before that.

15:04.470 --> 15:05.736
Back to the
drawing board?

15:05.938 --> 15:07.238
That was me!

15:07.640 --> 15:09.507
Nothing brought Mr.
Sandwich more pleasure

15:09.609 --> 15:11.175
than seeing the laughter
his gags brought

15:11.277 --> 15:12.477
to ponies first hoof?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.813
YES! That! We've been going
about this all wrong!

15:15.915 --> 15:17.948
We don't need to
make Cheese laugh.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.184
HE needs to make US laugh!

15:21.921 --> 15:25.323
Cheese! I figured it out!
I know why you can't laugh!

15:25.725 --> 15:26.991
What? Why?

15:27.193 --> 15:29.027
You started this factory
because you didn't want

15:29.129 --> 15:30.628
to disappoint
smiling faces,

15:30.730 --> 15:32.963
but in here you
can't see any!

15:33.967 --> 15:36.567
It does make a
certain sense, sir.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.170
Spreading laughter has
always brought you joy.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.273
But spreading laughter is
what this factory does.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.109
Except you don't SEE it.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.844
You're a party pony like me.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.747
You need to make
ponies smile in person!

15:53.052 --> 15:54.886
Here! Just try it!

15:55.388 --> 16:00.824
OK... Um, why did Boneless 2
cross the road?

16:01.728 --> 16:04.663
To prove to Boneless
1 he wasn't a chicken.

16:04.965 --> 16:10.835
Very funny sir. Excellent
joke. Oh! I mean, Ha. Ha, ha?

16:10.937 --> 16:11.836
Really..?

16:12.038 --> 16:14.139
Sorry. Not much of a laugher.

16:14.941 --> 16:18.643
Here. Try me. I
promise I'll laugh!

16:19.145 --> 16:21.279
Pinkie, you laugh
at everything.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.781
I appreciate what
you're doing,

16:22.883 --> 16:27.651
but I think it's a cost
laws, er, a lost cause.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.590
What. Was. That?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.825
I-I'm sorry. But when
you swapped the letters

16:34.927 --> 16:36.827
of those words,
it was just a bit...

16:37.764 --> 16:38.763

back to how things used to be!

19:39.912 --> 19:41.145
Sans, my good pony,

19:41.247 --> 19:43.881
I don't think I can run
this factory anymore.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.316
But YOU can!

19:45.418 --> 19:48.586
Without.. you? I
don't understand.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.689
Pinkie was right!
THIS is what I need!

19:54.293 --> 19:55.893
I just can't have
funny <i>ideas</i>!

19:55.995 --> 19:59.297
I need to wander the land and
see ponies laughing at them.

19:59.499 --> 20:03.801
You can run the factory,
but I need to LIVE!

20:04.103 --> 20:06.637
And don't think I've forgotten
about you, little buddy.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.109
I knew you'd be on board!

20:12.011 --> 20:15.446
Don't worry. Out in Equestria
I'll have more great ideas

20:15.548 --> 20:17.949
for gags and I'll
send them all to YOU!

20:18.251 --> 20:21.252
Sir, are you sure this
is what you want to do?

20:21.354 --> 20:24.021
Of course! It's
my life's purpose!

20:24.223 --> 20:26.891
Hey! That's what I
came here looking for.

20:27.193 --> 20:30.795
You did? Well, come on!
Let's figure it out!

20:35.701 --> 20:37.768
Actually... I
think I'm good.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.004
♪♪

20:40.106 --> 20:42.706
And then I said goodbye,
and then I came here!

20:42.808 --> 20:44.475
Oh, and then I gathered
you all together

20:44.577 --> 20:46.911
and started telling you
about it. First, I said-

20:47.013 --> 20:49.347
Well, that sounds
like quite a trip!

20:49.549 --> 20:52.983
And Cheese Sandwich just
left his own factory?

20:53.285 --> 20:55.286
Yep. But I think
Sans Smirk's hooves

20:55.388 --> 20:57.154
were the perfect
ones to leave it in.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.323
As much as Cheese was
born to wander Equestria

20:59.425 --> 21:00.824
and make ponies
laugh in person,

21:00.926 --> 21:03.461
Sans was born to
run that factory.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.195
And you don't so
sound so worried

21:05.297 --> 21:07.265
about finding your
life's purpose anymore.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.701
Nope! I figured out Cheese and
I are pretty much the same.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.804
We both need to see ponies
laughing to feel fulfilled.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.039
And I already do that.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.209
My life is purposing
itself all over the place!

21:18.411 --> 21:20.844
[chuckle] I agree
completely.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.180
Thanks. Oh, I
almost forgot!

21:23.282 --> 21:25.549
I got you all a little
something from my trip.

21:25.651 --> 21:27.885
Who likes peanut brittle..?
