WEBVTT

00:11.032 --> 00:12.154
What's wrong, Twilight?

00:13.008 --> 00:15.079
I've gone through every
book in Ponyville, Spike,

00:15.310 --> 00:17.637
and there isn't a single mention
of the mysterious chest

00:17.640 --> 00:19.176
that came from the
Tree of Harmony.

00:19.336 --> 00:21.592
Nor anything about
keys to unlock it.

00:22.048 --> 00:24.934
But something tells me that
opening it is pretty important.

00:25.754 --> 00:28.070
I hope Princess
Celestia has some ideas.

00:28.119 --> 00:30.394
If the Library in Canterlot
doesn't have anything,

00:30.400 --> 00:31.859
I don't know where
else to look.

00:32.259 --> 00:32.704
Ahhhh!

00:36.280 --> 00:39.365
My dearest Twilight, while it
would be perfectly lovely

00:39.379 --> 00:41.084
to have you in
Canterlot once more,

00:41.246 --> 00:42.803
I have another
option in mind

00:42.811 --> 00:44.593
much closer to Ponyville...

00:45.188 --> 00:47.071
<i>As you know,</i>
<i>the ancient Castle</i>

00:47.086 --> 00:49.043
<i>that I once shared</i>
<i>with Princess Luna</i>

00:49.063 --> 00:52.868
<i>lies mostly in ruins deep</i>
<i>in the Everfree Forest.</i>

00:53.266 --> 00:55.851
<i>But if you look carefully,</i>
<i>you may find a book</i>

00:55.875 --> 00:57.953
<i>that could prove helpful</i>
<i>to your research</i>

00:58.046 --> 01:01.278
<i>hidden somewhere in what's</i>
<i>left of the Castle library.</i>

01:06.675 --> 01:09.217
Wow! Look at all
these ancient books.

01:09.231 --> 01:11.947
It's a veritable gold
mine of information.

01:11.976 --> 01:14.825
I can't believe
it! Woo-hoo!

01:15.059 --> 01:16.288
Whoa!

01:18.991 --> 01:19.621
Gah!

01:20.593 --> 01:25.069
Heh, heh. So, Twilight.
Uh, ready to head home?

01:25.457 --> 01:26.679
Are you kidding?

01:26.887 --> 01:28.702
This place is PERFECT!

01:38.880 --> 01:45.150

02:17.467 --> 02:20.204
I'm not gonna move.
You move.

02:20.255 --> 02:24.249
Uh-uh. There's no way
I'm moving.

02:24.413 --> 02:27.116
This is the most daring
dare any pony ever dared

02:27.133 --> 02:28.671
dare another pony to dare.

02:28.995 --> 02:29.633
Huh?

02:29.851 --> 02:31.129
It's exciting!

02:35.322 --> 02:36.400
What y'all doing?

02:37.020 --> 02:39.176
Rainbow Dash and Applejack are
competing for the title

02:39.186 --> 02:40.640
of Most Daring Pony.

02:40.868 --> 02:42.513
This is the final test.

02:42.669 --> 02:44.042
The Bee Stare.

02:44.138 --> 02:46.033
Last pony to blink wins.

02:47.131 --> 02:49.051
I'm gonna need my bees back.

02:49.857 --> 02:54.060
But then we'll never find out
who the Most Daring Pony is.

02:54.318 --> 02:55.748
Sorry about that.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.903
Well, what do we do now?

03:01.356 --> 03:05.270
Don't worry ladies, I've been
keeping excellent score all day.

03:05.426 --> 03:08.995
Hmm. move the decimal,
carry the two, and ...

03:09.145 --> 03:10.130
Congratulations!

03:10.185 --> 03:11.367
You're tied!

03:11.601 --> 03:12.271
Tied?

03:12.556 --> 03:16.378
You can't be tied for
the Most Daring Pony.

03:16.575 --> 03:17.246
I don't know.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.866
Numbers don't lie.

03:22.645 --> 03:24.536
I'd love to stay and
keep keeping score,

03:24.569 --> 03:26.511
but I promised to help
test the new school bell.

03:26.593 --> 03:29.356
I get to ring it
all week non-stop.

03:29.387 --> 03:30.638
And I don't even
have to take turns

03:30.679 --> 03:32.600
because no one
else volunteered!

03:34.214 --> 03:35.806
OK. No problem.

03:35.933 --> 03:38.476
We just have to come up
with another daring dare.

03:38.524 --> 03:39.114
Right.

03:44.798 --> 03:47.297
I think I might have an
idea of what we can do.

03:50.983 --> 03:54.446
Um... Rarity, don't you think
it's a little late in the day

03:54.468 --> 03:55.955
to be walking through
the forest?

03:56.017 --> 03:58.920
It is Star Spider
season, after all.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.197
Though I'm sure you have
a very good reason...

04:02.421 --> 04:05.845
Simply the most important reason
I've ever had in my entire life.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.015
Oh. Well, then I'm
happy to help.

04:08.277 --> 04:09.082
What is it?

04:09.264 --> 04:12.398
I've heard rumors that the
Castle of the Two Sisters

04:12.448 --> 04:15.520
is filled with the most gorgeous
of ancient tapestries

04:15.570 --> 04:17.469
in all of Pony History.

04:17.496 --> 04:20.400
It pains me to think of those
magnificent creations

04:20.425 --> 04:24.370
rotting away in those old
ruins, totally unappreciated.

04:24.821 --> 04:26.302
I see.

04:26.524 --> 04:29.631
I require your help in
borrowing one or two

04:29.656 --> 04:31.861
to bring back to the boutique
where I can restore them.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.776
Maybe I'll even use the
patterns as the inspiration

04:34.794 --> 04:35.884
for a new line.

04:36.466 --> 04:37.779
That does sound...

04:38.222 --> 04:39.941
very important.

04:40.214 --> 04:43.646
Yes, well, maybe not the
most important thing

04:43.658 --> 04:45.082
in my entire life,

04:45.447 --> 04:47.972
but retro-ancient
classical will be all the rage

04:47.992 --> 04:50.142
next season, so it's
nothing to sneeze at.

04:58.199 --> 05:01.611
Um, are you sure you
need those tapestries?

05:01.902 --> 05:02.839
But, of course.

05:03.231 --> 05:06.749
Although, I must admit,
these ruins are a fright.

05:07.576 --> 05:09.650
Look at all the
dirt everywhere.

05:09.875 --> 05:10.439
Ew.

05:11.996 --> 05:13.639
Angel!

05:22.410 --> 05:24.909
It's practically an
artistic treasure trove

05:24.920 --> 05:26.600
of ancient good taste.

05:28.784 --> 05:31.557
Angel, you really shouldn't
have run off like that.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.949
Ancient ruins are filled with
all sorts of things

05:33.960 --> 05:34.969
that can hurt you.

05:34.993 --> 05:37.906
You could stub your toe
or trip on a loose stone.

05:38.013 --> 05:39.722
You have to be careful.

05:44.958 --> 05:47.135
I don't think I'll need
all these candles, Twilight.

05:47.213 --> 05:48.878
I was really only
scared for a second.

05:48.903 --> 05:50.470
Oh, these aren't
for you, Spike.

05:50.665 --> 05:52.632
We're going to be studying
late into the night

05:52.727 --> 05:54.548
and we're going to need
all the light we can get.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.822
Oh. Great.

05:58.044 --> 06:00.534
Well? Here we are!

06:00.632 --> 06:03.317
Eh ? What's so daring
about this place?

06:03.666 --> 06:05.562
This is where we got the
Elements of Harmony.

06:06.025 --> 06:08.880
When I was just a filly,
Grannie Smith told me

06:08.924 --> 06:10.261
of an ancient legend...

06:10.398 --> 06:12.296
When Nightmare
Moon was banished,

06:12.539 --> 06:16.007
not every last bit of her
dark magic went with her.

06:16.300 --> 06:20.230
<i>Grannie used to say when</i>
<i>night falls on the Castle,</i>

06:20.577 --> 06:23.434
that magic takes the form of...

06:23.578 --> 06:26.737
THE PONY OF SHADOWS.

06:26.952 --> 06:28.597
You mean like a ghost?

06:28.958 --> 06:32.464
No pony knows.

06:32.513 --> 06:33.391
Ugh!

06:35.346 --> 06:37.424
This one is perfect!

06:37.551 --> 06:41.502
Well, it certainly could
use some restoration.

06:41.828 --> 06:42.665
Be a dear.

06:42.848 --> 06:44.657
Fly up there and lift
it off that hook.

06:50.466 --> 06:52.392
Maybe from below?

07:00.833 --> 07:03.586
I don't see what's so
daring about an old legend.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.149
Plus, I don't
believe in ghosts.

07:07.229 --> 07:10.156
You might wanna re-think
your position on that.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.545
You saw that, right?

07:23.738 --> 07:24.881
RUN!

07:29.680 --> 07:31.929
Ow, I think I hurt my wing.

07:32.224 --> 07:34.437
Oh, my dear, I
am so sorry.

07:34.565 --> 07:36.035
That tapestry is
far too heavy.

07:36.054 --> 07:37.678
We'll just have to
find a smaller one.

07:38.413 --> 07:40.052
Oh. Of course.

07:40.117 --> 07:42.296
Where, pray tell, did
you disappear to?

07:42.661 --> 07:43.775
What do you mean?

07:43.892 --> 07:45.761
While you were struggling
under that fabric,

07:45.779 --> 07:47.404
the entire wall
spun around.

07:47.828 --> 07:49.715
You must have activated
a secret door.

07:50.183 --> 07:51.447
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:52.161 --> 07:55.032
I suppose these ruins
are chock-full of them.

07:55.440 --> 07:55.996
Really?

07:56.117 --> 07:56.874
Absolutely.

07:57.123 --> 07:59.231
We must use the
utmost care as we...

08:05.155 --> 08:08.343
OK. So maybe the
legend is true.

08:08.390 --> 08:10.253
Well, that's why I
brought you here.

08:10.439 --> 08:12.874
I guess only the most
daring pony of all

08:12.905 --> 08:14.146
could stay in this
castle all night

08:14.154 --> 08:15.434
without
being scared off.

08:18.165 --> 08:18.735
Scared?

08:19.153 --> 08:20.329
I'm not scared.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.360
Well, me neither!

08:22.507 --> 08:23.654
Then it's settled.

08:24.068 --> 08:28.569
Whoever stays in the Castle the
longest is the Most Daring Pony.

08:29.863 --> 08:30.573
Deal!

08:31.828 --> 08:35.373
But it's gonna take a lot more
than some shadowy ghost pony

08:35.383 --> 08:36.940
to get me to leave.

08:37.242 --> 08:38.733
Me, too.

08:46.669 --> 08:47.904
Find anything, Spike?

08:48.852 --> 08:50.300
Uh... Nope.

08:50.388 --> 08:51.287
Nothing yet.

08:52.634 --> 08:53.541
Aaaaaah!

08:54.483 --> 08:55.125
Angel?

08:55.510 --> 08:56.852
What are you doing here?

09:08.070 --> 09:10.971
The Journal of the
Two Sisters.

09:11.457 --> 09:15.040
Maybe this is the book Princess
Celestia was talking about!

09:16.489 --> 09:19.771
I sure hope you're not afraid
of the dark, Applejack.

09:19.799 --> 09:22.837
I can't say that I am,
but even if I was,

09:22.950 --> 09:25.254
I'd be at least fifty percent
less scared of it

09:25.266 --> 09:27.090
than you, Rainbow Dash.

09:28.128 --> 09:30.199
I don't know how all
that math works because

09:30.308 --> 09:31.701
I'm not scared at all.

09:31.791 --> 09:32.936
Me neither.

09:34.241 --> 09:34.977
Huh?

09:37.086 --> 09:38.610
What's the matter?

09:39.047 --> 09:43.869
It's just a dark hallway full
of disembodied pony legs.

09:44.542 --> 09:48.210
Yeah. Nothing
creepy about that.

09:51.619 --> 09:54.046
<i>I'm starting to wonder</i>
<i>if maybe this castle</i>

09:54.050 --> 09:55.740
<i>doesn't want my expertise.</i>

09:57.217 --> 09:57.861
Oh, dear.

09:58.097 --> 09:58.901
Angel?

09:59.244 --> 10:00.620
Rarity, have you seen him?

10:01.174 --> 10:03.787
I'm not sure he made the
trip down with us, dear.

10:03.992 --> 10:04.969
Oh, goodness.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.132
We have to find him.

10:06.228 --> 10:08.437
An ancient castle is
no place for a bunny.

10:08.497 --> 10:10.220
He could get hit
by falling debris

10:10.341 --> 10:12.126
or the floor could
give out under him.

10:12.185 --> 10:16.191
Oh! He could be trapped in a
dark place with no way out.

10:16.357 --> 10:18.901
I can only imagine
how that might feel.

10:19.935 --> 10:21.268
Hmmm.

10:25.646 --> 10:29.322
Applejack, if you're scared,
you can just admit it.

10:29.668 --> 10:31.480
You don't need to put
your hoof around me.

10:31.857 --> 10:34.448
Uh... I'm over here.

10:44.306 --> 10:46.031
Rarity, what is it?

10:46.310 --> 10:47.426
I felt something.

10:47.925 --> 10:49.319
ALIVE!

10:49.629 --> 10:51.108
Angel!

10:57.986 --> 11:01.404
Well, tapestries or no, I have
had just about enough

11:01.420 --> 11:04.253
of secret passages,
mysterious presences

11:04.318 --> 11:06.103
and unappreciative castles.

11:07.707 --> 11:09.030
But we can't leave now.

11:09.155 --> 11:12.173
Not with Angel lost somewhere
in this dangerous old Castle.

11:12.388 --> 11:14.819
He could be trapped
under a crumbling statue

11:14.860 --> 11:18.474
or stuck high in a tower
without food or water

11:18.509 --> 11:20.872
or any friends at all!

11:23.127 --> 11:25.410
Spike, you've got to hear this.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.625
I love to duck behind
the paintings

11:27.728 --> 11:29.055
and though the Hall of Hooves

11:29.063 --> 11:30.774
still gives her a
bit of a fright,

11:30.784 --> 11:33.600
the trap door slide
is Luna's favorite.

11:34.078 --> 11:35.510
Hall of Hooves?

11:36.456 --> 11:39.123
Soon the Organ to the
Outside will be finished.

11:39.153 --> 11:40.692
I can hardly wait.

11:41.209 --> 11:43.754
What's the Organ
to the Outside?

11:43.962 --> 11:45.810
I have no idea.

11:57.408 --> 11:58.396
You hear that?

11:59.713 --> 12:03.221
You mean the creepy sound
of a haunted pipe organ?

12:03.363 --> 12:05.350
Uh... Maybe.

12:05.633 --> 12:07.859
I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:12.409 --> 12:14.216
Uh, Twilight?

12:14.536 --> 12:15.836
Did you hear something?

12:16.033 --> 12:16.901
Oh, Spike.

12:17.178 --> 12:18.801
Quit being such
a scaredy dragon.

12:19.024 --> 12:20.936
This castle is
thousands of years old

12:20.948 --> 12:23.274
and half of it was destroyed
by Nightmare Moon.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.192
Of course it makes
strange sounds;

12:25.338 --> 12:27.080
it's practically
falling apart.

12:30.505 --> 12:31.867
OK.

12:33.428 --> 12:37.360
Angel? Angel?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.094
I'm sure we'll find him.

12:40.688 --> 12:41.350
Angel?

12:44.940 --> 12:45.791
Did you find Angel?

12:45.832 --> 12:47.031
Is he OK?

12:48.228 --> 12:50.202
They are perfect!

12:50.679 --> 12:53.385
No castle in its right mind
could possibly object

12:53.399 --> 12:55.754
to my restoring such
exquisite works of art.

12:55.931 --> 12:58.054
Oh, they're lovely, Rarity,

12:58.099 --> 13:00.622
but I have to keep
looking for Angel.

13:00.922 --> 13:03.687
I hope he doesn't think
I've given up on him.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.746
I'm right behind you.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.665
Won't be a moment...

13:13.190 --> 13:15.365
Do you think there's a
single room in this Castle

13:15.373 --> 13:17.849
that isn't filled with
terrifying things?

13:20.476 --> 13:21.155
Whoa!

13:21.884 --> 13:22.530
Heh heh.

13:23.209 --> 13:25.038
It's just old pony armor.

13:25.059 --> 13:25.964
What's the big deal?

13:26.343 --> 13:27.002
Yeah.

13:27.342 --> 13:29.871
It's not like it's going
to come to life or anything.

13:30.255 --> 13:30.868
Right?

13:37.570 --> 13:37.998
Huh?

13:54.230 --> 13:56.144
Whoa!

14:16.022 --> 14:18.189
Now, you look here, Castle.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.992
You are very old and
very scary,

14:21.190 --> 14:23.756
but your wall art is
in an atrocious state

14:25.416 --> 14:27.537
and there is nothing you
can do to keep me

14:27.541 --> 14:29.559
from my sacred task
of restoration.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.127
Uh, Applejack?

14:33.728 --> 14:36.950
If you went back to
Ponyville, that means I win.

14:37.252 --> 14:37.697
Right?

14:44.973 --> 14:46.337
Rarity?

14:48.251 --> 14:50.696
I know hiding isn't really
your sense of humor,

14:50.999 --> 14:53.806
but please let this be a joke.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.040
Rainbow?

15:09.280 --> 15:10.640
Hello?

15:13.516 --> 15:17.680
I guess if I don't find you,
I win by default. Right?

15:25.102 --> 15:25.886
Oof!

15:30.003 --> 15:31.566
Of all the castles
in Equestria,

15:31.572 --> 15:34.050
this is by far the
most ungrateful.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.213
Oof!

15:42.675 --> 15:44.242
Angel!

15:44.244 --> 15:46.277
Rarity?

15:46.279 --> 15:49.213
Oh, I hope you two
are together.

15:58.770 --> 16:01.139
Haunted statues, creepy armor...

16:01.828 --> 16:04.210
Come on, Castle, is
that all you got?

16:20.704 --> 16:23.959
I was only trying to restore
ancient art!

16:29.795 --> 16:30.519
Angel?

16:33.980 --> 16:37.373
ANGEL!

16:37.853 --> 16:39.178
What it the world is that?

16:39.510 --> 16:40.858
Oh, you know.

16:41.047 --> 16:44.380
Probably just more strange
sounds of this old castle

16:44.396 --> 16:45.240
falling apart.

16:46.228 --> 16:48.113
No one likes sarcasm, Spike.

16:54.487 --> 16:56.083
What got into them?

16:59.553 --> 17:00.491
It's OK, Angel.

17:00.569 --> 17:02.366
You're OK. YOU'RE OK!

17:03.420 --> 17:05.043
Shadows everywhere!

17:09.690 --> 17:12.191
Angel!

17:12.232 --> 17:14.491
All right. Everypony STOP!

17:16.751 --> 17:17.533
Twilight?

17:17.824 --> 17:18.388
Must.

17:18.735 --> 17:19.402
Save.

17:19.888 --> 17:20.561
Angel.

17:22.068 --> 17:22.620
Oh.

17:23.793 --> 17:24.638
Fluttershy?

17:24.776 --> 17:26.048
What are you doing here?

17:26.154 --> 17:27.381
She's with me.

17:33.717 --> 17:34.766
Thank you!

17:35.008 --> 17:36.464
Have you all spent
the whole night

17:36.476 --> 17:38.316
running around
scaring each other?

17:38.505 --> 17:40.440
Well, that depends.

17:40.774 --> 17:42.062
On what?

17:42.190 --> 17:45.908
On whether or not you're
the Pony of Shadows?

17:46.122 --> 17:48.388
What's the Pony of Shadows?

17:48.425 --> 17:50.747
Oh, that's just an
old pony's tale.

17:53.143 --> 17:55.578
Then who's playing that?

17:56.060 --> 17:57.937
We're going to find out.

18:26.821 --> 18:28.560
THE PONY OF SHADOWS!

18:44.788 --> 18:45.707
Hey, you guys.

18:45.734 --> 18:47.512
Did you know I can
totally play the organ?

18:47.523 --> 18:49.034
Because I didn't.

18:49.377 --> 18:50.694
PINKIE!

18:50.975 --> 18:51.703
Check it out.

18:53.816 --> 18:56.234
You're the Pony
of Shadows?

18:56.640 --> 18:57.758
The Pony of what?

18:58.226 --> 18:59.900
See? What did I tell you?

19:00.245 --> 19:02.517
I thought you had to ring
the school bell all week.

19:02.796 --> 19:03.307
Oh, yeah.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.287
I only had to ring
it for like, five minutes.

19:05.338 --> 19:06.487
They said that was good enough.

19:06.558 --> 19:08.212
I can't imagine why.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.028
So, then I decided to throw a

19:13.034 --> 19:14.796
Finished Ringing The
School Bell party,

19:14.954 --> 19:16.076
but I didn't have
any bluebells

19:16.085 --> 19:18.495
and you can't throw a Finished
Ringing The School Bell party

19:18.503 --> 19:21.172
without bluebells so I went to
Everfree forest to pick some,

19:21.180 --> 19:22.680
but it started to
get so chilly

19:22.698 --> 19:24.452
I had to wrap myself up in
the tarp I was gonna use

19:24.460 --> 19:25.239
to gather flowers

19:25.293 --> 19:26.735
And then I saw
Fluttershy and Rarity,

19:26.794 --> 19:27.953
but they went into the Castle

19:27.959 --> 19:29.564
before I could invite
them to my party.

19:29.623 --> 19:31.283
Luckily, I followed
them inside

19:31.299 --> 19:32.946
so I could help you all
with your party.

19:33.742 --> 19:34.985
What party is that?

19:35.200 --> 19:37.467
Uh, The Everypony Come To
The Scary Old Castle

19:37.475 --> 19:39.892
And Hide From Each Other While
I Play The Organ Party.

19:43.225 --> 19:43.951
Duh!

19:51.535 --> 19:54.089
I swear this is going right
back where I found it

19:54.091 --> 19:56.881
just as soon as I've returned
it to its former glory.

19:57.838 --> 19:59.943
Now don't go running off again.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.694
Ooh. I can't believe I
was so frightened.

20:02.991 --> 20:05.410
I guess I let my imagination
get the best of me.

20:05.695 --> 20:07.319
I think we all did.

20:07.525 --> 20:09.808
I always let my imagination
run away from me.

20:10.058 --> 20:12.347
Then it comes back with cake.

20:13.758 --> 20:16.366
Well, it's good to know that
whenever your imagination

20:16.376 --> 20:19.693
is getting away from you, a good
friend can help you rein it in.

20:20.007 --> 20:21.707
And even though I didn't
find anything out

20:21.717 --> 20:23.295
about the mysterious chest,

20:23.621 --> 20:25.670
I'm glad I was here to
help all of you.

20:25.908 --> 20:27.982
You certainly did
that, Twilight.

20:28.468 --> 20:31.028
Yeah, why weren't you scared?

20:31.250 --> 20:34.011
Reading Celestia's diary
made it hard to be afraid

20:34.021 --> 20:36.862
because I knew what it was like
when she and Luna lived here.

20:37.051 --> 20:38.405
Knowing something
about the past

20:38.411 --> 20:40.999
made it easier to deal with my
problems in the present,

20:41.451 --> 20:42.932
even the scary ones.

20:47.014 --> 20:49.049
I just thought of a great idea!

20:49.332 --> 20:50.741
Why don't we keep a journal?

20:50.757 --> 20:52.885
Just like the Royal
Pony Sisters?

20:53.026 --> 20:54.152
All of us?

20:54.854 --> 20:57.336
Sure! That way we can
learn from each other.

20:57.615 --> 21:00.027
And maybe someday other
ponies will read it

21:00.031 --> 21:01.346
and learn something too.

21:01.547 --> 21:03.670
What a splendid idea!

21:03.908 --> 21:06.035
I know what my
first entry will be.

21:06.331 --> 21:10.759
Dear Diary, I'm glad Grannie
Smith's legend wasn't true.

21:11.242 --> 21:12.288
Me too.

21:12.759 --> 21:15.240
Me three, because
that means you two

21:15.252 --> 21:18.653
are still tied for
Most Daring Pony!

21:21.223 --> 21:23.229
Ha! Shadow ponies.

21:23.379 --> 21:25.055
How ridiculous is that?
