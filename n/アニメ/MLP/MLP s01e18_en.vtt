WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:04.365
Where are you takin' us?

00:04.582 --> 00:06.093
We're almost there, young 'uns.

00:06.180 --> 00:07.841
I've never been here before.

00:12.445 --> 00:13.269
Ouch!

00:13.421 --> 00:14.859
Oh. Sorry.

00:14.902 --> 00:16.158
Are we there yet?

00:16.602 --> 00:19.865
There? Where? What?
I don't even know what we're doing.

00:19.866 --> 00:21.184
Here we are.

00:21.185 --> 00:22.451
What are we lookin' at?

00:22.651 --> 00:24.410
I have no idea.

00:24.510 --> 00:25.895
What is that thing?

00:25.896 --> 00:30.282
Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome
to your new clubhouse.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.207
Well, don't thank me all at once.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.794
This was my clubhouse when I was your age.

00:40.465 --> 00:42.513
Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but...

00:42.514 --> 00:45.366
...it's empty and on a secluded
private part of the farm.

00:45.726 --> 00:47.221
And it's all yours.

00:48.417 --> 00:50.970
It just needs a little, uh... TLC.

00:51.070 --> 00:54.504
TLC as in Tender Loving Care
or Totally Lost Cause?

00:54.774 --> 00:59.103
Applejack! We're supposed to turn
this into our new clubhouse?

00:59.328 --> 01:03.170
Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks
when you discover your talent for...

01:07.190 --> 01:08.150
...house cleanin'?

02:36.639 --> 02:38.607
Wow! Hi, Scootaloo!

02:38.608 --> 02:41.737
Back already? You're 'mazin' on that scooter.

02:41.738 --> 02:44.117
Thanks! Wow, Apple Bloom.

02:44.118 --> 02:45.999
You did all of this?

02:46.000 --> 02:51.022
Yep! I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off
the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted...

02:51.316 --> 02:54.385
That's so cool. What's Sweetie Belle up to?

02:54.817 --> 02:58.773
<i>We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders...</i>

03:03.008 --> 03:06.177
<i>...never stop the journey...</i>

03:07.853 --> 03:09.349
There you are, Sweetie Belle!

03:09.749 --> 03:14.050
See? I told you we could find her
by followin' her totally awesome voice.

03:14.135 --> 03:15.946
What's that sweet tune you're singing?

03:16.153 --> 03:20.139
Oh. I was just working on our new
Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.774
COOL!

03:21.960 --> 03:23.098
Teach us?

03:23.363 --> 03:25.723
Well, I've only come up with one part...

03:25.823 --> 03:26.995
...but okay!

03:27.683 --> 03:31.040
<i>They all say that you will get your mark</i>

03:31.041 --> 03:34.994
<i>When the time is really right</i>

03:34.995 --> 03:39.491
<i>And you know just what you're supposed to do</i>

03:39.492 --> 03:42.495
<i>AND YOUR TALENT COMES TO LIGHT!</i>

03:43.288 --> 03:48.912
Well, uh... I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders.
You've done one fine job with this place.

03:49.225 --> 03:50.383
So, what's next?

03:50.718 --> 03:53.109
Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse...

03:53.110 --> 03:54.948
And a map of Ponyville.

03:54.970 --> 03:57.336
And a Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.

03:57.623 --> 03:58.477
Theme song?

03:58.478 --> 04:01.175
We're gonna go out in the world
and discover our talents.

04:01.176 --> 04:02.713
A new adventure!

04:02.714 --> 04:04.633
And earn our cutie marks.

04:04.681 --> 04:06.342
We'll leave no stone unturned!

04:06.343 --> 04:08.309
No mountain unclimbed!

04:08.310 --> 04:10.028
No meal uncooked!

04:10.029 --> 04:11.591
No sock unwarmed!

04:11.698 --> 04:15.271
Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan.

04:15.608 --> 04:16.569
I gotta, uh...

04:16.892 --> 04:19.141
Leave no apple unpicked!

04:19.460 --> 04:20.511
See y'all later!

04:21.314 --> 04:23.889
Are we ready to get our cutie marks, ponies?

04:24.287 --> 04:25.320
Ready!

07:20.987 --> 07:22.746
I had nothing to do with this.

07:22.747 --> 07:24.297
What is going on here?

07:25.212 --> 07:28.430
Well, we sure aren't gettin'
our cutie marks for bein' librarians.

07:28.626 --> 07:30.267
Huh. I should think not.

07:30.629 --> 07:31.664
What?

07:31.665 --> 07:34.398
Girls, I think you're going
about this the wrong way.

07:34.399 --> 07:36.985
Instead of trying to do things
in areas you're not familiar with...

07:36.986 --> 07:39.473
...why not try doing things
in areas that you already like?

07:39.673 --> 07:42.304
And I have the perfect place to start.

07:44.270 --> 07:45.982
"Showcase your talents..."

07:45.983 --> 07:47.141
"...for all to see..."

07:47.142 --> 07:50.093
"Perform in the Ponyville school talent show."

07:50.383 --> 07:52.037
There'll be all sorts of awards.

07:52.038 --> 07:55.536
Best dramatic performance,
best comedy act, best magic act...

07:55.537 --> 07:57.568
Surely you can find your talent.

07:57.854 --> 08:00.819
This *would* be the perfect place
to discover our talents.

08:00.933 --> 08:03.621
-Jugglin'!
-Acting!
-Magic tricks!

08:03.726 --> 08:06.920
-Square dancin'!
-Tightrope walking!
-Tiger taming!

08:06.921 --> 08:09.712
My little ponies! You're missing the point.

08:09.713 --> 08:12.676
Think about the things you already enjoy doing.

08:12.677 --> 08:14.805
Think about what you're already good at.

08:15.204 --> 08:16.569
Sure! We can do that.

08:16.570 --> 08:18.271
Yeah! Sure we can.

08:18.272 --> 08:20.901
Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as...

08:21.001 --> 08:23.776
...The Cutie Mark Crusaders!

08:30.189 --> 08:34.192
Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things.

08:34.292 --> 08:36.383
Come back with my supplies!

08:36.439 --> 08:38.701
We're just borrowing them for the talent show.

08:38.901 --> 08:42.224
Don't worry, sis. I promise we'll bring them back.

08:44.140 --> 08:47.563
Thanks, Mr. Breezy.
We'll return the fan to you real soon.

08:49.212 --> 08:51.014
What do we need this fan for?

08:51.015 --> 08:52.598
Trust me on this one.

08:55.095 --> 08:59.134
Okay, so that's six wooden planks,
4 by 8 plywood, a box of nails...

08:59.135 --> 09:02.056
...four cans of paint and four brushes.
Anything else?

09:02.536 --> 09:08.218
Yeah. Instructions on how to use six wooden
planks, 4 by 8 plywood, a box of nails...

09:08.219 --> 09:10.146
...four cans of paint and four brushes.

09:14.894 --> 09:17.186
"Ghost, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures"?

09:17.266 --> 09:20.420
Good heavens, girls.
What do you need a book like this for?

09:20.792 --> 09:22.662
You'll see. Thanks, Twilight.

09:22.761 --> 09:24.989
We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.645
What do you think they're up to?

09:26.745 --> 09:30.965
I have no idea and I don't know if
I should be excited or scared to find out.

09:32.099 --> 09:34.201
I'm glad we're doin' this as a team.

09:34.597 --> 09:35.457
Me too.

09:35.811 --> 09:38.036
Um... so what are we doing again?

09:38.202 --> 09:41.940
A super awesome dramatic song
for the talent show, of course.

09:42.176 --> 09:46.183
Right! With super-cool scenery.
And amazing costumes.

09:46.408 --> 09:48.569
And mind-blowin' dance moves.

09:48.570 --> 09:50.832
This is gonna be so amazing!

09:51.161 --> 09:53.639
Sweetie Belle, I think you should be a singer.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.764
What? No way I'm singing in front of a crowd.

09:56.765 --> 09:59.198
Twilight said to do something we like to do.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.894
And I'd like to be like my big sister.

10:01.895 --> 10:03.389
And she's a designer.

10:03.648 --> 10:06.284
Fine then. You can do
the costumes and the scenery.

10:06.659 --> 10:09.573
And Scootaloo, you're great
in maneuvers on your scooter.

10:09.574 --> 10:11.360
So you should do the choreography.

10:11.429 --> 10:13.455
You know, all those dance moves.

10:17.053 --> 10:19.853
Nah. I'd rather sing a wicked rock ballad.

10:20.691 --> 10:23.144
Why don't you come up with
the dance routine, Apple Bloom?

10:24.990 --> 10:26.617
I'm not much of a dancer...

10:27.061 --> 10:30.277
...but I do like Kung-fu.
That's kinda like dancin'.

10:35.023 --> 10:37.776
Then it's settled! Let's get started.

10:44.091 --> 10:46.398
One... two... three...

10:49.073 --> 10:51.611
Ow, Apple Bloom! What are you doing?

10:53.173 --> 10:56.001
Oh, I feel like I have four left feet.

10:56.218 --> 10:58.254
I can't even spin right.

10:58.276 --> 11:03.192
Don't be silly. You just gotta keep your head
forward until very the last minute. Like this.

11:06.490 --> 11:08.394
See? Easy-peasy.

11:08.395 --> 11:10.436
You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all.

11:10.599 --> 11:14.163
Wow! That does look easy. Thanks.

11:14.587 --> 11:16.802
Okay. Let's try this again.

11:22.792 --> 11:24.129
I'm okay!

11:24.166 --> 11:25.564
Keep practicing!

11:25.664 --> 11:26.932
Will do.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.452
We fight the fight, walk the walk.

11:31.453 --> 11:33.818
Talk the talk, eat a... uh...

11:33.819 --> 11:36.500
...food like a celery stalk?

11:38.211 --> 11:40.925
I'll never come up with anything!

11:40.964 --> 11:42.685
Never, never, never!

11:45.465 --> 11:47.265
Come back! Come back!

11:48.580 --> 11:49.872
Dumb fabric.

11:50.430 --> 11:52.569
Hey Scoot! How's the song going?

11:55.755 --> 11:57.758
Oh my! Sounds serious.

11:57.958 --> 12:01.865
I'm just no good at lyrics.
Coming up with words is, like...

12:02.436 --> 12:04.035
...really hard.

12:04.066 --> 12:06.080
Oh, it can't be that bad.

12:06.904 --> 12:09.809
With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria.

12:09.810 --> 12:13.291
We use our stomachs to... digestia?

12:15.386 --> 12:17.917
Well... These are... um...

12:17.918 --> 12:21.931
...good, but... How about after
"We fight the fight"...

12:21.932 --> 12:25.418
<i>There is nothing that we fear</i>

12:25.419 --> 12:29.628
<i>We'll have to figure out what we'll do next</i>

12:29.629 --> 12:33.576
<i>Till our cutie marks are here</i>

12:33.765 --> 12:36.408
Wow! That's so awesome!

12:36.409 --> 12:38.191
Did you just come up with that now?

12:38.490 --> 12:40.233
Yeah... kind of.

12:40.335 --> 12:42.642
Thanks, I'm totally using that.

12:51.072 --> 12:52.245
Oh no!

13:06.936 --> 13:10.182
One, two, three, four, FIVE?!

13:16.886 --> 13:18.517
How's the spin coming along?

13:18.518 --> 13:21.148
I think I'll gotta just stick to punches and kicks.

13:23.580 --> 13:26.163
You know, ponies only have four legs.

13:27.616 --> 13:30.784
I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity.

13:31.731 --> 13:33.436
Hey, it's no big deal.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.161
Why don't you use the dress form?

13:35.162 --> 13:38.695
It'll help you with your patterns and help
you put all the pieces in the right places.

13:38.696 --> 13:40.873
Oh, is that what that's for?

13:40.874 --> 13:44.791
Uh... maybe you should also clean
your paintbrush between each color.

13:45.504 --> 13:48.435
Oh, I was wondering why
all the colors looked like mud.

13:48.706 --> 13:50.789
You're not using power tools, are you?

13:52.704 --> 13:56.265
The talent show is just around the corner.
I wonder how the fillies are doin'.

13:58.638 --> 14:01.088
-Oh! Sorry, Scootaloo.
-That's okay.

14:01.089 --> 14:03.291
Ugh! Oops! Sorry, Scootaloo.

14:03.292 --> 14:05.700
-Ouch!
-Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.672
Let's sing the chorus again!

14:09.783 --> 14:13.375
Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.374
I think that sounded pretty good.

14:15.474 --> 14:17.697
Me too. You think we're ready?

14:17.997 --> 14:19.594
Ready as we'll ever be.

14:20.406 --> 14:22.325
Hey! Did you see us practicing?

14:22.476 --> 14:24.190
Uh... Yeah.

14:24.191 --> 14:26.114
Well? How do we do? How do we do?

14:26.496 --> 14:27.987
Uh...

14:28.328 --> 14:31.613
Speechless! See, girls?
I told you that's what we're gonna do.

14:31.614 --> 14:33.986
We're gonna leave them speechless.

14:33.987 --> 14:35.703
YAY!

14:35.903 --> 14:37.822
"Speechless" is right.

14:46.833 --> 14:48.557
...and on the count of three...

14:48.558 --> 14:54.171
...this rabbit will disappear and something
tasty will reappear in its place.

14:54.172 --> 14:57.263
A one, a two and a three!

14:58.220 --> 15:00.346
Hey! Where are they?

15:00.422 --> 15:01.808
Snails, where are the...

15:03.639 --> 15:04.683
...carrots.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.672
SNAILS!

15:09.387 --> 15:13.367
Uh, how about a round of applause
for the S&S magic act?

15:13.368 --> 15:19.721
Now for our next act we have Sunny Days and
Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem...

15:19.722 --> 15:21.283
...on rollerskates!

15:24.205 --> 15:25.395
Break a leg!

15:25.671 --> 15:28.052
Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say!

15:28.252 --> 15:33.323
No, no, no. You see, in the theater
it's considered bad luck to say "good luck".

15:33.324 --> 15:35.390
So you say "break a leg" instead.

15:35.539 --> 15:37.899
My little ponies! How are you doing?

15:38.201 --> 15:39.797
Nervous...

15:40.043 --> 15:42.018
Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing.

15:42.019 --> 15:44.258
Remember, just stick to what you know best.

15:44.259 --> 15:46.715
I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle.

15:46.716 --> 15:50.228
Why does everypony always
think I'm gonna sing?

15:50.229 --> 15:53.707
Actually, Twilight Sparkle,
I'm the main singer tonight.

15:55.091 --> 15:57.884
And I'm the main dancer. Hai-ya!

15:59.367 --> 16:01.269
And I'm in charge of...

16:01.369 --> 16:02.710
Costumes?

16:02.711 --> 16:05.507
And sets and props. How'd you know?

16:05.710 --> 16:08.361
Really, girls? Are you sure...

16:08.691 --> 16:11.701
Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're on next.
Break a leg.

16:12.095 --> 16:13.417
-Break a le...
-Ugh!

16:13.418 --> 16:14.904
Uh... good luck!

16:21.318 --> 16:24.570
<i>Look, here are three little ponies</i>

16:24.850 --> 16:28.105
<i>Ready to sing for this crowd</i>

16:28.493 --> 16:31.860
<i>Listen up cause here's our story</i>

16:31.937 --> 16:36.192
<i>I'm gonna sing it VERY LOUD!</i>

16:43.096 --> 16:46.388
<i>When you're a younger pony</i>

16:46.567 --> 16:49.869
<i>And your flank is very bare</i>

16:50.376 --> 16:53.958
<i>Feels like the sun will never come</i>

16:53.959 --> 16:56.909
<i>When your cutie mark's not there</i>

16:57.447 --> 17:00.445
<i>So the three of us fight the fight</i>

17:01.106 --> 17:04.129
<i>There is nothing that we fear</i>

17:04.572 --> 17:08.403
<i>We'll have to figure out what we'll do next</i>

17:08.404 --> 17:12.005
<i>Till our cutie marks are here</i>

17:12.481 --> 17:16.610
<i>We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders</i>

17:16.662 --> 17:19.604
<i>On a quest to find out who we are</i>

17:19.751 --> 17:23.483
<i>And we will never stop the journey</i>

17:23.891 --> 17:26.883
<i>Not until we have our cutie marks</i>

17:33.949 --> 17:36.852
<i>They all say that you'll get your mark</i>

17:37.659 --> 17:40.892
<i>When the time is really right</i>

17:41.225 --> 17:44.879
<i>And you know just what you're supposed to do</i>

17:44.880 --> 17:47.856
<i>And your talent comes to light</i>

17:48.547 --> 17:51.738
<i>But it's not as easy as it sounds</i>

17:51.974 --> 17:55.054
<i>And that waiting's hard to do</i>

17:55.642 --> 17:59.347
<i>So we test our talents everywhere</i>

17:59.348 --> 18:02.878
<i>Until our face is blue</i>

18:03.619 --> 18:07.365
<i>We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders</i>

18:07.633 --> 18:10.485
<i>On a quest to find out who we are</i>

18:10.710 --> 18:14.696
<i>And we will never stop the journey</i>

18:14.808 --> 18:17.699
<i>Not until we have our cutie marks</i>

18:17.916 --> 18:21.767
<i>We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders</i>

18:22.105 --> 18:24.915
<i>On a quest to find out who we are</i>

18:25.243 --> 18:28.980
<i>And we will never stop the journey</i>

18:29.231 --> 18:32.542
<i>Not until we have our cutie marks!</i>

18:49.270 --> 18:52.549
Wow. That did not go as well as I expected.

18:52.550 --> 18:55.061
I can't believe they're laughin' at us.

18:55.296 --> 18:57.326
Was it that bad?

18:57.514 --> 19:00.714
Back on stage, girls. It's time for the awards.

19:00.810 --> 19:03.219
Back on stage? No.

19:03.319 --> 19:05.341
They'll just laugh some more.

19:05.441 --> 19:07.255
Yeah, what's the point?

19:07.455 --> 19:09.793
Now girls, let's be good sports.

19:09.794 --> 19:12.511
You made a great effort. You should be proud.

19:12.512 --> 19:13.688
Now come on!

19:14.866 --> 19:17.929
Let's hear it for all
our talented fillies and colts.

19:21.038 --> 19:22.858
Our first award goes to...

19:23.035 --> 19:26.235
Snips and Snails for best magic act.

19:29.763 --> 19:32.786
Hey! Mine's at least shinier.

19:32.787 --> 19:34.571
Well, mine's bigger.

19:35.030 --> 19:38.243
Oh yeah, well... Well, mine is, uh... heavier?

19:38.244 --> 19:39.854
The next award goes to...

19:39.855 --> 19:44.822
Sunny Days and Peachy Pie
for best dramatic performance.

19:46.941 --> 19:50.712
And finally, the last award
of the night goes to...

19:55.284 --> 19:57.780
The Cutie Mark Crusaders!

19:57.781 --> 19:59.039
What?

19:59.302 --> 20:01.364
For best comedy act.

20:14.167 --> 20:16.530
Can you believe it? We won!

20:16.830 --> 20:18.877
I knew our act was awesome.

20:18.878 --> 20:20.571
You know what would be the best?

20:20.771 --> 20:23.632
If we won *and* we got our cutie marks.

20:30.107 --> 20:33.961
Congratulations, ponies! Job well done.

20:33.962 --> 20:36.322
Thanks, Twilight.

20:36.323 --> 20:38.881
Hey, you don't sound too excited.

20:39.521 --> 20:44.748
We worked really hard and won a prize
but we still don't have our cutie marks.

20:45.103 --> 20:47.883
Which is the prize we really wanted.

20:48.258 --> 20:49.886
Oh, girls...

20:49.887 --> 20:51.895
But we think we know why.

20:51.896 --> 20:53.424
Yes. We know why.

20:53.639 --> 20:57.845
Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make
a special report to the Princess.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.127
Well, maybe we were trying too hard?

21:01.128 --> 21:03.728
Yes? And...

21:03.729 --> 21:07.722
And instead of forcing ourselves to
do something that's not meant for us...

21:07.827 --> 21:09.479
Yes... Yes...

21:09.480 --> 21:12.648
We each should be embracing our true talent!

21:12.649 --> 21:14.304
And that is...?

21:15.145 --> 21:16.539
Comedy!

21:18.877 --> 21:21.230
Apple Bloom! You did it!

21:21.330 --> 21:24.336
Did you see our award? Weren't we funny?

21:26.213 --> 21:29.594
One day... One day...

21:31.992 --> 21:35.492
