WEBVTT

00:15.049 --> 00:16.715
Oh, no I have to...

00:25.058 --> 00:26.759
I can't believe the winter
to spring transition

00:26.761 --> 00:28.594
is almost here.

00:28.596 --> 00:32.498
La. La. La. laaaa. Oh, I
know. I love it so much,

00:32.500 --> 00:35.200
I gave it its own
term: Springsition!

00:35.202 --> 00:36.668
Ha ha ha ha !

00:36.670 --> 00:39.805
Oooh. I like that.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.241
I'm going to have to
re-label all my binders.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.642
Right after we finish--

00:43.644 --> 00:49.314
--Everything! We still
have so much to do!

00:49.316 --> 00:52.451
Oh, my bustles and
bows! Rarity, did we--

00:52.453 --> 00:55.287
Already hemmed, ruched
and cuffed, my dear.

00:56.690 --> 00:57.756
Oh!

00:57.758 --> 01:03.595
Rarity, no reason to panic,
but um, we seem to be

01:03.597 --> 01:06.198
temporarily low. And when
I say "temporarily low",

01:06.200 --> 01:07.833
I mean completely out of--

01:07.835 --> 01:11.236
--The baby blue sapphires?
They arrived this morning.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.238
Oh! Wonderful!

01:15.508 --> 01:17.743
Oh! What
about the design for the--

01:17.745 --> 01:18.877
--And done.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.613
Wow. You are good.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.850
And you've really outdone
yourself this time!

01:24.852 --> 01:29.154
The Morning Sunshine
Tulip frock is gorgeous.

01:29.156 --> 01:32.691
Oh, thank you. Now, I know
you're worried about something

01:32.693 --> 01:34.493
slipping between the cracks.

01:34.495 --> 01:39.164
but with your managerial skills
and my fabulous designs

01:39.166 --> 01:41.633
we have everything covered.

01:41.635 --> 01:45.804
You're right, you're right.
There are no cracks.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.873
Would you be a dear and fetch
me some vermillion satin

01:47.875 --> 01:48.773
from the back?

01:48.775 --> 01:49.873
And I'll start on the

01:49.875 --> 01:52.444
Eternal Elegance Empire
silhouette evening gown.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.746
My most certain pleasure.

01:58.152 --> 02:02.421
Oh! I love this picture!

02:02.423 --> 02:05.424
When was the last time we had
that kind of fun together?

02:05.426 --> 02:09.661
I... I can't remember.
Has it been that long?

02:09.663 --> 02:11.663
I guess I've been so
busy running my shop.

02:11.665 --> 02:15.300
Oh, no. Something, or
should I say somepony

02:15.302 --> 02:16.401
is slipping between
the cracks!

02:18.672 --> 02:21.473
I miss my Sweetie Belle!

02:21.475 --> 02:25.410
Rarity, we're running
low on vermillion satin.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.851
I... I can order more!

03:16.297 --> 03:19.665
...and this is when we pretended
we were storybook princesses

03:21.535 --> 03:23.402
and here we pretended

03:23.404 --> 03:26.338
we were on a dangerous-
yet-stylish safari...

03:28.475 --> 03:32.711
So many wonderful memories!

03:39.687 --> 03:42.688
Not to put too fine a
point on it but ....

03:47.494 --> 03:54.633
Sweetie Belle loves playing
dress up. I miss her so much!

03:55.368 --> 03:58.503
Then why don't
you go visit her?

03:58.505 --> 04:02.808
I wish I could, but between
running three stores

04:02.810 --> 04:06.445
and the springsition,
I couldn't possibly!

04:06.447 --> 04:08.614
But you've already
done almost all the work.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.882
I can handle the rest.

04:10.884 --> 04:11.582
But--

04:11.584 --> 04:15.320
Rarity, go! I have
everything well in hoof.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.292
Point taken.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.861
I am going to visit my sister!

04:22.863 --> 04:25.330
Way to immediately
turn that around!

04:25.332 --> 04:26.965
We can spend the
whole day together!

04:26.967 --> 04:29.401
And we can do all of
her favorite things!

04:29.403 --> 04:31.270
I'm sure she'd
love that!

04:31.272 --> 04:33.305
Oh, Sassy, thank you!

04:33.307 --> 04:35.641
Of course! Now
get out of here!

04:35.643 --> 04:37.743
I'm going! I'm going!

04:37.745 --> 04:40.846
Hang on, sis. I'm coming!

04:47.620 --> 04:48.754
Excuse us!

04:48.756 --> 04:50.355
Coming through!

04:50.357 --> 04:52.457
Cutie Mark Crusaders
mid-mission, here!

05:06.740 --> 05:09.074
That was fun!
Let's do it again!

05:09.076 --> 05:11.476
Scoot, we've got
a job to do.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.376
Later?

05:12.878 --> 05:15.947
All right, Chip Cutter.
We've done our part.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.949
The rest is up to you.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.519
You really think I have
it in me to be a sculptor?

05:20.521 --> 05:21.687
Yup.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.355
But... why?

05:25.058 --> 05:27.359
Because you said you
weren't good at anything

05:27.361 --> 05:28.994
except getting in trouble
for making sculptures

05:28.996 --> 05:31.563
out of your lunch, right?

05:31.565 --> 05:35.400
Yeah. I can't help it.
When I look at my sandwich,

05:35.402 --> 05:39.104
it's like it's just asking
me to turn it into a dragon.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.774
Well, what is this slab asking
you to turn it into?

05:46.512 --> 05:49.348
Hmmmm. I see.

06:01.028 --> 06:04.096
Apple Bloom: Wow!
That's incredible!

06:04.098 --> 06:05.931
It looks
just like us!

06:05.933 --> 06:07.966
We knew you had
it in you, Chip.

06:07.968 --> 06:11.036
This is way better than
sandwich sculpting!

06:11.038 --> 06:13.572
Chip, we're proud of you.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.748
I finally got my cutie mark!

06:22.750 --> 06:24.583
Woo-hoo! All right!

06:24.585 --> 06:25.484
Yes!

06:25.486 --> 06:26.585
Way to go!

06:31.691 --> 06:35.794
Not a bad way
to start a day.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.996
Not a bad way
at all.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.899
Helping ponies is just about
my favorite thing to do.

06:42.635 --> 06:45.070
Another satisfied client!

06:45.072 --> 06:46.638
Mm hm!

06:49.041 --> 06:50.842
So who's up next?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.511
Pretty sure it's Zipporwhill.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.546
She needs help reconnecting
with her cutie mark:

06:54.548 --> 06:55.914
three puppy paw prints.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.214
When is she swinging by?

06:57.216 --> 07:02.153
Well, I think she should be
arriving right about now.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.158
Wow, you are good!

07:06.160 --> 07:08.660
Come on in, Zipporwhill.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.897
OK, so what seems to
be the problem exactly?

07:11.899 --> 07:16.735
It's my puppy, Ripley.
We used to be so close.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.671
In fact, I got my cutie
mark the day I found him

07:19.673 --> 07:21.673
and took him home.

07:21.675 --> 07:25.811
But now, it's like he wants
nothing to do with me.

07:25.813 --> 07:29.047
Don't you worry; you've
come to the right place.

07:29.049 --> 07:32.451
The Cutie Mark Crusaders
are on the job.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.186
Trust us, before
you know it,

07:34.188 --> 07:37.722
you and your puppy will
be back to being besties!

07:37.724 --> 07:40.091
You have the CMC guarantee!

07:40.093 --> 07:41.391
No matter what it takes,

07:41.393 --> 07:44.162
we promise you'll have
our full attention.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.131
Guess who's here to
spend the whole day

07:46.133 --> 07:48.166
with her little sister?

07:48.168 --> 07:49.534
Rarity!

07:49.536 --> 07:50.635
Whoa!

07:57.510 --> 08:00.946
So sorry, dear! You're tiny.
I didn't even see you there!

08:00.948 --> 08:03.148
Tend to get carried
away with my entrances!

08:03.150 --> 08:04.950
<i>♪ Ta da! ♪</i>

08:04.952 --> 08:07.953
Rarity, what are
you doing here?

08:07.955 --> 08:11.656
I am here to spend
the day with you!

08:11.658 --> 08:13.925
I'm so excited, I could
practically faint.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.094
You don't happen to have a
fainting couch in here, do you?

08:16.096 --> 08:18.530
NO!

08:18.532 --> 08:21.533
Of course not!
It's a tree house.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.702
That would be
très gauche.

08:23.704 --> 08:28.707
Right, well, I sure am happy to
see you! And spending the day

08:28.709 --> 08:31.042
with you does sound like
a lot of fun, but...

08:32.778 --> 08:35.780
I'm kinda right in the middle
of something important.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.716
I have responsibilities and--

08:37.718 --> 08:38.984
Oh...

08:41.721 --> 08:45.156
Go on, Sweetie Belle.
We've got this covered.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.659
How often do you get to
spend time with your sister?

08:47.661 --> 08:50.128
Yeah, go have fun.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.064
You sure you two can
handle our client here?

08:53.066 --> 08:58.236
"Client?" Oh, that
is so adorable!

08:58.238 --> 09:00.839
Uh, thanks? I think?

09:03.543 --> 09:08.046
Oooh! You have mints to
offer your 'clients'!

09:08.048 --> 09:10.015
How 'professional'!

09:12.619 --> 09:15.253
Are you sure you
two got this?

09:15.255 --> 09:17.322
We have it handled.

09:17.324 --> 09:23.028
Oh, my! Look at this
wall of satisfied customers!

09:23.030 --> 09:26.798
You girls really
have come a long way.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.267
Well, all right then.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.637
But let me know if you need
me or run into any trouble!

09:32.639 --> 09:35.740
Come on, come on. You'll never
guess what I have planned!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.217
[squeal] So fun!

09:49.322 --> 09:51.356
What?

09:51.358 --> 09:55.193
It's just I know how much
you love these puppet shows!

09:55.195 --> 09:56.393
I did.

09:56.395 --> 10:00.765
Oh, it's just like old times!
You, me, greasy popcorn...

10:02.368 --> 10:04.703
... it's like no time
has passed at all!

10:16.949 --> 10:18.950
Ooh! Ooh! It's
your favorite part!

10:34.401 --> 10:39.204
Banana peels are so
very, very slippery!

10:39.206 --> 10:42.140
It's funny because
it's true!

10:45.679 --> 10:47.646
What's the matter, darling?

10:47.648 --> 10:51.683
I um, guess I just prefer black
box experimental theater.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.786
What? Since when?

10:54.788 --> 10:57.322
I don't know. It's no
big deal. This is great.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.998
OK, we're here!

11:07.000 --> 11:08.667
<i> ♪ Ta-da! ♪</i>

11:13.739 --> 11:16.141
Aren't you excited to
be back here again?

11:16.143 --> 11:20.278
Do I know my baby sister,
or do I know my baby sister?

11:20.280 --> 11:25.083
Uh... yeah. Where
is "here," exactly?

11:25.085 --> 11:28.119
Oh! Stop being so silly.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.155
You know this is your
favorite ice cream shop!

11:32.391 --> 11:36.961
Oh, right. From when
I was a little filly.

11:36.963 --> 11:40.331
And I convinced the original
owner to come out of retirement

11:40.333 --> 11:42.901
to make you your all-time
favorite dessert!

11:52.745 --> 11:56.181
Huh. I remember it
being much bigger.

11:56.183 --> 12:00.151
Well, go ahead. I know
you're dying to dig in.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.991
Well?

12:06.993 --> 12:12.430
That was... uh...
one tasty bite.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.833
Still a little hungry though.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.801
We can get another sundae!

12:16.803 --> 12:19.237
Chocolate with rainbow
sprinkles perhaps?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.506
I was thinking something
more like a salad.

12:21.508 --> 12:25.944
A salad? When did
you get so practical?

12:25.946 --> 12:29.948
Oh, um. I guess another
scoop would be fine!

12:29.950 --> 12:32.183
One more filly clown
surprise, please!

12:39.825 --> 12:41.059
Hey, Ripley!

12:41.061 --> 12:42.794
Look at me, over here!

13:00.046 --> 13:02.914
I know you must
be bored, darling.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.517
This is a very long line for
one of Twisty Pop's balloons!

13:09.055 --> 13:11.523
But just be patient; we'll
get you your favorite

13:11.525 --> 13:14.125
balloon bouquet and
it'll all be worth it!

13:22.435 --> 13:27.472
Who's a good puppy? Who's a good
puppy? You're the good puppy!

13:31.477 --> 13:35.480
Now come on, puppy-wuppy.
Get the bally-wally.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.351
Come on, Ripley!
Like this!

13:44.256 --> 13:46.457
Good, Scootaloo! See?

13:49.963 --> 13:52.096
It's not working.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.866
Maybe if the ball
tasted better?

13:54.868 --> 13:56.401
I don't think
that's it, Scoot.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.238
Doesn't look like
it's going so well.

14:00.240 --> 14:04.042
I'm just gonna do a quick
check with the CMC's.

14:04.044 --> 14:09.914
Well, I guess duty calls
and you have that now.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.149
What?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.852
Nothing, nothing, go on.

14:13.854 --> 14:17.121
Hey Sweetie Belle, how's
your day with Rarity going?

14:17.123 --> 14:21.192
Well, it's not exactly great.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.492
What do you mean?

14:22.494 --> 14:26.464
I don't know, it's like Rarity
doesn't even know me anymore.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.601
I wish we could say our
day is going better--

14:32.339 --> 14:35.206
--but we can't.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.041
Seems like Zipporwhill's puppy

14:37.043 --> 14:38.977
doesn't want anything
to do with her!

14:45.017 --> 14:48.419
Hmmm. I see what you mean.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.589
Ya know, it's an
awfully big puppy.

14:51.591 --> 14:55.226
Sweetie Belle! Hurry;
he's making it!

14:55.228 --> 14:56.561
Gotta go.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.537
I know just what
to do with this!

15:10.677 --> 15:12.076
And pose!

15:14.113 --> 15:16.147
And pose!

15:16.149 --> 15:17.682
Love the camera!

15:17.684 --> 15:20.285
Hate the camera.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.486
Love it again!

15:25.591 --> 15:30.295
Sweetie Belle, you did "hate the
camera" for all these shots!

15:30.297 --> 15:32.297
Let's do it again.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.164
No!

15:35.201 --> 15:37.468
C'mon Zipporwhill,
you can do this!

15:48.515 --> 15:50.581
What do you mean no?

15:50.583 --> 15:56.187
Rarity, this is hard for
me to say, but... um...

15:56.189 --> 15:58.389
Sweetie Belle, what is it?

15:58.391 --> 16:00.658
You've been acting
weird all day.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.328
You used to love doing
these things with me!

16:03.330 --> 16:08.599
That's just it! I used to!
That's not who I am anymore.

16:08.601 --> 16:12.570
This isn't who I am. My cutie
mark must be for something else

16:12.572 --> 16:16.040
because my puppy just
doesn't love me anymore!

16:19.979 --> 16:23.681
But it is you. You love
puppet shows and dressing up

16:23.683 --> 16:27.752
and taking silly photos and tiny
little clown-shaped ice creams!

16:27.754 --> 16:31.155
Really?! If you still think
I like doing this stuff,

16:31.157 --> 16:33.358
then maybe you don't
know me at all.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.506
I can't believe Sweetie Belle
talked to me like that.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.742
And after everything I
did to set up a whole day of

16:50.744 --> 16:53.077
doing her favorite things!

16:53.079 --> 16:56.080
I mean, accusing me
of not knowing her!

16:56.082 --> 16:58.082
I know her better than anypony!

17:01.353 --> 17:04.756
Thank you, Twisty, but the
hard truth is my sister

17:04.758 --> 17:07.792
is being unappreciative
right now.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.395
And I'm going to go and give
her a piece of my mind!

17:16.668 --> 17:19.237
Hey, Zipporwhill. What
are you doing here?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.205
Where are Apple
Bloom and Scootaloo?

17:21.207 --> 17:23.307
They're with my puppy.

17:23.309 --> 17:27.512
He seems to like them
better than me anyway.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.415
Now I'm sure that's not true.

17:30.417 --> 17:34.786
It is. He doesn't like doing
anything with me anymore.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.091
He didn't even want
to play with this.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.460
And all puppies love these.

17:47.467 --> 17:51.069
I think that might be your
problem right there. Come on!

17:58.477 --> 18:01.846
Find Zipporwhill, Ripley.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.582
Woof woof. Zipporwhill woof?

18:07.219 --> 18:08.853
It's hopeless.

18:08.855 --> 18:09.953
Sweetie Belle!

18:09.955 --> 18:15.226
Zipporwhill! We're sorry we
haven't figured this out yet.

18:15.228 --> 18:18.463
Don't worry, girls; I
think I cracked this one.

18:20.332 --> 18:25.203
There she is! Oh, dear.
Really should have changed.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.172
No matter. I'm going to give
her quite the talking to!

18:29.541 --> 18:32.310
Right after she's done
with her conversation.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.279
Anger is no excuse for
poor manners, after all.

18:35.281 --> 18:39.117
OK. Zipporwhill,
what do you see?

18:39.119 --> 18:40.751
My puppy?

18:40.753 --> 18:45.656
That's not what I see.
I see a full grown dog.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.693
He did get bigger, I guess.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.829
He's not just bigger,
he's older too.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.234
You don't still play
with the same toys

18:56.236 --> 18:59.237
from when you were
a foal, do you?

18:59.239 --> 19:05.810
Oh. Ohhh! This squeaker is
a little small for him now.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.779
It's just hard for me to
believe he's not the same

19:08.781 --> 19:11.716
adorable little guy
I found anymore.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.752
I understand. But doing
things like you used to

19:14.754 --> 19:17.288
won't turn him
back into a puppy.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.557
So what do I do?

19:19.559 --> 19:21.559
Treat him like the dog he is

19:21.561 --> 19:23.828
and find new favorite
things to do together.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.329
You think so?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.497
I know so!

19:26.499 --> 19:28.666
Rarity!?

19:28.668 --> 19:32.670
Oh, Sweetie Belle. I heard what
you said and you are so right.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.205
About the dog?

19:34.207 --> 19:37.375
Yes, but about us, too!

19:37.377 --> 19:40.878
The truth is, I know you're
not a little filly anymore.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.780
But it's just the
last time we did

19:42.782 --> 19:46.951
all of those things together,
I... I didn't realize

19:46.953 --> 19:52.256
it was going to be
the last, last time.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.625
I loved doing those
things with you;

19:54.627 --> 19:56.861
it's hard for me to
let that go.

19:56.863 --> 20:02.900
Aw, Rarity. I love being with
you too. That will never change!

20:02.902 --> 20:06.204
But maybe we could just try to
do different things together?

20:16.316 --> 20:19.917
What is it, puppy?
I mean, Ripley?

20:29.595 --> 20:31.696
I love you too, Ripley.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.368
Thank you, Crusaders!

20:37.370 --> 20:39.337
No problem!

20:42.675 --> 20:45.443
Sweetie Belle, I
am so very proud

20:45.445 --> 20:47.845
of the pony
you've grown into.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.248
And I'm proud that
no matter what,

20:50.250 --> 20:53.284
I'll always be
your little sister.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.286
I uhh, have a little bit of time

20:55.288 --> 20:57.521
before I have to
head to Canterlot.

20:57.523 --> 21:00.358
Could we spend it together?

21:00.360 --> 21:03.661
What would a grown pony
like you want to do?

21:03.663 --> 21:07.365
Well, I do have one idea.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.475
I didn't realize your idea
would be such a delicious one.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.644
I don't know how I'm
going to finish this.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.445
Oh, I'll help you!
