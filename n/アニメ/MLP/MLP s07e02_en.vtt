00:03.588 --> 00:08.336
Come on, come on! Turn
into a tea cup.

00:10.516 --> 00:12.024
No. Tea cup!

00:12.988 --> 00:16.576
No! Tea cup! No!

00:18.544 --> 00:22.004
Starlight, I can't put a
trick that's not working

00:22.024 --> 00:25.000
into my act. How come
it's not working?

00:25.860 --> 00:28.400
It could be because you're
just yelling "tea cup"

00:28.448 --> 00:30.516
and not picturing
it in your mind.

00:31.244 --> 00:33.240
Oh. Yeah, that
could be it.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.100
What does your
tea cup look like?

00:35.184 --> 00:36.908
What shape is
it? What color?

00:42.624 --> 00:44.792
Woo! Starlight, I
did it!

00:46.684 --> 00:49.736
I did it, I did it,
I did it!

00:50.236 --> 00:50.856
Hey!

00:51.060 --> 00:55.264
Tea cup! Tea cup!
Tea cup! Tea cup! Tea cup!

00:55.656 --> 01:00.668
Teeeaa Cup! Tea Cup!
Tea Cup! Teeeaa Cup!

01:00.984 --> 01:02.904
You know what you
need? A tea cup!

01:09.320 --> 01:10.412
Oh!

01:10.960 --> 01:13.828
Whoops, I guess I
pictured a tea cup poodle.

01:14.656 --> 01:17.948
Trixie, you ruined
my tea cakes!

01:18.400 --> 01:19.572
I just got excited!

01:19.752 --> 01:22.552
This is the first time I
did a transfiguration spell.

01:22.832 --> 01:27.056
Real magic! C'mon.
Be impressed by me!

01:27.328 --> 01:28.960
"Yay Trixie!

01:29.024 --> 01:32.148
You are so great at magic
and having good hair."

01:33.344 --> 01:37.160
Good job, Trix, but
I was baking these to give

01:37.198 --> 01:39.531
to Twilight and the girls for
their friendship retreat.

01:39.636 --> 01:41.620
Pinkie Pie gave me her
recipe and everything.

01:41.756 --> 01:44.244
Oh, you need some snacks
to give to Twilight?

01:44.492 --> 01:46.056
I've got you covered.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.376
Problem solved!

01:56.728 --> 01:59.728
Not exactly.

02:05.893 --> 02:10.890

The Legend say the tea cup poodle is still roaming free to this day!
https://yp1.yayponies.no

02:40.852 --> 02:43.452
I am so excited for this
friendship retreat!

02:43.720 --> 02:45.880
I can't remember the last
time we all got to hang out

02:45.908 --> 02:47.648
without having to
save Equestria!

02:47.936 --> 02:50.048
Well, we are awesome,

02:50.096 --> 02:53.128
but technically we weren't the
last ponies to save Equestria.

02:54.532 --> 02:56.900
I was speaking in
a broader sense!

02:57.212 --> 02:59.096
Are you sure you don't
want to come with us?

02:59.388 --> 03:01.548
Yeah, I have three new
comics to get through.

03:01.668 --> 03:04.536
And I promised Trixie
we'd practice more magic.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.132
It might be better if
the castle was empty

03:07.192 --> 03:08.420
if you know what I mean.

03:09.620 --> 03:12.028
Relax. If
anything breaks,

03:12.056 --> 03:14.132
Starlight will just go back
in time and fix it.

03:17.692 --> 03:18.352
Kidding!

03:19.148 --> 03:21.572
We'll take good care of the
castle while you're gone.

03:21.820 --> 03:23.620
Have fun on your
friendship retreat!

03:24.596 --> 03:27.764
What in Equestria is a
friendship retreat, anyway?

03:28.044 --> 03:30.588
They're gonna bond, share
laughs and if I know them,

03:30.700 --> 03:32.032
they're gonna
sing a song.

03:32.760 --> 03:35.316
We are gonna have so
much more fun than them.

03:36.352 --> 03:37.280
Shhh!

03:39.212 --> 03:42.532
Twilight, wait! Starlight
has something for you!

03:42.920 --> 03:43.420
Huh?

03:45.212 --> 03:48.032
Here, I, um, brought you snacks.

03:48.740 --> 03:51.428
Oh. How thoughtful. Thanks.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.456
We will... not get
hungry on the train.

03:54.660 --> 03:58.236
It was supposed to be tea
cakes, but it's a long story.

03:59.032 --> 04:00.248
Have a great time.

04:00.416 --> 04:01.180
You, too!

04:08.188 --> 04:11.780
OK Trixie, what kind of spells
did you want to work on next?

04:12.084 --> 04:15.128
Well, every
self-respecting magician

04:15.164 --> 04:16.604
has a disappearing act

04:16.640 --> 04:18.308
so maybe we could
start with that?

04:18.650 --> 04:22.020
Hmm. Nothing just disappears
so that's technically

04:22.048 --> 04:25.188
a teleportation spell and
those are pretty hard.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.568
Maybe we should start
with something smaller.

04:27.920 --> 04:31.736
No no no no. The great
and powerful Trixie

04:31.892 --> 04:36.772
goes big or not at all!
Just tell me how you do it.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.676
Well, I've always found
magic is tied to my emotions.

04:41.004 --> 04:44.100
Whatever I'm feeling
fuels whatever I'm doing

04:44.324 --> 04:47.000
and the stronger I'm feeling,
the stronger the magic.

04:47.504 --> 04:51.680
Right. Like when you were
so upset that Cutie Marks

04:51.700 --> 04:53.820
took away your friend, your
magic was strong enough

04:53.852 --> 04:55.460
to enslave an
entire village.

04:57.612 --> 05:00.112
Yup. Thanks for
bringing that up.

05:00.536 --> 05:02.408
See? I'm already learning!

05:02.440 --> 05:03.988
If anypony is going
to teach me

05:04.016 --> 05:05.868
how to do a
disappearing spell...

05:05.952 --> 05:07.088
Teleportation spell.

05:07.532 --> 05:10.740
Whatever. I'm
complimenting you! And me.

05:10.972 --> 05:12.944
We can do this
cause we're amazing

05:12.980 --> 05:14.536
and magic is
friendship and stuff.

05:16.632 --> 05:18.696
I guess we can
give it a whirl.

05:18.968 --> 05:22.084
Now we just need to find
you something to teleport.

05:22.716 --> 05:24.632
Spike? How bout it?

05:24.720 --> 05:25.896
Ha ha.

05:26.392 --> 05:29.632
Let's pick something, I
don't know, not living.

05:30.256 --> 05:33.020
I mean, it won't be as
impressive, but OK.

05:33.308 --> 05:34.992
Teach away, mini Twilight.

05:37.444 --> 05:39.716
Welcome to
Manehattan Escapes!

05:40.616 --> 05:42.172
I'm going to start
with a facial

05:42.200 --> 05:43.752
and then get my
hooves done.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.344
Oh. It's not that
kind of retreat.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.508
Isn't it called
Manehattan Escapes

05:48.736 --> 05:50.056
because it's a deluxe spa

05:50.240 --> 05:51.812
where you can escape
all of your troubles?

05:52.076 --> 05:55.104
Nope. It's because we
get locked in a room

05:55.136 --> 05:56.776
and we have to solve
puzzles and riddles

05:56.796 --> 05:57.948
in order to escape!

06:00.500 --> 06:03.440
The clues will lead you
to a key to get out.

06:03.728 --> 06:05.120
Team building!

06:06.560 --> 06:08.528
Come on, girls.
This could be fun.

06:08.796 --> 06:11.476
"Could be"? Some of the
brightest minds in Equestria

06:11.504 --> 06:12.960
put together
these puzzles!

06:13.224 --> 06:15.512
I'm just happy to
be with all of you.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.140
Me too! I'm not great
at solving riddles,

06:18.200 --> 06:20.232
but I'm super great at
cheering other ponies on

06:20.256 --> 06:25.260
while they do it. GO
US! Oha oha! Woohoo!

06:25.476 --> 06:28.828
Yes, yes woohoo,
but just so we know,

06:29.136 --> 06:31.860
exactly how long will
we be locked in here?

06:32.760 --> 06:36.396
A group of Griffons set the
record for the fastest escape.

06:36.528 --> 06:38.088
It only took them an hour.

06:38.324 --> 06:41.496
Pssh. Griffons barely
like each other!

06:41.630 --> 06:45.088
We're basically the poster
ponies for amazing friendships

06:45.480 --> 06:47.692
so get your quill ready, bub.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.400
You're gonna have to
write down a new record.

06:51.524 --> 06:53.856
If you master this spell
before the girls get back,

06:53.888 --> 06:55.636
you'd be setting
some kind of record.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.524
Challenge accepted.

06:57.650 --> 07:00.768
OK, what you want to do is
concentrate on the object

07:00.800 --> 07:02.284
that you want to teleport.

07:03.128 --> 07:06.328
Yeah, I'm gonna go...
all the way over here.

07:07.256 --> 07:11.892
Concentrate on teleporting,
got it. Doin' the spell!

07:12.072 --> 07:13.500
No Trix, wait. Not just--

07:29.440 --> 07:30.992
Nonononononono!

07:31.150 --> 07:34.176
You made Twilight's
Friendship Map disappear!

07:34.404 --> 07:36.048
Ahem. Teleport.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.136
Really?!

07:37.612 --> 07:40.352
Well, it was behind the apple,
it was bound to happen.

07:40.448 --> 07:43.240
On the plus side, my
magic is getting better.

07:43.372 --> 07:47.104
I made a whole table go poof!
That was pretty impressive.

07:47.220 --> 07:49.936
Trixie, we have to
get that map back.

07:50.044 --> 07:51.488
We'll find it.
No big deal.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.784
Twilight's never going
to trust me to be alone

07:53.816 --> 07:57.108
in this castle again!
What were you thinking?

07:57.564 --> 08:00.108
"Teleport"! Like you told me to!

08:00.240 --> 08:03.484
No! You're supposed to
concentrate on the object!

08:03.548 --> 08:05.160
Not just teleporting!

08:05.688 --> 08:08.648
Well, gee, you probably should
have told me all the steps

08:08.680 --> 08:10.104
before you let me
do the spell.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.656
I TRIED!

08:13.432 --> 08:15.856
I... need a minute.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.960
Hey, are you OK?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.324
I will be, once I cast a
spell to contain my anger

08:29.352 --> 08:30.324
in this bottle.

08:31.136 --> 08:31.752
Wait, what?

08:32.540 --> 08:34.344
Do you see this
storm cloud?

08:34.548 --> 08:36.147
This has never
happened before.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.700
All this magical
energy has to go somewhere

08:38.732 --> 08:41.140
and if I'm not using it
to fight a magical duel

08:41.168 --> 08:44.152
or bend my friends' wills
to obey my every command...

08:44.732 --> 08:46.692
Ha. I remember that.

08:47.456 --> 08:50.664
The point is, I don't know
what my magic's going to do.

08:50.716 --> 08:53.132
So I'm hoping if I
bottle up my anger,

08:53.336 --> 08:56.088
I won't do who-
knows-what to Trixie.

08:56.616 --> 08:58.780
Are you sure that's a good idea?

08:59.132 --> 09:02.488
What choice do I have? I've got
to get that map back

09:02.524 --> 09:04.576
and I don't want
to lose Trixie.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.824
If she knew what I was
thinking right now,

09:06.948 --> 09:08.812
she'd probably never
talk to me again.

09:09.240 --> 09:12.444
OK. You do what
you need to do;

09:12.660 --> 09:14.612
I'll see if I can find the
map somewhere in the castle.

09:26.328 --> 09:27.168
Trixie.

09:27.592 --> 09:30.116
Oh, there you are.
For a minute

09:30.136 --> 09:31.620
I didn't think you
were coming back

09:31.644 --> 09:34.484
and that you might be upset
with me for some weird reason.

09:34.940 --> 09:38.368
But then I remembered
you never get mad at me.

09:42.744 --> 09:45.792
Whoo. Nope. Not
mad at all.

09:46.740 --> 09:49.700
So, the map is probably
in the last place

09:49.716 --> 09:51.960
you were thinking
of. Where was that?

09:52.192 --> 09:56.128
Oooh. Great question. I
wish you'd asked it, like,

09:56.276 --> 09:59.468
right after I did the spell.
I don't remember anymore.

10:02.308 --> 10:05.788
No worries. We'll just
take a walk around town.

10:05.820 --> 10:07.516
Maybe that will
jog your memory.

10:07.888 --> 10:09.952
OK, that sounds
fun. Oooh!

10:10.664 --> 10:11.440
Did you remember?

10:11.636 --> 10:14.808
No. But I did think we could
stop for cinnamon nuts

10:14.848 --> 10:15.848
while we're out!

10:15.992 --> 10:17.980
Cinnamon nuts?!

10:19.512 --> 10:21.280
That's a good idea.

10:21.544 --> 10:24.132
Yes! I've been craving
something sweet

10:24.156 --> 10:27.336
since I couldn't have any
tea cakes this morning.

10:28.232 --> 10:29.088
Whoo!

10:29.300 --> 10:31.228
You got this, Starlight.

10:33.048 --> 10:35.864
Woohoo! Go Twilight,
you can do it!

10:39.268 --> 10:40.236
Woohoo!

10:40.304 --> 10:43.776
Hoo-wee! You solved that
triangle-y thing mighty fast.

10:44.876 --> 10:46.816
Does anypony need
a purple jewel?

10:47.112 --> 10:49.176
Ooh! Plum or boysenberry?

10:49.680 --> 10:52.384
Don't both those
fruits mean "purple"?

10:52.808 --> 10:55.640
Yes, but one's a lovely purple
and one's...well...icky.

10:56.316 --> 10:59.580
Just put the gem in! We're
trying to set a record here!

11:04.512 --> 11:06.732
Yay, we solved another clue!

11:06.864 --> 11:08.804
Cause our friendship is so true!

11:09.240 --> 11:12.832
Yay us! Woohooo!

11:18.388 --> 11:20.944
Oh, hello Fillies,
how can I help you?

11:21.548 --> 11:23.544
Ooh, are those
cinnamon nuts?

11:23.792 --> 11:26.908
Mmm Yes! I got them
from the cart outside.

11:27.076 --> 11:29.192
They're delicious.
Do you want some?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.956
Have you seen a big
table? Magical map on it?

11:31.980 --> 11:33.756
Sometimes glowing
cutie marks shoot out?

11:33.996 --> 11:35.792
Uhh big ta--No. No.

11:36.288 --> 11:39.032
Why in Equestria would
something like that be in here?

11:39.728 --> 11:43.936
Well, I cast a pretty amazing
spell that transported it

11:43.980 --> 11:45.824
to the last place
I was thinking of.

11:46.156 --> 11:48.812
But I might have been thinking
about how I'd treat myself

11:48.832 --> 11:51.200
to a nice brooch instead.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.032
Ah. Well, no huge table here.

11:54.216 --> 11:56.180
Are you still interested
in that brooch?

11:56.544 --> 11:57.216
Sure!

11:57.264 --> 11:57.980
No!

11:59.564 --> 12:01.136
We don't have
time for this!

12:01.300 --> 12:03.592
Twilight and the girls
are gonna be back soon.

12:05.048 --> 12:08.128
But I'm not upset.
What's our next stop?

12:11.360 --> 12:13.140
Nope. I ain't seen it.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.296
Are you sure?

12:14.480 --> 12:17.472
It's really really
important that we find it.

12:17.672 --> 12:22.200
And it might be here because
somepony was craving apples.

12:23.128 --> 12:26.836
I'm still craving them. They'd
go so well with cinnamon nuts!

12:28.176 --> 12:30.560
Them nuts sure
do smell good!

12:31.136 --> 12:33.880
Granny Smith.
Please. The table?

12:35.340 --> 12:37.732
My eyes ain't what
they used to be

12:37.830 --> 12:40.784
but I'd know fer sure if
a big ole table dun appear

12:40.804 --> 12:42.148
out of thin air!

12:49.460 --> 12:50.992
Darn. I could've
have sworn it'd be

12:51.008 --> 12:52.632
at the ice cream parlor,
because it was warm

12:52.656 --> 12:54.456
in the castle and I
thought I wanted ice cream.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.484
Ooh! Maybe we should check
out the Crystal Empire

12:56.516 --> 12:58.344
because Twilight's castle
is made out of crystals

12:58.368 --> 13:00.284
so I totally had
crystals on my mind.

13:02.568 --> 13:05.236
OK. We'd better start moving
if we want to make it

13:05.260 --> 13:06.552
to the Crystal Empire.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.180
Are you OK, Starlight?

13:08.444 --> 13:12.968
Because you seem a little...
what's the word? Uck la la.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.796
Nope. I am great.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.436
Did your saddle
bag just glow?

13:19.836 --> 13:20.396
No.

13:20.664 --> 13:20.944
Gimmee.

13:21.000 --> 13:21.792
No.

13:21.816 --> 13:22.352
Give it here.

13:22.380 --> 13:23.060
No. Don't

13:23.664 --> 13:25.168
CINNAMON NUTS!

13:26.440 --> 13:29.952
I've had a hankerin'
for these all day!

13:30.248 --> 13:33.172
Me too, ever since that
Trixie came by with them.

13:51.752 --> 13:54.956
Um. Why are they
looking at me like that?

14:02.160 --> 14:02.868
Whoa!

14:02.964 --> 14:05.256
You ruined my
tea cakes!

14:05.520 --> 14:06.060
What?!

14:08.376 --> 14:11.556
You just had to give Twilight
those smelly pretzels.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.512
Were they your pretzels?
I don't understand.

14:14.792 --> 14:18.124
YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION WHEN
I'M TRYING TO TEACH YOU!

14:18.256 --> 14:20.924
Starlight, can you
help me? Please!

14:21.300 --> 14:23.240
Twilight, can you
help me please?

14:25.528 --> 14:28.156
I've seen those
symbols over here!

14:29.328 --> 14:30.428
You can do it!

14:32.760 --> 14:33.904
Almost there!

14:34.544 --> 14:36.068
I've got the key!

14:38.960 --> 14:41.284
This is it! I'm
so impressed.

14:41.516 --> 14:43.916
I'm not! I knew
we were the best!

14:44.452 --> 14:45.768
You're the worst!

14:45.972 --> 14:47.128
That seems harsh.

14:47.764 --> 14:50.028
Aaah! Starlight!

14:51.048 --> 14:53.844
I don't know what's
happening! Starlight! Help!

14:56.360 --> 14:58.864
I'm glad Twilight
isn't here to see this.

14:59.196 --> 15:00.552
I wish that Starlight was here

15:00.584 --> 15:02.228
to see how strong
friendships can be

15:02.252 --> 15:04.092
when we trust each
other and work together!

15:04.756 --> 15:06.800
You've all taught
me so much.

That was lovely.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.920
But um, you know
the game isn't over

17:00.944 --> 17:02.568
until you turn that key.

17:04.776 --> 17:05.220
AHH!

17:08.916 --> 17:09.600
Did we do it?

17:11.464 --> 17:15.692
So close. You missed the
griffon record by two seconds.

17:15.988 --> 17:18.584
Probably shouldn't
have sung that song.

17:19.104 --> 17:20.508
AWW NUTS!

17:21.400 --> 17:23.980
AHHHHHHH!

17:24.612 --> 17:25.320
Nuts!

17:30.092 --> 17:33.920
YOU JUST DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO!

17:34.796 --> 17:35.796
Starlight!

17:36.336 --> 17:40.604
And you don't always have
to bring up my dark past!

17:40.852 --> 17:43.084
I didn't know you had
one, Granny Smith!

17:48.520 --> 17:53.056
I just can't believe you
sometimes! You make me so MAD!

17:53.200 --> 17:54.856
I barely even know you!

17:55.096 --> 17:57.764
I don't understand why
you're all so mad at me!

17:58.300 --> 18:00.736
They're not. I am.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.508
You are?

18:06.080 --> 18:10.040
I'm really...
mad at you.

18:10.628 --> 18:12.764
You lost Twilight's
map table;

18:13.040 --> 18:15.612
you make jokes like
it's no big deal.

18:15.976 --> 18:17.616
It's like you
don't even care

18:17.668 --> 18:19.504
you could get me in
a lot of trouble.

18:19.596 --> 18:21.016
If we can't find
that table,

18:21.044 --> 18:23.132
Twilight's never going
to trust me again.

18:23.384 --> 18:24.548
And the worst part is

18:24.660 --> 18:26.968
you didn't even
say you were sorry!

18:27.228 --> 18:32.272
I... I'm sorry. I had no
idea you felt that way.

18:32.436 --> 18:34.156
Yeah. I do.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.976
But to be fair, I don't know
how you could have known.

18:39.548 --> 18:41.788
I did a spell. I
bottled up my anger,

18:41.832 --> 18:45.272
but when the bottle broke,
it infected these three.

18:45.604 --> 18:50.936
I'm really sorry; I used magic
so I wouldn't use magic.

18:51.408 --> 18:53.284
I should have guessed
that would backfire.

18:53.796 --> 18:56.824
Oh, that's all right.
It was a slow day.

18:57.024 --> 19:00.260
Yeah. I was gonna get
my dentures cleaned

19:00.288 --> 19:02.008
before y'all showed up.

19:02.980 --> 19:05.824
Oh, no. My nut cart!

19:09.556 --> 19:11.288
Yay! My nut cart!

19:11.816 --> 19:14.232
Hang on; don't you
work at the spa?

19:15.656 --> 19:20.076
I'm late for my other job!
What, I wear many hats.

19:22.540 --> 19:25.788
Not gonna lie, hearing you
and those random ponies

19:25.808 --> 19:29.840
say all those terrible
things about me wasn't easy.

19:30.172 --> 19:31.400
But I needed to hear it.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.064
Why didn't you just
tell me how you felt?

19:34.296 --> 19:36.420
I didn't want to
lose you as a friend.

19:36.536 --> 19:41.028
Pfft. Come on! It'd take a lot
more than that to lose me.

19:41.332 --> 19:44.368
Our friendship is stronger
than a few angry words.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.532
And a magical
temper tantrum?

19:46.756 --> 19:49.636
Listen, I'd take that
over the boring pony

19:49.648 --> 19:51.336
you were becoming any day.

19:51.752 --> 19:56.156
The Starlight I love is
passionate, lively and yeah,

19:56.212 --> 20:00.000
sometimes angry. Those are
my favorite parts of you.

20:00.236 --> 20:03.944
That and the fact that you
forgive me every time.

20:05.532 --> 20:08.092
I'll forgive you
if you forgive me.

20:08.580 --> 20:09.192
Deal.

20:10.164 --> 20:12.036
I remember what I
was thinking about!

20:15.076 --> 20:16.196
You're kidding me.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.040
There's more to
it than that.

20:18.336 --> 20:21.204
I was thinking about how
glad I am to have met you

20:21.228 --> 20:22.772
and I remembered
our first meeting:

20:23.100 --> 20:25.456
here at the Ponyville Spa.

20:26.084 --> 20:28.008
And now I just have
to teleport it back.

20:28.212 --> 20:29.396
No no no no noooo!

20:34.212 --> 20:38.260
A little to the left.
Now rotate it just a hair.

20:38.312 --> 20:39.876
Hey, girls!
How'd it go?

20:41.780 --> 20:42.628
Nothing.

20:43.044 --> 20:43.720
What?

20:44.424 --> 20:46.648
Let's just say I learned
a friendship lesson

20:46.676 --> 20:47.532
while you were gone.

20:47.732 --> 20:49.124
You've barely graduated

20:49.404 --> 20:53.340
and you're already taking
initiative! Oh. So proud.

20:53.844 --> 20:57.676
We learned about team building
and problem solving--

20:58.072 --> 20:59.752
--and when not to sing songs!

21:00.128 --> 21:01.776
We certainly had
a good time,

21:01.920 --> 21:04.724
but I really was looking
forward to a spa day.

21:04.996 --> 21:09.144
And the Ponyville spa
is still open. Anyone?

21:09.392 --> 21:11.132
Sounds good to me!
I reckon I could use that.
I have a coupon!

21:12.820 --> 21:13.864
We'll meet you there!

21:14.984 --> 21:17.408
Quick. Do you have a spell
that will make the Spa Ponies

21:17.432 --> 21:19.232
forget that the map
table was there?

21:19.496 --> 21:20.792
Haven't you learned anything

21:20.828 --> 21:23.228
about using magic to
solve your problems?

21:23.672 --> 21:28.396
No. If we learn that lesson,
how will we ever have fun?
