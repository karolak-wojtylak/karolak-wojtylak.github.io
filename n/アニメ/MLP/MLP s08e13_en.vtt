WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:03.102
Twilight: Oh. I've been planning
this retreat for weeks

00:03.203 --> 00:04.703
and we're already
ten minutes behind.

00:04.805 --> 00:05.939
Where is that photographer!?

00:06.040 --> 00:08.674
Oh, no, oh no, oh no.
I'm SO SORRY.

00:08.976 --> 00:09.892
Can you forgive me?

00:09.993 --> 00:11.409
I don't expect
you to forgive me.

00:11.812 --> 00:12.711
Forgive me?

00:14.415 --> 00:15.514
Of course.

00:15.716 --> 00:16.300
I'll help you set up your--

00:16.401 --> 00:19.185
Princess Twilight,
thanks SO much for this!

00:19.287 --> 00:22.121
The Canterlot Historical Society
is thrilled to document

00:22.223 --> 00:24.824
the friendship work
your teachers do.

00:24.926 --> 00:27.026
Let me just pretty
you all up!

00:34.702 --> 00:35.501
OW!

00:35.903 --> 00:36.620
Hey!

00:36.721 --> 00:39.138
Don't want a single hair
out of place, do we?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.073
This is for the history books!

00:41.775 --> 00:42.441
Now...

00:48.649 --> 00:50.149
Well, that's that! Bye!

00:50.251 --> 00:51.083
WAIT!

00:51.185 --> 00:52.417
You forgot Starlight!

00:52.519 --> 00:53.986
She needs a picture too!

00:54.623 --> 00:55.256
'Kay.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.290
Now I'll get out of your manes!

00:58.092 --> 00:59.559
I know how busy you are!

01:09.637 --> 01:12.872
Now I have everything I need.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.952
Yes, I know.

02:00.454 --> 02:04.190
We have been planning
this for quite some time.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.293
Oh, thank you, Applejack.

02:08.495 --> 02:12.030
My spell can create a
copy of anypony I desire.

02:12.232 --> 02:16.135
All I need is an image
and a piece of the pony.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.502
Oh, and this.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.073
Why copies, Rarity?

02:21.175 --> 02:23.608
Because Princess
Twilight and her friends

02:23.710 --> 02:25.610
control the Elements
of Harmony.

02:25.712 --> 02:28.380
The most powerful
weapon in ALL Equestria.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.450
Which means YOU...

02:31.536 --> 02:34.619
will, be, able, to,
use, them, too!

02:36.590 --> 02:38.557
And serve.. me!

02:39.761 --> 02:43.362
Together, we will destroy
Twilight Sparkle

02:43.464 --> 02:45.630
and her meddlesome friends!

02:47.334 --> 02:50.502
OF COURSE I HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN STARLIGHT GLIMMER!

02:50.604 --> 02:52.304
She stole my hive.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.373
Turned my subjects against me.

02:54.475 --> 02:58.043
So I'll take her "friends"
away while she watches.

02:58.245 --> 03:00.579
And then... I'll destroy her!

03:04.418 --> 03:06.885
With the Elements
under my control,

03:07.087 --> 03:12.157
I'll build a NEW hive of earth
ponies, unicorns and pegasi.

03:12.259 --> 03:17.028
And I will rule as
Queen ONCE AGAIN!

03:35.582 --> 03:38.617
Hmm. At least our retreat isn't
TOO far behind schedule.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.285
Get ready for fun!

03:40.587 --> 03:42.487
Are we talking FUN fun?

03:42.589 --> 03:44.856
Or learning
pretending to be fun?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.992
Both! We've all been
so busy teaching,

03:47.094 --> 03:49.428
we've hardly had a chance to
hang out with each other.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.464
And I may have scheduled some
friendship activities as well!

03:52.566 --> 03:53.716
Count me in!

03:53.817 --> 03:56.667
We can do friendship trust
falls and pony pyramids...OH!

03:56.770 --> 03:57.803
And hide and seek!

03:57.905 --> 03:58.789
QUICK! FIND ME!

03:58.890 --> 04:03.674
Well, I love the idea of some
quiet time with my best friends.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.477
AH! YOU FOUND ME!

04:06.380 --> 04:09.915
Rarity, why is Applejack
carrying all your stuff?

04:10.117 --> 04:11.450
Oh, that's not mine.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.253
Yes, I used to overpack a tad.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.655
But now it's JUST the
essentials for me.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.923
I'm a simple filly.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.392
Normally I wouldn't
lug so much gear,

04:20.494 --> 04:24.229
but did y'all know this is
Starlight's FIRST time campin'?

04:24.631 --> 04:27.332
I just never really
felt the need to...

04:27.634 --> 04:29.501
hang out in nature.

04:29.603 --> 04:33.272
Home has books, tea,
fewer bugs, a roof...

04:33.474 --> 04:35.740
That attitude right
there is why I brought

04:35.842 --> 04:37.360
the whole kit n' caboodle!

04:37.461 --> 04:41.779
I'm giving Starlight the FULL
Apple family camping experience!

04:45.486 --> 04:47.786
Um, where ARE we camping?

04:47.988 --> 04:50.355
Right next to the elements that
brought us all together

04:50.457 --> 04:51.723
in the first place.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.625
The Tree of Harmony!

04:58.298 --> 04:59.998
LISTEN to your Queen!

05:00.100 --> 05:02.701
We must retrieve The
Elements of Harmony!

05:03.203 --> 05:05.170
Hunting down some
lame Elements?

05:05.272 --> 05:06.872
This is the worst
day EVER!

05:07.508 --> 05:10.041
No. NOW it's the
worst day ever.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.844
Those elements are MINE!

05:13.146 --> 05:14.379
Along with this rock.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.047
Oh, and that twig.

05:16.149 --> 05:20.419
I got all kinds of Elements
right here under my hat.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.353
I'll letcha see
'em for five bits.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.290
Huh. Losers.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.092
Why didn't you
just attack them?

05:27.394 --> 05:29.360
Excuse me?

05:29.462 --> 05:32.197
You were close enough to
pull hairs from their manes.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.233
Why not just take
your revenge then?

05:34.635 --> 05:36.334
They've defeated my army.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.269
I know better than
to strike alone.

05:38.371 --> 05:38.804
I need--

05:38.906 --> 05:39.971
Friends?

05:40.173 --> 05:41.940
SERVANTS.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.209
And the power of
the Elements.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.944
Right.....

05:46.146 --> 05:48.747
So, where are these
Elements of Harmony?

05:49.049 --> 05:51.816
The location of the most
powerful weapon in Equestria

05:51.918 --> 05:54.820
isn't something made
known to just anypony.

05:54.922 --> 05:58.223
I learned they were hidden
somewhere in this forest.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.892
Yeah well, it is a big forest.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.098
Everypony stop!

06:07.000 --> 06:09.334
And smell these roses!

06:10.637 --> 06:11.470
Aaah!

06:12.673 --> 06:14.922
Pinkie: Oh, yeah!
Twilight: All right! Roses! Fun!

06:15.075 --> 06:16.908
Now... let's try and
stay on schedule!

06:18.845 --> 06:20.062
Applejack, darling?

06:20.263 --> 06:22.680
Anything in that wagon
for mane maintenance?

06:24.351 --> 06:25.584
Uh, let's see here.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.152
I got a bandana?

06:27.654 --> 06:30.255
An entire wagon
and no anti friz?

06:30.357 --> 06:31.923
Darling, you're
not even prepared!

06:32.225 --> 06:34.492
I am. For campin'.

06:34.594 --> 06:35.928
How you doin', Starlight?

06:38.431 --> 06:39.231
Great.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.320
Oh, no!

06:44.521 --> 06:47.838
You and your sister fell out
of your nest and got separated?

06:47.941 --> 06:49.408
That's terrible!

06:50.110 --> 06:50.810
Here.

06:51.412 --> 06:54.112
I'm sure your home
isn't TOO far away.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.050
WAH! PINKIE!

06:59.152 --> 07:00.319
If we keep stopping
to have fun,

07:00.420 --> 07:02.887
we're never going to get to the
fun things I've got planned!

07:03.090 --> 07:04.524
Ah! Good point!

07:04.625 --> 07:07.059
LAST ONE TO THE TREE OF
HARMONY IS A PARASPRITE!

07:11.498 --> 07:14.365
I'm so bored!

07:14.467 --> 07:16.568
Are we there yet?

07:16.770 --> 07:17.786
WHERE yet?

07:17.887 --> 07:19.403
We don't even know
where we're going.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.540
The quicker we
search the forest,

07:21.642 --> 07:23.575
the quicker we
find the Elements.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.144
I know where the Elements are.

07:26.346 --> 07:29.214
This uh, here boulder
just told me. I swear.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.319
You tried to fly out of the
nest, but you fell and got lost?

07:37.023 --> 07:38.323
Hope ya like walking!

07:43.096 --> 07:45.398
Come get me when I should care.

07:47.202 --> 07:49.337
Where.  Are.  The others?

07:49.738 --> 07:55.273
Uh, a uh Bugbear in plaid socks
flew down and uh grabbed 'em.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.775
Then disappeared!

07:57.277 --> 07:59.378
Craziest thing I ever did see.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.680
Turn around.

08:01.782 --> 08:02.814
We're going back.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.249
No! Keep searching.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.335
I'll find the others.

08:05.436 --> 08:08.020
We can accomplish more if
we split our resources.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.089
Very well.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.625
You have my permission.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.795
"Permission"?

08:15.896 --> 08:20.264
You need us way more than
we need you, "Your Majesty".

08:20.567 --> 08:22.067
The others are fools.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.968
But with me to lead them,
there's no reason we can't find

08:25.071 --> 08:28.173
the Elements and keep
the power for ourselves!

08:36.416 --> 08:37.582
YOU'RE IT!

08:37.784 --> 08:39.551
Hey, how did you
get ahead of me?

08:39.623 --> 08:40.839
You're fast!

08:41.263 --> 08:41.763
Ugh.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.556
I'm looking for Fluttershy
and Rainbow Dash!

08:46.059 --> 08:47.325
Aren't they back there?

08:47.427 --> 08:48.326
They are?

08:48.428 --> 08:49.011
Sure!

08:49.112 --> 08:50.995
Unless they're already
at the Tree of Harmony.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.832
What is the TREE of Harmony?

08:54.834 --> 08:56.067
Oh, ha ho!

08:56.169 --> 08:58.269
This is one of your
"activities" right?

08:58.371 --> 08:59.371
Like a friendship quiz?

08:59.472 --> 09:01.872
It's the crystal tree that
holds the Elements of Harmony!

09:01.975 --> 09:02.574
BOOM!

09:02.676 --> 09:04.176
[gasp] Where is it?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.277
Bzzzz! It's at the bottom
of the stairs in the ravine

09:06.380 --> 09:08.246
by the Castle of the
Two Sisters!

09:08.348 --> 09:09.481
A double BOOM!

09:09.583 --> 09:10.582
How do you know?

09:10.784 --> 09:11.850
You've SEEN it?

09:12.252 --> 09:13.019
Mm hm!

09:13.220 --> 09:16.787
Honestly Twilight, these
questions are SUPER easy.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.796
Right where you belong.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.864
Oh, dear.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.699
This isn't where I belong.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.303
Oh, Rainbow Dash!

09:31.605 --> 09:33.404
I'm so glad you're here.

09:33.606 --> 09:34.973
I was lost!

09:35.175 --> 09:37.109
Bummer. Later.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.411
What just happened?

09:39.513 --> 09:42.312
[yelling] Fluttershy!

09:42.449 --> 09:45.116
Ugh. Fantastic. First Pinkie
races ahead of us,

09:45.218 --> 09:47.385
and now Fluttershy is lost
somewhere behind us.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.855
My retreat is off
to a <i>great</i> start.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.891
It's not like Fluttershy
to disappear like this.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.459
We'll split up and
search for her.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.127
We can all meet
back at the Tree.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.929
Starlight, take the
navigation gear and--

09:58.031 --> 09:58.797
Go with Rarity? Great!

09:58.898 --> 10:00.864
Rainbow Dash, YOU can
go with Applejack! Heh heh.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.400
I'll find Pinkie Pie.

10:05.338 --> 10:09.141
Bored bored bored.

10:09.843 --> 10:13.711
This is ridiculous! Where
are my other minions?

10:13.813 --> 10:17.715
Probably plotting
to steal <i>my</i> things. Grrr.

10:17.817 --> 10:21.286
They're at a secret party
up in that there tree,

10:21.588 --> 10:26.024
run by a squirrel named er... Jerome.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.493
But uh, you need a
password to get in.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.462
[growl] ENOUGH!

10:33.400 --> 10:36.301
You will GO out there
and find the others.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.036
You will BRING them back here.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.005
And we will STEAL the
Elements of Harmony,

10:40.107 --> 10:43.809
so I can destroy Starlight's
life like she destroyed mine!

10:44.311 --> 10:45.811
<i> Understand?</i>

10:46.313 --> 10:47.112
Uh huh!

10:47.614 --> 10:50.715
The party password is: Rutabaga.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.387
Why don't you fly
up to your <i>nest</i>?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.857
Oh, that's right.
YOU CAN'T.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.864
Oh, Nopony asked <i>you</i>.

11:07.784 --> 11:10.301
I hope you all
freeze this winter.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.210
Hello again, little friend.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.713
I think I may be
walking in circles.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.349
Oh, my!

11:24.651 --> 11:26.585
Where did you learn
that kind of language?

11:27.587 --> 11:29.787
Um. Excuse me.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.995
Finally! You found her!

11:37.097 --> 11:39.497
Me? We're looking
for Fluttershy!

11:39.799 --> 11:40.799
Where's Starlight?

11:41.101 --> 11:43.468
Well, if I knew THAT...

11:46.473 --> 11:47.205
Hey!

11:47.607 --> 11:48.574
THIS is mine!

11:49.376 --> 11:50.476
And this as well.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.512
Oh, and this is ABSOLUTELY mine.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.749
Rarity, what in the hay are ya
gonna do with a fishing rod?

11:58.351 --> 11:59.451
I don't know.

11:59.653 --> 12:00.953
But I WANT it.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.460
Starlight, darling.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.496
Your'e a gloriously bad camper.

12:11.598 --> 12:14.165
And coming from me,
that is saying a lot.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.484
I know.

12:15.785 --> 12:17.702
Want to break it to
Applejack for me?

12:17.904 --> 12:19.272
Who's breakin' what now?

12:20.974 --> 12:21.940
Who are you?

12:22.242 --> 12:23.975
Very funny, Applejack.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.545
Still me under all
this gear, Starlight.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.413
Starlight..?

12:28.515 --> 12:29.548
How about that.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.315
Y'all better come with me.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.218
It's.. dangerous out here!

12:33.320 --> 12:35.287
Applejack darling,
are you all right?

12:35.789 --> 12:37.121
You look a little peaky.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.356
And where's your wagon?

12:38.458 --> 12:40.325
Uh, stolen!

12:40.527 --> 12:42.160
I barely got away!

12:42.262 --> 12:45.363
Follow me and I'll
tell ya ALL about it.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.267
Pinkie!

12:49.369 --> 12:50.301
There you are!

12:50.803 --> 12:51.636
What are you doing?

12:55.642 --> 12:58.510
YOU CALL THAT A POP? UGH!

12:58.912 --> 13:01.046
I thought you were
racing to the retreat!

13:01.548 --> 13:02.232
Please.

13:02.333 --> 13:07.217
Why would I waste my time on a
boring, lame, no-fun retreat?

13:07.420 --> 13:08.053
What..?

13:11.458 --> 13:12.391
Rainbow Dash!

13:12.492 --> 13:14.625
I think something's
wrong with Pinkie.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.227
Not my problem.

13:19.533 --> 13:22.901
And then all we grew SUPER long
manes with ALL kinds of colors

13:23.003 --> 13:25.203
and your castle grew out of the
ground and everypony was like

13:25.305 --> 13:28.007
"WHOA!" And then we sang this
song about Rainbows and--

13:29.009 --> 13:30.775
Fluttershy! What's wrong?

13:32.412 --> 13:35.447
Everycreature is mad at me!

13:36.049 --> 13:39.083
[gasp] What? That can't be right.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.254
Can we hurry this up?

13:43.356 --> 13:44.789
We're on a schedule here.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.091
Twilight, your
schedule can wait!

13:47.293 --> 13:48.927
Fluttershy's upset!

13:49.229 --> 13:51.195
Well, tell her to get over it!

13:51.297 --> 13:52.363
I'll go get the others.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.265
STAY. HERE.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.503
Oh great.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.605
You upset Fluttershy, too?

14:01.007 --> 14:02.324
You know what, Twilight?

14:02.425 --> 14:04.742
Maybe if you weren't so
worried about schedules,

14:04.944 --> 14:07.211
you'd realize <i>you're</i> the
one ruining the retreat

14:07.313 --> 14:08.346
for your friends!

14:08.483 --> 14:13.217
[gasp] Well.. if my friends don't care about
the retreat I planned for them,

14:13.619 --> 14:15.386
maybe they should've
stayed HOME!

14:15.488 --> 14:17.655
CAN'T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG?

14:19.359 --> 14:20.191
Keep it together.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.393
You can do this.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.594
You NEED those imbeciles if your
plan is going to come together.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.397
YOUR plan?

14:29.169 --> 14:30.453
Uh, THE plan.

14:30.654 --> 14:33.638
I'm just trying to do your
bidding, Your Majesty.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.008
Grubsitting you six is nothing
like controlling my hive.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.044
Give me one good reason why I
shouldn't just destroy you all

14:40.146 --> 14:41.246
and start over.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.616
Because <i>I</i> know where The
Elements of Harmony are.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.918
You NEED me.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.196
Mine! Mine!

15:03.470 --> 15:05.737
I'm guessing some kinda curse?

15:05.939 --> 15:07.338
Maybe Poison Joke?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.273
Well, somethin'
sure ain't right.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.476
What are you
plotting back there?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.811
I can HEAR you, you know.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.713
Don't think you're going
to steal my things!

15:17.050 --> 15:17.649
Oof!

15:19.486 --> 15:20.303
Hang on.

15:20.404 --> 15:23.121
I got a shovel we can use to
whack those vines outta the way.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.342
I KNEW IT!

15:26.643 --> 15:28.793
I KNEW YOU WANTED IT
ALL FOR YOURSELVES!

15:28.895 --> 15:30.294
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT!

15:31.097 --> 15:33.064
IT'S MINE! YOU HEAR ME!

15:33.266 --> 15:36.600
ALL MI-I-I-INE!

15:38.771 --> 15:42.874
So there I was, just me
and a.... a bucket of honey!

15:42.976 --> 15:44.509
Yeah, yeah that's the ticket.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.246
Uh. But I- I survived all by
myself in this here forest

15:48.348 --> 15:51.950
for.... 127 hours!

15:52.252 --> 15:53.236
Really?

15:53.337 --> 15:56.121
I can't believe you've never
told us that story before.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.889
She's making a point.
WE GET IT.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.926
You're the GREATEST camper
in the history of Equestria.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.462
Well, I sure don't need
any of that silly stuff

16:04.564 --> 16:06.365
YOU'RE luggin' around.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.601
The things you
gave me are SILLY?

16:10.003 --> 16:11.403
Just look in a mirror!

16:11.504 --> 16:13.704
Guess I shoulda told
ya that before, huh?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.173
Heh heh heh!

16:20.747 --> 16:23.414
Glad I was so
<i>entertaining</i> for you.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.087
I'm going to make sure she
doesn't break a hoof out there

16:29.189 --> 16:32.491
and then you and I are going
to have a serious talk!

16:33.293 --> 16:34.959
FINALLY!

16:35.461 --> 16:37.662
There. That's all of you.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.534
Nopony leaves without
my say so.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.503
Now wait a second.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.370
Weren't you just--

16:48.709 --> 16:52.544
The time for my revenge on
Starlight Glimmer has come!

16:53.046 --> 16:56.948
Let's see if you're telling
the truth about this tree.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.950
Ha ha ha!

17:01.955 --> 17:03.087
Rarity: Starlight!

17:03.189 --> 17:05.323
Oh, please stop running.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.532
Twilight: Of course I care
about Fluttershy!

17:14.834 --> 17:18.136
Then you got a super-weird
way of showing it!

17:18.238 --> 17:20.471
Wh- What in Equestria
is going on here?

17:20.673 --> 17:23.808
Twilight is so
into her "retreat"

17:23.910 --> 17:26.144
that she doesn't even care
if her friends are upset!

17:26.246 --> 17:27.645
She just wants us to STAY.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.847
ON.
SCHEDULE!

17:30.216 --> 17:32.317
Well, I'm SORRY Pinkie!

17:32.419 --> 17:35.753
If I KNEW you thought this was
a "boring lame no fun retreat"

17:35.955 --> 17:38.222
I wouldn't have invited
you in the FIRST PLACE!

17:38.324 --> 17:39.658
I NEVER SAID THAT!

17:40.260 --> 17:41.327
Sorry, y'all.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.895
We woulda been here sooner but
we had to take the long way

17:43.997 --> 17:46.597
after RARITY ran off
with all my stuff!

17:46.699 --> 17:48.867
Wha! I most certainly
did not!

17:49.169 --> 17:51.369
What? You know I
ain't no liar!

17:51.771 --> 17:52.971
Where's all your gear?

17:53.373 --> 17:55.440
Why? So you can LAUGH
at me some more?

17:55.942 --> 17:58.342
Hey hey! We're
all friends here!

17:58.544 --> 17:59.510
FRIENDS?

17:59.812 --> 18:01.979
You left me alone
in the woods!

18:05.718 --> 18:07.685
EVERYPONY, QUIET!

18:09.355 --> 18:10.188
Listen.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.907
We know each other really well.

18:12.008 --> 18:15.525
The great stuff and how to
get on each other's nerves, too.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.095
I wanted a fun trip
with my friends.

18:18.497 --> 18:20.598
But instead, I got carried
away with plans

18:20.700 --> 18:22.167
and ruined everything.

18:22.368 --> 18:25.435
If you want to forget it all and
head home, I won't be offended.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.872
I just want us to stop fighting.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.408
Hey, sorry if I
got carried away

18:30.510 --> 18:32.310
with all that
campin' stuff.

18:32.512 --> 18:33.595
I'm sorry, too.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.179
I should've just told you
I'll never like camping.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.516
Also: I'll never
like camping.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.718
Well, if we're all
being honest...

18:41.020 --> 18:43.421
I can't survive with just
this tiny efashionable

18:43.523 --> 18:44.689
little saddle bag!

18:44.791 --> 18:46.692
I miss my things!

18:47.794 --> 18:50.428
I'm sorry that you thought that
I thought your plan was lame!

18:50.530 --> 18:52.763
Your plans are
the most unlamest!

18:53.565 --> 18:56.467
And I always have fun
when we're all together.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.504
Even if it's learning
<i>pretending</i> to be fun.

18:59.706 --> 19:03.174
So... does that mean you still
want to have the retreat?

19:03.376 --> 19:04.275
YES!

19:04.477 --> 19:07.578
If... everypony likes me again.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.850
Let's get to that Tree!

19:12.952 --> 19:15.386
I have the whole campsite
set up and ready!

19:18.892 --> 19:21.592
Ugh. What's this garbage?

19:21.994 --> 19:24.395
Badger installation art.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.581
Ya see...

19:25.682 --> 19:28.466
JUST. RETRIEVE.
THE ELEMENTS!

19:40.813 --> 19:44.081
Once we get the power of
the Elements, no creature,

19:44.183 --> 19:47.151
not even "Her Majesty"
can tell us what to do.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.487
Just follow my lead, got it?

19:53.859 --> 19:56.060
Oooooh! That one's mine!

19:58.398 --> 20:01.032
Oops. I'd say
sorry, but I'm not.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.134
Stop it, fools!

20:05.071 --> 20:07.471
We need the elements
to take out Chrysalis!

20:08.408 --> 20:09.840
HOW DARE YOU!

20:10.042 --> 20:11.842
I CREATED YOU!

20:40.039 --> 20:41.105
Imbeciles!

20:41.307 --> 20:43.641
You ruined everything........!

20:48.547 --> 20:51.015
Servants always
fail you in the end.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.351
Just wait, Starlight.

20:53.853 --> 20:57.555
I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE!

20:58.992 --> 21:01.559
[gasp] Are you kidding me?

21:06.132 --> 21:07.064
This was.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.967
The worst. Day. Ever!

21:13.106 --> 21:14.256
Come on, everypony.

21:14.457 --> 21:16.407
We can fix this
campsite in no time.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.343
Spoken like a true camper.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.978
Eh, don't push it.

21:22.065 --> 21:24.749
You know, if we can
survive a day like this,

21:25.151 --> 21:27.351
I think our friendship is
strong enough to handle

21:27.453 --> 21:29.553
anything the world
can throw at us.
