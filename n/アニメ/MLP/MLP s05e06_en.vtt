00:09.873 --> 00:11.364
Aren't you glad
y'all came with me

00:11.385 --> 00:14.564
to see Applejack compete
in the Appleoosa Rodeo?

00:14.783 --> 00:15.625
Totally!

00:15.743 --> 00:17.898
This place is a
Cutie Mark gold mine!

00:17.991 --> 00:19.372
There's barrel racing...

00:21.776 --> 00:23.120
Roping contests...

00:23.776 --> 00:25.044
Rodeo clownin'...

00:26.008 --> 00:27.288
Steeplechase...

00:28.640 --> 00:30.492
If we can get into
some of these events,

00:30.703 --> 00:33.313
we could all three walk off
the train back in Ponyville

00:33.334 --> 00:35.894
with brand spankin'
new Cutie Marks!

00:36.181 --> 00:38.307
Wouldn't a barrel
look good here?

00:38.631 --> 00:40.016
I want a lasso!

00:40.471 --> 00:41.452
I don't know.

00:41.730 --> 00:45.115
All these events look a
little, well, dangerous.

00:45.275 --> 00:46.905
No risk, no reward.

00:47.174 --> 00:49.532
<i> All right,</i>
<i> everypony listen up!</i>

00:49.877 --> 00:52.842
We need a big presence
at this here rodeo,

00:52.863 --> 00:54.913
so make yourself plenty seen!

00:55.098 --> 00:59.288
I want that low-down varmint
to know we mean business!

00:59.545 --> 01:01.410
I hope nothing
bad is going on.

01:01.658 --> 01:04.985
A Cutie-Mark-a-palooza
and a low-down varmint?

01:05.267 --> 01:08.673
This is shapin' up to be the
most exciting rodeo ever!

01:08.821 --> 01:10.324
Yeah! Come on!

01:23.851 --> 01:25.784
Regular subtitles by YayPonies
We have Muffins!
http://main.yayponies.eu

02:09.296 --> 02:10.960
Woohoo!

02:11.031 --> 02:12.046
Yeehaw!

02:12.130 --> 02:13.233
That's my cousin!

02:13.334 --> 02:14.597
Go Applejack go!

02:14.900 --> 02:17.987
Phew! It's been a dog's age
since I got to compete.

02:18.113 --> 02:20.080
All the rodeos 'round
Ponyville have closed down

02:20.105 --> 02:20.791
for some reason.

02:20.955 --> 02:23.861
Well, I guess having injured
kinfolk in Appleoosa

02:23.882 --> 02:25.671
sure paid off then, huh cuz?

02:25.840 --> 02:28.458
Just doin' my best to fill
your horseshoes, Braeburn.

02:28.610 --> 02:31.086
Keep tossin' like that
and I'll be out of a job!

02:31.427 --> 02:32.631
Ow-ow.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.075
Ooh. Sorry.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.006
Say, where's my sister
and her friends?

02:37.456 --> 02:39.806
Uh-oh, gee I, uh...

02:40.092 --> 02:42.218
I guess I got so caught up
watching you that I--

02:42.235 --> 02:44.189
You said you'd keep an
eye on those fillies!

02:44.349 --> 02:46.901
How am I supposed to focus on
practicing if you're not gonna--

02:46.926 --> 02:47.869
There they are!

02:48.576 --> 02:49.978
Right where I
left 'em.

02:52.353 --> 02:53.717
Aw, don't be mad.

02:54.467 --> 02:56.058
Ouch.

02:56.181 --> 02:57.562
My foreleg!

02:57.726 --> 02:59.633
Hurts so much.

03:02.273 --> 03:04.669
Y'all can't go running
off like that, y'hear?

03:04.950 --> 03:07.498
Backstage at a rodeo
ain't no kinda playground.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.789
Sorry, Applejack. We
won't wander off again.

03:11.528 --> 03:14.008
But, uh, speakin' of the rodeo,

03:14.378 --> 03:16.496
what would you say about
me and the Crusaders

03:16.630 --> 03:20.686
maybe competin' in one teensy
weensy little event or three?

03:20.854 --> 03:22.071
Look out!

03:31.402 --> 03:32.917
What the hay just happened?

03:33.637 --> 03:34.829
You fillies all right?

03:35.187 --> 03:35.936
Uh-huh.

03:36.357 --> 03:37.966
Sugar and Saltlicks!

03:38.669 --> 03:40.058
Well, I'll be...

03:41.027 --> 03:42.134
What is it, Sheriff?

03:45.865 --> 03:47.162
Is it him?

03:47.684 --> 03:49.713
Ain't no doubt.

03:50.311 --> 03:52.248
It's Trouble Shoes.

04:05.810 --> 04:08.400
Is it true?
Is Trouble Shoes here?

04:08.800 --> 04:12.113
You ain't gonna shut down
the rodeo, are ya?

04:12.543 --> 04:16.728
All right now, I called for
a meetin', not a mob scene.

04:18.741 --> 04:22.496
Now as many of you know, the
Equestria rodeo circuit

04:22.517 --> 04:26.825
has been plagued by the dirty
dealings of a notorious outlaw.

04:27.402 --> 04:30.513
He knocked barrels every which
way at the Hoof City Rodeo!

04:30.715 --> 04:32.572
Nearly crushed my Aunt Bay Mare!

04:32.762 --> 04:33.722
That's nothin'!

04:33.835 --> 04:37.427
He sabotaged the steer
pen at Pinto Creek Rodeo,

04:37.692 --> 04:39.688
settin' off such a stampede

04:39.709 --> 04:42.008
they cancelled the
whole dadgum thing!

04:42.858 --> 04:44.130
Now, Now.

04:44.155 --> 04:46.778
It's true, we had an
incident this mornin'

04:46.791 --> 04:48.993
at our own Appleoosa rodeo.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.096
Hay bale stack came
down pretty near on top

04:52.117 --> 04:53.621
of three little fillies.

04:53.873 --> 04:56.981
I examined them
hoofprints myself, and...

04:57.560 --> 04:59.928
It was Trouble Shoes, all right.

05:01.503 --> 05:04.509
I reckon I oughta
cancel this rodeo

05:04.526 --> 05:06.357
like all the others done...

05:07.065 --> 05:09.722
But daghoofit, this
has gone far enough!

05:09.898 --> 05:11.717
We'll double the patrols!

05:11.869 --> 05:14.425
This rodeo will go on!

05:14.698 --> 05:18.000
Appleoosa ain't
gonna be intimidated!

05:20.694 --> 05:21.654
Glad that's settled.

05:21.995 --> 05:26.762
So, uh, Applejack, about me and
my pals competin' in the rodeo.

05:29.431 --> 05:32.235
Don't send us home! It's not fair!

05:32.812 --> 05:34.353
Now quit your
belly-aching.

05:34.652 --> 05:37.915
I can't have y'all around here
with some outlaw on the loose.

05:38.757 --> 05:41.995
Aw, maybe I oughta call
it quits and go home too.

05:42.328 --> 05:43.646
No, you can't!

05:43.970 --> 05:47.658
This rodeo is important to
Appleoosa and with you in there,

05:47.806 --> 05:49.600
we got a real shot at winnin'.

05:49.941 --> 05:52.058
Come on, now, you head
on back to practice

05:52.071 --> 05:53.869
and don't worry none
about these three.

05:54.058 --> 05:55.717
I won't let 'em
outta my sight.

05:59.962 --> 06:00.812
Ya hear?

06:01.090 --> 06:03.578
Y'all ain't leavin' my sight.

06:19.431 --> 06:21.637
I thought we weren't
going to wander off again.

06:22.526 --> 06:23.633
This ain't wandering.

06:23.722 --> 06:26.846
We know exactly where we're
headed: to find Trouble Shoes.

06:27.157 --> 06:29.364
But isn't he a
dangerous criminal?

06:29.696 --> 06:32.416
We only need to find him; we
don't need to capture him.

06:32.821 --> 06:34.168
The sheriff can handle that.

06:34.374 --> 06:37.688
And once he's in jail, we'll
be competing, and then it's...

06:37.747 --> 06:39.229
...Cutie Mark city!

06:43.882 --> 06:45.995
Worst idea ever.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.473
It's another giant hoofprint!

06:59.701 --> 07:02.707
Do either of you have
any idea where we are?

07:07.936 --> 07:11.242
Uh, maybe we should head
back and try again later.

07:11.427 --> 07:13.760
Come on, before
we lose the trail!

07:26.336 --> 07:28.825
Come on, we've
gone far enough!

07:29.090 --> 07:30.240
It's time to
go back!

07:30.585 --> 07:32.850
The rain is only getting
worse, Apple Bloom.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.328
Let's come
back tomorrow.

07:36.526 --> 07:37.675
Maybe y'all are right.

07:38.150 --> 07:39.616
So how do we get back?

07:40.677 --> 07:42.648
You mean you
don't know?

07:48.846 --> 07:49.903
Good job, y'all.

07:50.130 --> 07:52.589
I know they need lots of
mud for the rodeo tomorrow,

07:52.749 --> 07:55.368
but I wish they woulda warned
us about this rainstorm.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.265
Braeburn?

07:59.035 --> 08:00.223
Where are the girls?

08:00.985 --> 08:02.589
Heh heh.

08:03.296 --> 08:04.463
WHAT?

08:12.791 --> 08:14.488
Fished. My. Wish.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.829
Gol-dang nab it!

08:19.317 --> 08:21.204
Sheriff Silverstar!
You gotta help!

08:21.410 --> 08:22.383
My sister's gone!

08:22.488 --> 08:23.612
And her friends, too!

08:23.852 --> 08:26.298
I've searched and searched
but no sign of 'em anywhere.

08:26.694 --> 08:28.218
It must've been
Trouble Shoes!

08:28.484 --> 08:30.475
Now hold on there.

08:30.570 --> 08:33.600
Trouble Shoes done a lot
of bad things in his day,

08:33.740 --> 08:35.141
but nothin' like that.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.237
You really want to
take that chance?

08:39.288 --> 08:40.471
Come on, y'all!

08:40.623 --> 08:41.600
Let's ride!

08:44.357 --> 08:46.951
You sure about
this, Scootaloo?

08:47.220 --> 08:50.181
I thought I was,
but now I'm not.

08:51.014 --> 08:54.690
So I pretty much got us
completely and totally lost.

08:54.997 --> 08:57.313
How could this
get any worse?

09:05.448 --> 09:07.010
We gotta get out
of this rain.

09:07.140 --> 09:09.524
There's no tellin' how
long this storm could last.

09:09.907 --> 09:10.816
Look!

09:12.210 --> 09:13.296
It looks abandoned.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.890
Let's go see if we can find
some blankets or somethin'.

09:45.103 --> 09:46.665
Ow!

09:46.783 --> 09:49.153
Whoa!

09:58.568 --> 09:59.431
Hello?

10:00.707 --> 10:01.667
You all right?

10:02.736 --> 10:03.974
Surely.

10:04.252 --> 10:05.591
We didn't mean no harm.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.360
We just came in to
get out of the rain.

10:07.797 --> 10:10.189
Had some hot cider
cooking in the kitchen.

10:10.408 --> 10:11.797
Doubt it survived.

10:14.732 --> 10:16.665
I ain't gonna rise
to greet y'all.

10:16.810 --> 10:18.943
Awfully rude I reckon,
but as you can see

10:18.968 --> 10:20.555
I'm the fresh casualty of an

10:20.572 --> 10:23.195
unusually unfortunate
circumstance.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.515
My lot in life, I s'pose.

10:25.882 --> 10:26.597
Are you...

10:27.090 --> 10:28.408
Trouble Shoes?

10:28.614 --> 10:29.890
That's me.

10:30.656 --> 10:32.277
Wh-what are you doing?

10:32.480 --> 10:33.861
I'm gonna unwrap him.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.301
You can't do that.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.743
That's Trouble Shoes!

10:37.904 --> 10:39.804
Aw, he don't seem so bad.

10:46.140 --> 10:48.046
A'course guests would arrive

10:48.063 --> 10:50.269
while I ain't got
no pie to offer.

10:50.336 --> 10:54.143
Score s'more misfortune
points for ol' Trouble Shoes.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.837
Whoa!

11:05.701 --> 11:06.627
Typical.

11:06.846 --> 11:08.829
Bad luck never rests.

11:09.381 --> 11:10.745
You sure that's bad luck?

11:10.993 --> 11:14.543
Seems like maybe you're
just a little, um...

11:14.791 --> 11:15.503
klutzy?

11:16.021 --> 11:17.435
Tell that to the flank!

11:17.675 --> 11:19.208
Upside down horseshoe.

11:19.381 --> 11:20.488
Bad luck.

11:20.955 --> 11:23.924
Follows me wherever I go
like sour on old milk.

11:24.429 --> 11:26.732
Y'all best vamoose a'fore
my bad luck rubs off

11:26.757 --> 11:27.760
and sticks to y'all.

11:27.844 --> 11:28.892
Get along.

11:29.204 --> 11:30.016
Skedaddle.

11:31.831 --> 11:33.044
Amskray!

11:33.860 --> 11:37.473
Um...we don't really know
the way back to Appleoosa.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.701
But a'course I do.

11:40.063 --> 11:42.656
Wouldn't ya know
it, my lucky day.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.877
It's actually kinda sweet of
him to help us out like this.

11:48.092 --> 11:48.829
I know.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.322
What do we do if he takes
us back to Appleoosa

11:51.343 --> 11:52.901
and the Sheriff arrests him?

11:53.141 --> 11:54.640
If I get a Cutie Mark for that,

11:54.720 --> 11:56.715
I'll feel guilty
every time I see it.

11:58.614 --> 12:01.978
Say there, Trouble Shoes, you
might not want to take us

12:02.134 --> 12:03.966
all the way back to Appleoosa.

12:04.105 --> 12:06.202
The Sheriff sorta has
it in his mind that

12:06.286 --> 12:08.875
you're a no good outlaw lookin'
to shut down the rodeo.

12:09.490 --> 12:11.254
My kinda luck he'd think that.

12:11.713 --> 12:12.349
But...

12:12.597 --> 12:13.507
is it true?

12:14.282 --> 12:16.210
Y'all like stories?

12:16.442 --> 12:17.208
Mm hm.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.090
Just my luck.

12:19.431 --> 12:21.162
I was hopin' you'd say no.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.593
<i> When I was a colt,</i>

12:24.669 --> 12:27.776
<i> I wanted to be a rodeo</i>
<i> star somethin' fierce,</i>

12:28.092 --> 12:30.467
<i> but I just didn't seem</i>
<i> to have a knack for it.</i>

12:32.223 --> 12:33.132
Whoa!

12:39.073 --> 12:40.261
Oh!

12:41.578 --> 12:43.806
<i>I practiced and practiced and...</i>

12:44.101 --> 12:45.397
Whoa!

12:45.898 --> 12:48.218
<i> ...and finally I</i>
<i> wrangled up the guts</i>

12:48.315 --> 12:50.408
<i> to audition for</i>
<i> rodeo school.</i>

12:50.623 --> 12:52.042
<i>Right in middle of that tryout,</i>

12:52.300 --> 12:54.526
<i> I knew I was doin'</i>
<i> what I was meant to.</i>

12:54.870 --> 12:56.349
<i> And wouldn't ya know it?</i>

12:56.543 --> 12:59.144
<i> In a flash comes</i>
<i> this here Cutie Mark.</i>

13:08.221 --> 13:11.356
<i> I can still remember</i>
<i> them judges laughin'.</i>

13:11.410 --> 13:13.911
<i> I didn't even finish my</i>
<i> routine 'cause right then</i>

13:13.936 --> 13:16.400
<i> I knew bad luck was my fate.</i>

13:17.688 --> 13:20.720
<i> That fire for rodeo'in</i>
<i> never did leave me, though.</i>

13:21.002 --> 13:22.597
<i> I couldn't keep away from 'em.</i>

13:24.227 --> 13:27.452
<i> So I'd sneak down and have a</i>
<i> look and wouldn't ya know it,</i>

13:29.957 --> 13:32.202
<i> bad luck would strike again.</i>

13:33.540 --> 13:36.282
<i> Just my lot in life, I reckon.</i>

13:37.153 --> 13:38.703
Poor Trouble Shoes.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.576
I can't believe
those mean judges

13:40.597 --> 13:42.122
would laugh at
him like that.

13:42.357 --> 13:43.292
Don't ya see?

13:43.469 --> 13:45.187
They weren't
laughing at him;

13:45.376 --> 13:47.082
they were just
enjoyin' the show!

13:47.292 --> 13:48.534
What are you saying?

13:48.682 --> 13:49.275
Think about it.

13:49.452 --> 13:53.103
If we saw a rodeo clown doin'
what he did back in that shack,

13:53.260 --> 13:55.280
we'd think he was the greatest!

13:55.532 --> 13:56.610
You're right!

13:56.842 --> 14:00.168
He could still be in rodeos,
just not the way he thought.

14:00.374 --> 14:03.503
So he's been looking at his
Cutie Mark wrong the whole time!

14:03.633 --> 14:05.313
It's not bad luck, it's--

14:05.334 --> 14:06.126
Gotcha!

14:09.115 --> 14:10.934
Just my luck.

14:11.435 --> 14:15.178
Trouble Shoes, you're under
arrest for vandalizin'

14:15.195 --> 14:17.128
the property and peace of mind

14:17.145 --> 14:20.189
of the good, rodeo-lovin'
ponies of Equestria,

14:20.404 --> 14:25.178
not to mention fillynappin'
and generalized mayhem.

14:25.393 --> 14:25.949
Wait!

14:26.155 --> 14:28.341
Braeburn, get these
fillies someplace safe.

14:28.631 --> 14:29.600
Wait! No!

14:29.755 --> 14:30.968
Listen, Applejack!

14:31.334 --> 14:32.724
No!

14:38.922 --> 14:40.711
<i> But Trouble Shoes isn't the menace</i>

14:40.732 --> 14:42.210
everypony thinks!

14:42.336 --> 14:44.147
Sakes alive,
what's with you?

14:44.471 --> 14:47.629
Why in tarnation would you want
me to help get him out of jail

14:47.764 --> 14:50.088
when he's the one who ran
off with y'all to begin with?

14:51.014 --> 14:52.454
Now if y'all excuse me,

14:52.602 --> 14:55.915
I'm off to win the Appleoosa
Rodeo Hay Bale Monster Stack!

14:56.126 --> 14:57.633
Um... Applejack?

15:04.046 --> 15:07.023
Well, at least
I get me a view

15:07.044 --> 15:10.008
of one small corner
of the rodeo.

15:11.915 --> 15:13.006
Figures.

15:13.751 --> 15:18.467
Aw, come on now, Trouble Shoes,
I'm runnin' out of mattresses!

15:35.591 --> 15:36.505
Come on, Sheriff,

15:36.522 --> 15:38.842
you're about to miss the
Hay Bale Monster Stack!

15:39.246 --> 15:41.343
Jiminy! That startin' already?

15:45.898 --> 15:49.111
Let's go, Trouble Shoes;
this here's a jailbreak!

15:49.406 --> 15:50.711
Ain't no need.

15:51.006 --> 15:54.391
Can hear the rodeo just
fine from this vantage.

15:54.627 --> 15:56.875
But we've got a plan to
help you live your dream!

15:57.216 --> 15:59.705
Listen, y'all, I'm
a known criminal.

15:59.983 --> 16:02.370
How you proposin' on
gettin' me into a rodeo?

16:12.261 --> 16:14.206
Woohoo!
You can do it!
Go Applejack!

16:14.661 --> 16:17.637
Well? How do I look?

16:25.642 --> 16:27.625
Come on, now,
stack them bales!

16:27.667 --> 16:28.985
Woohoo!

16:36.366 --> 16:37.233
Whoa!

16:46.938 --> 16:48.063
That's my sister!

16:55.995 --> 16:58.084
OK now Trouble
Shoes. You're on!

16:58.197 --> 16:59.452
Say what?

16:59.730 --> 17:03.671
I may be dressed like one,
but I ain't no rodeo clown.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.061
You got your Cutie Mark
all wrong, Trouble Shoes.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.981
You were born to entertain!

17:09.313 --> 17:11.966
You got a gift for makin'
folks laugh, don't you?

17:12.265 --> 17:14.741
But my Cutie Mark's an
upside down horseshoe.

17:15.014 --> 17:16.724
And that means bad luck!

17:16.976 --> 17:18.854
That all depends on
how you look at it.

17:19.187 --> 17:21.600
You always wanted to be a
part of the rodeo, right?

17:22.555 --> 17:24.164
Well, now's your chance.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.431
Go on!

17:37.974 --> 17:38.677
Whoa!

17:38.804 --> 17:39.301
Oof!

17:47.570 --> 17:48.585
There y'all are.

17:48.724 --> 17:50.568
How 'bout your
big sis, huh?

17:53.149 --> 17:54.206
Yeah, way to go.

17:57.157 --> 17:59.524
Since when are y'all
so into rodeo clowns?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.997
Just leave me be, Cutie Mark.

18:23.532 --> 18:26.315
I aim to clear that there hoop.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.035
Come on now!

18:55.962 --> 18:58.454
That's the best rodeo
clown I ever seen!

18:58.585 --> 18:59.338
Ha ha ha!

19:16.421 --> 19:18.244
Trouble Shoes!

19:18.627 --> 19:19.524
What the hay?

19:19.768 --> 19:21.410
He escaped from
jail!

19:21.549 --> 19:23.924
Ruinin' another
rodeo!

19:24.113 --> 19:25.254
Let's get 'im!

19:27.705 --> 19:28.618
Wait, y'all!

19:28.711 --> 19:30.374
He ain't what you think he is!

19:30.543 --> 19:32.151
Stand aside, young 'uns.

19:32.341 --> 19:34.635
This one's goin'
back to jail.

19:34.888 --> 19:37.595
But he never wanted
to ruin any rodeos!

19:37.675 --> 19:39.326
Those were just bad accidents.

19:39.376 --> 19:41.515
Sweetie Belle, what're
you talkin' about?

19:41.768 --> 19:44.315
Trouble Shoes has a gift
for making ponies laugh.

19:44.593 --> 19:47.254
He's maybe the best
rodeo clown I ever seen.

19:47.562 --> 19:50.328
That's true, he
is awful funny.

19:50.610 --> 19:52.218
He thought his Cutie
Mark was tellin' him

19:52.235 --> 19:53.869
to keep away from rodeos,

19:54.025 --> 19:57.023
but deep inside he knew that's
where he was meant to be.

19:57.549 --> 19:58.867
He just didn't
know how to do it.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.134
What she says is true.

20:04.311 --> 20:07.507
This here, entertainin'
y'all with my klutzin',

20:07.717 --> 20:09.949
that's what I'm
s'posed to be doin'.

20:10.294 --> 20:11.553
I know it now.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.442
I didn't mean no harm, honest!

20:14.572 --> 20:17.747
I just ain't never loved nothin'
like I love the rodeo.

20:18.176 --> 20:22.901
So I kept on sneakin' back and
makin' a big ol' mess a' things.

20:23.157 --> 20:27.018
Turns out I was just lookin'
at my Cutie Mark all wrong.

20:27.726 --> 20:32.160
That may be so, Trouble Shoes,
but you still gotta face charges

20:32.185 --> 20:33.966
for the problems you caused.

20:34.088 --> 20:38.067
If I done wrong, I'll see to
it that I take my medicine

20:38.088 --> 20:39.667
and square my accounts.

20:39.970 --> 20:43.381
Truth be told, we could
understand all the trouble

20:43.406 --> 20:44.720
with the rodeos.

20:45.086 --> 20:48.126
But why'd ya have to run off
with these here littl'uns

20:48.143 --> 20:49.094
last night?

20:49.380 --> 20:51.865
Uh... yeah, about that...

20:58.581 --> 21:00.905
You really want us to clean
up all this mess

21:00.981 --> 21:02.277
Trouble Shoes made?

21:02.463 --> 21:04.421
Maybe it'll teach you
not to go wanderin' off

21:04.467 --> 21:05.844
after I say not to.

21:06.846 --> 21:09.633
Ain't it bad enough that you
get to go back to Ponyville

21:09.654 --> 21:12.341
with a shiny trophy and
all we're bringin' back

21:12.366 --> 21:14.614
is these same old
blank flanks?

21:14.981 --> 21:17.722
Y'all helped Trouble Shoes
realize what his Cutie Mark

21:17.743 --> 21:18.581
really means.

21:19.031 --> 21:21.764
Ain't that a nice feeling
you can take back with ya?

21:22.517 --> 21:24.564
I guess we did make
things a little better.

21:25.044 --> 21:26.640
Does feel kinda nice.

21:26.867 --> 21:28.787
So, we can stop now?

21:28.985 --> 21:30.345
Nope.
