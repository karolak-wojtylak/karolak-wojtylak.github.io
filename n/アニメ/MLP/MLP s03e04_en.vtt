WEBVTT

00:07.885 --> 00:09.700
Oh, what to wear?
What to wear?

00:10.588 --> 00:12.074
Oh, what to wear?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.280
Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom.

00:13.445 --> 00:15.468
It's not like it's
the Harvest Day Parade.

00:15.474 --> 00:17.222
We're just going
to the train station.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.594
Oh, too casual.

00:21.182 --> 00:22.302
Too summery.

00:22.925 --> 00:24.971
Your cousin isn't gonna care
what you're wearing.

00:25.131 --> 00:26.690
Just pick something.

00:27.577 --> 00:29.200
This is my first time
meeting her.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.177
And she's from Manehattan.

00:31.845 --> 00:33.417
I want to make
a good impression.

00:33.708 --> 00:35.160
You know what would make
a good impression?

00:35.297 --> 00:35.720
What?

00:36.245 --> 00:38.011
Being on time to pick her up!

00:39.651 --> 00:40.142
Ah...

00:43.805 --> 00:46.091
You got nothing to worry about,
sugar cube.

00:46.388 --> 00:47.731
Y'all are gonna
get along great.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.611
You already have
something in common.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.005
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

00:51.605 --> 00:53.245
Neither of you have
your Cutie Mark.

00:54.091 --> 00:57.445
What?! How could you forget to
tell me something like that?

00:57.914 --> 01:00.628
- Well, I--
- Oh, this changes everything.

01:01.022 --> 01:02.531
Meet you at
the train station.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.531
I gotta tell Sweetie Belle
and Scootaloo.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.674
You know your cousin
is supposed to sleep in here!

01:10.929 --> 01:15.929

For distribution on grayjeager.blogspot.com

01:53.740 --> 01:55.554
You really think
she'll want to join?

01:55.560 --> 01:57.508
She doesn't have
her Cutie Mark.

01:57.611 --> 02:00.365
Of course she'll want to join
the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.491
I'm just so excited
I could burst.

02:04.142 --> 02:05.771
Is that the train
from Manehattan?

02:05.777 --> 02:05.988
Yep.

02:10.862 --> 02:13.485
That's her! Oh, wait,
no, no, that's not her.

02:13.828 --> 02:15.160
Oh, wait. No, that's her.

02:15.548 --> 02:17.942
Um, no. Wait.

02:18.148 --> 02:20.485
That's not her either.

02:20.651 --> 02:24.514
Apple Bloom, you've never
met Babs Seed, remember?

02:24.520 --> 02:26.548
Oh, heh-heh, yeah.

02:27.217 --> 02:28.380
Ah, that's her.

02:30.057 --> 02:31.428
Babs! Babs!

02:31.445 --> 02:33.462
It's me, your cousin,
Apple Bloom.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.771
And this is Sweetie Belle.
And this is Scootaloo.

02:35.868 --> 02:38.691
And we are so, so,
so glad you're here.

02:39.005 --> 02:40.194
Thanks, I'm happy to--

02:40.217 --> 02:42.165
This is going to be
the best week of your life!

02:42.188 --> 02:43.410
Sure hope it's gonna be--

02:43.420 --> 02:45.520
Seriously, we are
gonna have a blast.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.817
The Summer Harvest Parade
is going on while you're here.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.262
We get to ride in a float.

02:52.370 --> 02:54.280
Really? I've never been
on a float before.

02:54.354 --> 02:56.960
And we've got a really big
surprise for you.

02:56.982 --> 02:59.754
Yeah. Uh, a surprise?

03:00.451 --> 03:02.131
I give you...

03:02.554 --> 03:05.097
...the Cutie Mark Crusaders
Clubhouse.

03:06.817 --> 03:08.462
The Cutie Mark Crusaders?

03:08.588 --> 03:11.565
A club devoted to helping ponies
get their Cutie Marks.

03:15.491 --> 03:16.542
We're its founding members.

03:16.577 --> 03:19.228
Technically,
we're its only members.

03:19.268 --> 03:20.897
But we're always
looking to expand

03:20.931 --> 03:22.897
and you seem like
the perfect candidate.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.205
I do?

03:24.308 --> 03:25.194
Well, yeah.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.731
Since you don't have
a Cutie Mark and all.

03:27.514 --> 03:30.320
Oh. Yeah. That.

03:30.651 --> 03:32.640
Allow me to show you just
some of the highlights

03:32.668 --> 03:35.131
of our clubhouse, should
you choose to join us.

03:41.702 --> 03:43.285
This is where
we do our roll call.

03:43.314 --> 03:43.891
Huh.

03:48.034 --> 03:49.611
This is where
we eat our lunch.

03:54.177 --> 03:57.120
Sometimes we stand here
and think up great ideas.

04:00.571 --> 04:01.822
Yeah. Uh...

04:04.005 --> 04:06.051
Uh, could you excuse us
for a moment?

04:06.474 --> 04:07.194
Sure.

04:08.434 --> 04:10.148
Thought she'd be
more impressed.

04:10.388 --> 04:11.605
She's from Manehattan.

04:11.822 --> 04:14.891
If we want to impress her
we need to really wow her.

04:16.182 --> 04:17.565
Hmm...

04:17.822 --> 04:19.085
Ah! The float.

04:19.130 --> 04:21.737
She can ride with us on our
Summer Harvest Parade float.

04:21.817 --> 04:23.302
That's perfect.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.062
This really is a good spot
for thinking up great ideas.

04:26.605 --> 04:27.771
Mm-hm.

04:29.754 --> 04:30.982
Here it is.

04:31.177 --> 04:33.702
The official Cutie Mark
Crusaders float

04:33.720 --> 04:36.514
for the Summer
Harvest Parade.

04:36.668 --> 04:38.674
As a member of
the Cutie Mark Crusaders

04:38.765 --> 04:40.337
you'd be able to ride
on it with us.

04:40.388 --> 04:41.868
It'd be totally fun.

04:42.868 --> 04:43.577
Uh...

04:43.845 --> 04:45.468
More like funny...

04:45.622 --> 04:49.137
Looking! Ha-ha-ha!

04:50.462 --> 04:53.000
What is that thing?
A giant orange?

04:53.734 --> 04:55.289
It's a pumpkin!

04:57.445 --> 05:00.045
More like a lame-kin.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.371
Who's the new blank flank?

05:06.571 --> 05:08.422
She's my cousin, Babs.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.440
She's from Manehattan.

05:10.742 --> 05:12.451
Manehattan, huh?

05:12.708 --> 05:15.560
Well, I guess you have
that going for you.

05:16.097 --> 05:18.257
Suppose you're gonna join
their little club?

05:18.331 --> 05:21.514
What's it called?
The Cutie Mark Crusaders.

05:29.548 --> 05:32.097
More like
the Cutie Mark Crybabies.

05:33.628 --> 05:37.171
- Hey!
- Ooh. Big city attitude.

05:37.388 --> 05:39.765
I like it.
Mm-hm.

05:40.062 --> 05:42.914
Oh, yeah? Well, there's more
where that came from.

05:43.034 --> 05:45.662
Check this out. Unh!

05:46.302 --> 05:47.725
Oh, no, she didn't.

05:58.462 --> 06:02.142
Looks like somepony's pumpkin
just got squashed.

06:05.554 --> 06:07.137
When I tell Applejack--

06:07.325 --> 06:09.262
You gonna tell
Applejack what?

06:09.560 --> 06:11.148
Well, you know, uh...

06:11.205 --> 06:13.411
What are you, a snitch?

06:13.805 --> 06:14.765
Come on, Babs.

06:14.897 --> 06:16.097
You should hang with us.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.165
You know, the cool ponies.

06:18.177 --> 06:19.622
Not these babies.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.908
What just happened?

06:25.982 --> 06:28.491
I think Babs just
went to the dark side.

06:28.794 --> 06:30.377
We have to tell Applejack.

06:30.405 --> 06:32.834
No. We're not snitches.

06:32.868 --> 06:35.788
Yeah.
And we're not babies.

06:36.742 --> 06:39.720
Then why do I
feel like crying?

06:44.850 --> 06:47.880
I still can't believe
she ruined our pumpkin float.

06:47.937 --> 06:51.628
I still can't believe
I'm related to such a big stinking bully.

06:52.474 --> 06:53.874
What are we going to do?

06:55.234 --> 06:57.908
We're gonna build a new float,
that's what.

06:57.925 --> 06:59.308
Why bother?

06:59.325 --> 07:01.445
She'll probably just
ruin that one too.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.542
We could always
tell Applejack.

07:06.508 --> 07:08.942
What are you, a snitch?

07:09.240 --> 07:10.005
No!

07:11.365 --> 07:13.645
We're not gonna be
a bunch of tattletales.

07:13.897 --> 07:16.880
Besides, she's only here
a couple of weeks.

07:16.971 --> 07:19.880
We'll just avoid her like
the plague until she goes home.

07:20.228 --> 07:22.902
Avoid her. Yeah.
How hard can that be?

07:25.171 --> 07:26.730
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

07:26.908 --> 07:28.380
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

07:28.720 --> 07:31.140
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah</i>

07:32.045 --> 07:35.171
<i>First we thought that Babs
Was so really, really sweet</i>

07:35.371 --> 07:36.891
<i>A new friend to have</i>

07:36.931 --> 07:38.925
<i>And it seemed like
Such a treat</i>

07:39.188 --> 07:40.650
<i>But then we found the truth</i>

07:40.685 --> 07:42.617
<i>She's just a bully
From the east</i>

07:42.662 --> 07:46.428
<i>She went from Babs, yeah
To a bully and a beast</i>

07:46.760 --> 07:49.788
<i>Everywhere we turn
She's just a step ahead</i>

07:49.805 --> 07:52.908
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed
What we gonna do?</i>

07:52.925 --> 07:54.691
<i>Got a bully on our tail</i>

07:54.708 --> 07:56.485
<i>Gotta hide
We gotta bail</i>

07:56.925 --> 08:00.005
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed
If she's after you</i>

08:00.034 --> 08:01.788
<i>Gotta run
We gotta flee</i>

08:01.794 --> 08:03.520
<i>Gotta hurry
Don't you see</i>

08:04.468 --> 08:07.982
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed
She's just a bad, bad seed</i>

08:08.000 --> 08:09.348
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

08:09.554 --> 08:11.160
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

08:11.342 --> 08:13.800
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah</i>

08:14.674 --> 08:17.805
<i>Hiding from a bully
We know it isn't right</i>

08:17.834 --> 08:19.588
<i>But the Cutie Mark Crusaders</i>

08:19.594 --> 08:21.240
<i>We aren't lookin'
For a fight</i>

08:21.771 --> 08:23.348
<i>Oh, she'll go home soon</i>

08:23.360 --> 08:25.371
<i>And then we'll have
Some peace again</i>

08:25.725 --> 08:28.908
<i>But for now we're stayin'
Out of her way till then</i>

08:29.268 --> 08:32.490
<i>Everywhere we turn
She's just a step ahead</i>

08:32.502 --> 08:35.600
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed
What we gonna do?</i>

08:35.611 --> 08:39.148
<i>Gotta a bully on our tail
Gotta hide, we gotta bail</i>

08:39.605 --> 08:42.680
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed
If she's after you</i>

08:42.685 --> 08:44.457
<i>You gotta run
We gotta flee</i>

08:44.468 --> 08:46.257
<i>Gotta hurry
Don't you see</i>

08:46.697 --> 08:48.080
<i>Why so mean?</i>

08:48.462 --> 08:49.880
<i>Why so crude?</i>

08:50.228 --> 08:51.920
<i>Why so angry?</i>

08:51.931 --> 08:53.468
<i>Why so rude?</i>

08:53.742 --> 08:55.125
<i>Can't you be nice?</i>

08:55.571 --> 08:57.005
<i>Can't we be friends?</i>

08:57.348 --> 09:00.902
<i> Isn't it sad
Is this how it all ends? </i>

09:00.920 --> 09:02.697
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed</i>

09:02.742 --> 09:04.462
<i> She's just a bad, bad</i>

09:04.480 --> 09:06.211
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed</i>

09:06.217 --> 09:07.977
<i> She's just a bad, bad</i>

09:08.000 --> 09:09.714
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed</i>

09:09.914 --> 09:12.468
<i>She's just a bad, bad seed</i>

09:14.468 --> 09:16.731
Babs may have
run us out of town,

09:16.834 --> 09:18.554
but at least we still
have the club--

09:20.685 --> 09:23.691
Hey! What are you doing
at my clubhouse?

09:24.148 --> 09:26.771
Your clubhouse?

09:27.040 --> 09:29.457
This is our clubhouse!

09:29.720 --> 09:32.965
Well, it was yours.
And now it's mine.

09:32.982 --> 09:34.137
And mine.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.691
And mine.

09:36.165 --> 09:37.702
That's not fair, Babs.

09:38.102 --> 09:39.925
We never did anything to you.

09:40.171 --> 09:44.588
And let's keep it that way.
Now scram, crybabies.

09:45.062 --> 09:47.737
<i>Bump, bump
Sugarlump, rump!</i>

10:04.742 --> 10:07.525
That Babs has really
gone too far this time.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.720
Kicked out of
our own clubhouse.

10:10.005 --> 10:11.297
And my own bed.

10:11.662 --> 10:12.760
Seriously?

10:13.188 --> 10:14.880
Super seriously.

10:15.354 --> 10:17.188
We need to talk
to Applejack.

10:19.565 --> 10:20.411
No!

10:20.445 --> 10:22.091
- Rarity?
- No!

10:22.811 --> 10:23.954
Twilight?

10:24.108 --> 10:25.828
No, no, no.

10:26.028 --> 10:28.280
We need to fight back.

10:28.531 --> 10:30.154
Yeah, fight back!

10:30.634 --> 10:31.828
How are we gonna do that?

10:35.000 --> 10:39.051
By making her the guest of honor
at the Summer Harvest Parade.

10:39.571 --> 10:41.577
Yeah! Wait. What?

10:43.657 --> 10:46.211
When you look up "embarrassed"
in the dictionary,

10:46.931 --> 10:49.331
her face will be there.

10:59.640 --> 11:00.794
Moo!

11:01.480 --> 11:02.685
Moo!

11:03.428 --> 11:04.462
Moo!

11:06.680 --> 11:08.028
Moo!

11:21.777 --> 11:23.851
Are those from
the Carousel Boutique?

11:24.428 --> 11:25.942
Yep.
Excellent.

11:28.411 --> 11:29.160
Ooh!

11:29.680 --> 11:31.794
Luster dust from
Sugercube Corner.

11:31.834 --> 11:33.474
They use it for
decorating cakes.

11:33.857 --> 11:37.674
That must be what Rarity uses
on her emergency edible boots.

11:38.205 --> 11:40.314
The gears and bands for
the moving mechanism,

11:40.331 --> 11:41.400
my tools and stuff.

11:41.948 --> 11:43.668
Did you bring the thing?

11:43.820 --> 11:45.034
From the place?

11:45.685 --> 11:46.611
What's that?

11:47.137 --> 11:49.257
Granny Smith's
kitchen timer.

11:49.651 --> 11:52.948
What's that for?
You'll see. Heh-heh.

11:52.977 --> 11:55.051
Come on, y'all.
Let's get to it.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.200
We only got a few hours
before morning

11:57.234 --> 11:59.354
and this thing
has to look so good,

11:59.548 --> 12:02.617
Babs won't be able to resist
wanting to ride in it.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.565
Is this it?

12:38.382 --> 12:41.297
I think we're a go.

12:42.460 --> 12:46.280
Good, because we better get out
of here before Babs finds us.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.405
Cutie Mark Crusaders, ho!

12:51.502 --> 12:54.160
Hot carrot crepes!
Get 'em here.

12:54.205 --> 12:55.697
Get 'em hot!

13:11.354 --> 13:13.405
Whoa!

13:14.622 --> 13:16.342
Isn't it smashing?

13:17.022 --> 13:18.520
No, I didn't mean smash.

13:18.617 --> 13:20.114
I mean, isn't it a hit?

13:20.588 --> 13:23.200
No, no hit! No hitting.
I mean---

13:24.034 --> 13:26.394
Well, don't even think
about riding it, Babs.

13:47.205 --> 13:48.502
You had your chance.

14:01.234 --> 14:04.537
See you later,
Cutie Mark Crybabies.

14:05.285 --> 14:06.382
The timer set?

14:09.091 --> 14:11.931
Teach her to fool
with the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.154
Y'all are lettin' Babs ride
in your golden apple float?

14:15.617 --> 14:16.537
Yeah.

14:16.714 --> 14:21.314
We thought she deserved to be
the center of attention.

14:24.394 --> 14:26.565
Well, that's just
super sweet of y'all.

14:26.874 --> 14:28.560
Makin' Babs feel so special.

14:28.862 --> 14:31.531
You know after all the heartache she's
been having in Manehattan.

14:32.417 --> 14:33.274
Heartache?

14:33.360 --> 14:36.680
Well, I didn't say nothing because
I didn't want her to feel singled out,

14:36.870 --> 14:39.188
but there's been some bullies
back in Manehattan

14:39.194 --> 14:41.650
just been teasin' her to pieces
for her blank flank.

14:42.125 --> 14:43.251
T-T-Teased?

14:43.280 --> 14:45.234
B-Bullies?

14:46.040 --> 14:46.514
Yup.

14:46.891 --> 14:49.994
She came out to the farm to get away
from all her problems back home.

14:51.405 --> 14:54.497
I'm so proud of y'all.
You done a good deed.

14:56.417 --> 15:00.577
So that's why she jumped in when
Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon

15:00.588 --> 15:02.245
started giving us
a hard time.

15:02.342 --> 15:04.417
She didn't want to be
bullied like at home

15:04.440 --> 15:07.177
so she decided to
be a bully instead.

15:08.091 --> 15:11.348
And now we've turned
into bullies too.

15:13.068 --> 15:15.137
What'll we do?

15:19.062 --> 15:21.228
Nice float, Babs.

15:21.428 --> 15:24.800
Snagged it from those
whiny-baby blank flanks.

15:24.885 --> 15:27.828
Too cool for mule, Babs.

15:30.411 --> 15:31.948
We gotta stop that float.

15:38.691 --> 15:40.468
Applejack. Quick, you have--
( band playing loudly )

15:40.970 --> 15:43.485
Huh?
Quick, you have to help us!

15:44.040 --> 15:44.714
What?

15:45.588 --> 15:46.948
We booby-trapped it!

15:49.217 --> 15:51.685
Babs. Bully. Payback.
No time to explain.

15:51.690 --> 15:53.548
We've just got to get
Babs out of that float.

16:04.514 --> 16:06.971
Oof, my popcorn!
Sorry! Excuse me!

16:07.291 --> 16:09.188
Excuse me. Ow! Whoops.

16:20.102 --> 16:21.731
Pinkie Pie, let us in.

16:23.748 --> 16:24.794
Funny joke.

16:24.965 --> 16:28.222
No, really.
Let us in!

16:28.474 --> 16:29.434
Oh!

16:30.297 --> 16:31.102
Here.

16:43.788 --> 16:46.102
Babs, you gotta
get out of that float!

16:46.251 --> 16:49.200
You're not getting your
float back, crybabies.

16:49.234 --> 16:50.725
But it's booby trap--

16:52.205 --> 16:54.148
- Veggie salad!
- Huh?

16:54.490 --> 16:56.474
Veggie salad!

17:01.354 --> 17:03.251
Veggie salad.

17:05.485 --> 17:06.314
Seriously?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.148
Hey, don't leave me!

17:11.502 --> 17:15.148
Ha-ha! "Leave" me!
Ha-ha-ha!

17:24.502 --> 17:25.182
What the--?

17:26.251 --> 17:27.640
Babs!

17:30.605 --> 17:31.782
Babs!

17:38.300 --> 17:41.651
Oh, sweet apple sauce!

17:51.154 --> 17:55.571
Maybe we'll get our cutie marks
in "Stupidest Ideas of All Time."

17:58.480 --> 17:59.600
Are y'all okay?

18:00.125 --> 18:02.354
Yeah, we're fine.

18:02.874 --> 18:03.697
No sweat.

18:04.457 --> 18:07.834
After I'd been so mean to you,
you saved me.

18:08.251 --> 18:10.508
Uh, about that...

18:12.417 --> 18:14.617
I don't get it.
I saw it all happen.

18:15.217 --> 18:16.828
You pushed me out
just when the float

18:16.834 --> 18:18.205
was about to head
into the lake.

18:18.548 --> 18:22.502
Except we were the reason
it was headed into the lake.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.942
We booby-trapped the float.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.325
You see, Babs,

18:27.531 --> 18:29.062
we were trying
to get you back

18:29.108 --> 18:30.617
for being a big bully.

18:31.270 --> 18:32.857
But then Applejack told us

18:32.914 --> 18:35.640
about how you were being
bullied back in Manehattan.

18:36.131 --> 18:37.834
And we figured out
you were just doing it

18:37.840 --> 18:40.131
to avoid getting
picked on in Ponyville.

18:40.485 --> 18:43.891
But by then, we were
the ones being bullies.

18:43.954 --> 18:44.360
And...

18:45.068 --> 18:48.057
Oh, why does life
have to be so ironic?

18:48.931 --> 18:50.765
Guess what we're
trying to say is...

18:51.388 --> 18:53.348
We're sorry.

18:55.337 --> 18:56.794
I'm sorry too.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.771
Ah. You know, this all
could've been avoided

18:59.805 --> 19:02.097
if y'all just came to me
in the very beginning.

19:02.554 --> 19:04.788
That's what I
kept on saying.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.365
So can we start over?

19:09.691 --> 19:11.720
Definitely.
Yeah.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.925
We, the Cutie Mark Crusaders,
elect Babs Seed to join us

19:33.948 --> 19:39.982
as a sister, friend, confidante,
ally, bosom buddy, gal pal,

19:40.480 --> 19:43.034
compadre, chum of chums--

19:44.537 --> 19:45.754
Well, you wrote this.

19:46.874 --> 19:48.668
Oh, uh, yeah.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.954
Homegirl, amiga...

19:51.011 --> 19:53.560
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Oh, yes, here.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.617
And fellow
Cutie Mark Crusader!

19:57.457 --> 20:00.394
You are solemnly sworn in
here this day

20:00.422 --> 20:02.554
in witness
of your fellow sisters,

20:02.697 --> 20:05.137
friends, confidantes,

20:05.234 --> 20:07.674
bosom buddies, compadres--

20:07.708 --> 20:08.862
Congratulations !

20:09.022 --> 20:10.497
Gotta remember
to revise that.

20:19.748 --> 20:21.051
So you promise
you're going to start

20:21.057 --> 20:23.817
our Manehattan branch of the
Cutie Mark Crusaders, right?

20:23.988 --> 20:26.417
Yeah. And I promise
to keep talking

20:26.428 --> 20:29.262
to my big sis about
the teasing back home.

20:29.314 --> 20:33.932
Good, and if you have any problems,
we've got your back too, you hear?

20:33.994 --> 20:35.651
So you're leaving, huh?

20:36.091 --> 20:40.045
Great. Now we're stuck here
with these lame blank flanks.

20:42.148 --> 20:45.691
Hey! That's not
how you talk to my friends.

20:45.748 --> 20:47.811
F-Friends??

20:48.040 --> 20:50.177
Yeah, you got a problem
with that?

20:50.251 --> 20:51.925
Well, what if I do?

20:52.194 --> 20:54.542
What are you gonna
do about it?

20:57.342 --> 21:00.320
Tell your mothers about
your bad attitudes.

21:09.548 --> 21:11.908
I'm sure gonna miss
that bad seed.

21:12.451 --> 21:13.554
Bad seed?

21:13.742 --> 21:15.302
I thought y'all
were friends now?

21:15.782 --> 21:18.680
No, see, first
we called her "Bad Seed,"

21:18.880 --> 21:20.457
as in actually
a "bad seed."

21:20.650 --> 21:23.680
But now she's "bad"
as in "good." Get it?

21:23.925 --> 21:25.914
Yeah... No.
