WEBVTT

00:05.172 --> 00:06.472
Get--get over here!

00:12.178 --> 00:13.645
Tents are lookin' good.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.181
And we made good time today.

00:15.483 --> 00:18.150
At this rate, we'll be at
Winsome Falls by tomorrow!

00:18.352 --> 00:20.619
We should do the annual big
sister little sister

00:20.721 --> 00:22.822
camping trip every weekend!

00:23.124 --> 00:24.957
Then it wouldn't be annual.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.558
And if we did it
every weekend,

00:26.660 --> 00:28.061
it probably wouldn't
be as special.

00:28.763 --> 00:31.831
But the more we do it, the
better we get at camping!

00:32.033 --> 00:33.432
Remember the first
time we came here

00:33.534 --> 00:35.701
and Rarity had that
gi-normous tent?

00:35.903 --> 00:36.835
I heard that!

00:37.805 --> 00:40.806
I've gotten much better at
roughing it, haven't I?

00:42.142 --> 00:45.344
Yup. This time you only
packed three suitcases!

00:47.180 --> 00:49.448
I know what you're
thinking, but I promise...

00:49.550 --> 00:51.583
I only brought
the essentials.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.553
Like those light thingies?

00:54.555 --> 00:55.287
Of course!

00:55.389 --> 00:57.956
What is life if you
can't make it beautiful?

01:02.562 --> 01:05.697
Mmm. These berries look
good enough to eat.

01:07.033 --> 01:07.800
DON'T!

01:08.202 --> 01:10.936
According to my book, they're
extremely poisonous!

01:19.713 --> 01:20.412
What!?

01:20.714 --> 01:22.815
I heard something; I
stepped on something

01:23.017 --> 01:25.385
and I saw that
creepy cave.

01:25.787 --> 01:28.387
I guess I still get
a little bit scared out here,

01:28.489 --> 01:30.422
even after the
last camping trip.

01:30.824 --> 01:34.926
Don't worry, kid, you've
got a big sister this time!

01:38.765 --> 01:40.233
Apple Bloom: This looks amazing!

01:40.835 --> 01:44.269
This is going to be the best
big sister/little sister

01:44.371 --> 01:45.771
camping trip ever!

01:55.949 --> 01:57.616
Aaaahhhhhh!

02:44.564 --> 02:46.299
Ow! What are these things!?

02:46.800 --> 02:47.676
Aaahh!

02:48.001 --> 02:49.168
Fly-ders!

02:49.570 --> 02:51.370
Everypony run for cover!

02:51.572 --> 02:52.838
Don't get stuck
in their...

02:53.707 --> 02:54.440
...web!

02:56.377 --> 02:57.743
Agh! Now what!?

02:57.945 --> 02:59.244
Follow me, everypony!

03:04.485 --> 03:05.051
Scootaloo: Agh!

03:05.753 --> 03:07.652
Not the scary cave!

03:11.625 --> 03:13.593
Where did those
terrible bugs come from?

03:14.195 --> 03:15.861
And why did they
destroy our camp?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.230
Fly-ders are from
the Luna Bay Area.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.532
Never seen 'em this
far east though.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.434
Probably attracted
to the food.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.136
Best wait here
until they're gone.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.704
Oh, apple rot!

03:26.106 --> 03:27.707
What are we supposed to do now?

03:28.009 --> 03:30.776
We had games to play and
marshmallows to roast at camp!

03:31.078 --> 03:32.611
In here we got nothin'.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.247
That's not entirely true.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.716
We have each other.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.317
That's right.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.851
And if you girls want to,

03:39.953 --> 03:41.553
maybe we could tell some stories

03:41.655 --> 03:42.488
to pass the time.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.256
Rainbow: You want stories?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.492
I've got a ton of stories.

03:46.694 --> 03:50.496
Spoiler Alert: they're all
about me and how awesome I am.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.732
I was thinking more
like campfire stories...

03:53.934 --> 03:56.201
But we don't even
have a campfire.

03:56.503 --> 03:57.369
I got this!

03:59.539 --> 04:01.173
Wow. That was brave.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.543
Eh, it was no biggie..

04:06.980 --> 04:08.547
We aren't gonna
tell scary stories

04:08.649 --> 04:10.383
like our last camping
trip, are we?

04:11.285 --> 04:13.252
It's bad enough
just being in here.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.952
Don't worry, Scootaloo.

04:15.154 --> 04:18.390
I was gonna tell you mine and
Apple Bloom's favorite legend!

04:18.592 --> 04:20.159
Oh! You mean Rockhoof?

04:20.261 --> 04:21.293
I love that one!

04:21.795 --> 04:22.995
He was so strong and when he...

04:23.097 --> 04:25.531
Apple Bloom! Shhh. We
haven't heard it yet.

04:25.833 --> 04:26.898
Oh. OK.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.133
But it's so good!

04:28.835 --> 04:29.969
Well, it's true.

04:30.071 --> 04:33.305
Rockhoof was known far and wide
for his incredible strength

04:33.607 --> 04:35.374
but he didn't start
out that way.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.644
You see, Rockhoof was
a tiny little fella,

04:38.746 --> 04:39.745
the son of a farmer.

04:39.947 --> 04:40.812
Just like us!

04:41.814 --> 04:42.815
Heh heh heh...

04:43.917 --> 04:46.185
They lived in a village
that sat at the foot

04:46.287 --> 04:48.420
of a gigantic volcano.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.359
<i>And the village was protected by</i>
<i> an elite group of Guard Ponies</i>

04:54.561 --> 04:55.994
<i> called the Mighty Helm.</i>

04:56.096 --> 04:59.466
Ha ha ha ha!

05:00.968 --> 05:03.568
<i> Young Rockhoof wanted nothing</i>
<i> more than to be part</i>

05:03.670 --> 05:04.769
<i> of the Mighty Helm...</i>

05:09.008 --> 05:11.376
Ha ha ha ha ha!

05:11.478 --> 05:13.478
<i> ...but he was told that</i>
<i> he was too scrawny</i>

05:13.580 --> 05:14.880
<i> and weak to protect</i>
<i> the village.</i>

05:22.489 --> 05:25.190
<i> But Rockhoof wouldn't</i>
<i> take "no" for an answer.</i>

05:29.630 --> 05:31.931
<i> Then one fateful day...</i>

05:32.833 --> 05:34.733
<i> The volcano erupted!</i>

05:37.370 --> 05:39.404
Eeeeeeeee!!

05:39.606 --> 05:41.006
This is my favorite part!

05:41.308 --> 05:42.741
All: What happened next!?

05:44.344 --> 05:47.346
The molten lava poured down
the side of the volcano...

05:49.415 --> 05:52.284
<i> ... and try as they might, the</i>
<i>Mighty Helm couldn't figure out</i>

05:52.386 --> 05:53.553
<i> a way to save the village.</i>

05:54.855 --> 05:56.188
<i> They had to evacuate.</i>

05:56.690 --> 05:59.090
<i> But the village ponies didn't</i>
<i> want to leave their homes!</i>

06:00.793 --> 06:02.661
<i> They spent their</i>
<i> entire lives there.</i>

06:02.763 --> 06:04.262
<i> They had nowhere else to go!</i>

06:08.101 --> 06:11.636
<i> So Rockhoof decided</i>
<i> to do something crazy.</i>

06:16.910 --> 06:19.544
<i> He thought if he could</i>
<i> divert the flow of the lava,</i>

06:19.646 --> 06:21.714
<i> he might be able to</i>
<i> save his village!</i>

06:22.516 --> 06:24.616
<i> He started digging a trench.</i>

06:25.018 --> 06:26.318
<i> Sweetie Belle: Wait a minute...</i>

06:26.820 --> 06:28.187
All by himself?

06:28.589 --> 06:32.290
It'd be impossible for one pony
to dig a trench fast enough

06:32.392 --> 06:33.625
to stop the lava!

06:33.727 --> 06:35.394
I mean, even I couldn't do that!

06:38.031 --> 06:39.865
Good thing Rockhoof
didn't believe

06:39.967 --> 06:42.068
in the word "impossible".

06:43.270 --> 06:46.338
<i> He continued to work, knowing</i>
<i> the odds were against him</i>

06:46.840 --> 06:48.440
<i>but determined to push through.</i>

06:50.877 --> 06:53.712
<i> Then... something</i>
<i> magical happened.</i>

06:58.952 --> 07:01.487
<i> Rockhoof got visibly stronger!</i>

07:01.989 --> 07:03.789
<i> But the lava was</i>
<i> getting closer...</i>

07:25.546 --> 07:28.013
<i> Through his extraordinary</i>
<i> determination</i>

07:28.215 --> 07:29.615
<i> and sheer force of will,</i>

07:30.117 --> 07:33.652
<i> Rockhoof more than earned</i>
<i> his place in the Mighty Helm.</i>

07:36.990 --> 07:37.856
Yeah!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.858
Good story,
Applejack!

07:39.960 --> 07:41.526
Even if it
wasn't about me.

07:42.996 --> 07:46.231
I love that story, no matter
how many times I hear it.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.733
Why don't we see if it's
safe to head back to camp?

07:48.835 --> 07:50.169
Sweetie Belle: Uh, girls?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.938
There is no camp to go back to.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.351
All our hard work is ruined.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.289
There, there. Sweetie Belle.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.658
Not to worry.

08:12.860 --> 08:16.728
How? Our camp was so pretty and
this cave is sooo...

08:17.330 --> 08:18.130
...not.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.667
Oh, nononono no, not true!

08:21.869 --> 08:23.302
There's beauty in everything.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.305
Even these blah rocks
aren't really blah!

08:26.407 --> 08:29.274
If you look closely, you can
see flecks of gold in them.

08:29.576 --> 08:32.511
And the way the firelight
dances on the cave wall...

08:32.813 --> 08:33.679
shadow and light!

08:33.781 --> 08:35.447
Ooooh, it's so gorgeous!

08:37.550 --> 08:41.520
Sweetie Belle, have I ever told
you about<i> my</i> favorite legend?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.122
No. I didn't know you had one.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.791
Her name was Mistmane.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.093
Mistmane?

08:48.695 --> 08:51.830
Isn't she the old wrinkly
sorceress with the flower?

08:52.232 --> 08:55.834
Yes. But did you
know she used to be

08:55.936 --> 08:59.538
the most beautiful
unicorn in all the land?

09:00.340 --> 09:01.006
No.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.075
So what happened to her?

09:03.377 --> 09:07.947
Well, Mistmane was a very
promising young sorceress.

09:08.649 --> 09:12.751
<i> She was as talented as she</i>
<i> was beautiful and kind.</i>

09:12.853 --> 09:14.886
<i> Everypony loved her</i>
<i> and missed her</i>

09:14.988 --> 09:17.188
<i> when she was sent to the</i>
<i> finest magic school.</i>

09:23.930 --> 09:26.732
<i> While she was gone, she was</i>
<i> delighted to find out</i>

09:26.834 --> 09:31.203
<i> that her best friend, Sable</i>
<i> Spirit, was crowned Empress.</i>

09:31.405 --> 09:34.574
<i>She couldn't wait to return home</i>
<i> once she finished her studies.</i>

09:35.376 --> 09:39.744
<i> But once she arrived, she was</i>
<i> devastated by what she saw.</i>

09:44.952 --> 09:46.618
What happened here?

09:46.820 --> 09:48.587
The Empress happened.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.890
She makes everypony work
day and night on her palace.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.593
We don't have time to take
care of anything else.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.860
Well, that can't be. I know her.

09:57.231 --> 09:59.098
She would never do this.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.968
<i> But there was no denying</i>
<i> what was in front of her.</i>

10:10.476 --> 10:12.878
<i> Sable Spirit took everything</i>
<i> that was beautiful</i>

10:12.980 --> 10:15.014
<i> away from anypony else.</i>

10:15.416 --> 10:19.050
<i> But Mistmane was sure there</i>
<i> had to be some explanation.</i>

10:21.020 --> 10:23.722
I'd assume there was
too, if somepony told me

10:23.824 --> 10:25.524
either one of you
two'd gone evil.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.459
Yeah, I'd never believe it.

10:27.961 --> 10:28.794
I dunno...

10:28.896 --> 10:31.197
I've seen the way you two
get when you miss breakfast.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.698
Ha! Just kidding!

10:33.800 --> 10:35.067
But I'd want answers, too.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.102
So did Mistmane.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.304
She went to confront her friend.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.378
Sable? Is that you?

10:46.880 --> 10:49.782
Don't tell me you don't
recognize your old friend.

10:50.284 --> 10:53.552
I don't. My friend would never
work our families and friends

10:53.654 --> 10:56.221
to the bone for something
as silly as a palace.

10:56.523 --> 11:00.158
Silly? My palace is
a beacon of beauty.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.263
Anypony who passes will
be in awe of its majesty.

11:04.465 --> 11:07.766
What good is a pretty palace if
it just hides the misery

11:07.868 --> 11:09.167
of its ponies?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.270
Beauty is everything.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.538
You taught me that.

11:13.740 --> 11:14.406
What!?

11:14.708 --> 11:16.308
You were always
the pretty one.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.910
You got to go to the
best magic school.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.745
Everypony missed you.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.481
Everypony loved you.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.550
I admit, I was jealous.

11:24.952 --> 11:28.854
So I tried to perform a spell
that would make me beautiful.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.523
You can see how<i> that</i> went.

11:32.827 --> 11:36.328
I vowed if I couldn't have
beauty, I would take it.

11:36.630 --> 11:39.030
I wasn't chosen to
be Empress, you know.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.566
I took it!

11:41.068 --> 11:44.736
Just like I'm going to
take everything else.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.738
Mistmane: I can't
let you do that.

11:48.340 --> 11:52.043
Let me? [laughter]

12:24.476 --> 12:25.110
Agh!

12:30.484 --> 12:32.984
<i> Rarity: Everypony thought</i>
<i> Sable Spirit was defeated</i>

12:33.086 --> 12:34.119
<i> and that was that.</i>

12:34.621 --> 12:37.656
<i> But Mistmane knew there was</i>
<i> more she could do to help.</i>

12:40.359 --> 12:43.728
<i> Beauty isn't everything, but</i>
<i>Mistmane knew that it does have</i>

12:43.830 --> 12:45.864
<i>the power to make ponies smile.</i>

12:50.704 --> 12:53.238
<i> She made a huge sacrifice to</i>
<i> bring that smile back</i>

12:53.340 --> 12:55.440
<i> to her friends' and</i>
<i> families' faces.</i>

12:57.778 --> 12:59.544
<i> Including Sable Spirit's.</i>

13:05.718 --> 13:07.352
You did this for me?

13:07.654 --> 13:10.989
Even after I was so cruel?

13:11.491 --> 13:13.458
<i> Sable Spirit was so touched</i>

13:13.660 --> 13:15.360
<i> that she vowed to be</i>
<i> more like her friend</i>

13:15.462 --> 13:16.862
<i> in the ways that mattered.</i>

13:16.964 --> 13:20.631
<i> From then on, she ruled with</i>
<i> kindness and compassion.</i>

13:32.812 --> 13:35.280
<i> Even though she gave</i>
<i> away her physical beauty,</i>

13:35.482 --> 13:37.582
<i> she dedicated her life to</i>
<i> spreading beauty</i>

13:37.684 --> 13:39.819
<i> all over Equestria.</i>

13:41.221 --> 13:44.155
<i> Anytime you go out of your way</i>
<i> to brighten somepony's day</i>

13:44.257 --> 13:46.591
<i> by doing something nice</i>
<i> like giving them flowers,</i>

13:46.893 --> 13:49.327
you're following in the
hoofsteps of Mistmane.

13:52.698 --> 13:55.466
I think she's my
favorite legend, too.

13:59.538 --> 14:02.273
Ahhh!!!!

14:03.075 --> 14:03.909
Ugh!

14:04.111 --> 14:05.977
These Fly-ders won't quit!

14:06.179 --> 14:07.679
What do they want from us now?

14:07.981 --> 14:10.882
Well, like it or
not, we're food too.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.118
And I've got the
bites to prove it!

14:13.220 --> 14:14.352
What are we going to do!?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.720
They're almost here!

14:22.428 --> 14:23.361
What?

14:23.463 --> 14:24.896
Now those bugs can't get in.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.600
And<i> we</i> can't get<i> out</i> !

14:29.902 --> 14:30.601
Ah!

14:37.577 --> 14:39.177
Let's all just stay calm.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.212
Lemme re-light this fire.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.018
We just have to wait
until the swarm moves on.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.586
Then we'll think of a way out.

14:48.788 --> 14:50.021
How long will
that be!?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.722
Don't bears live in caves!?

14:53.926 --> 14:54.626
Whoa, whoa.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.462
Scootaloo, you're focusing
on the wrong things.

14:57.664 --> 14:58.629
You have a plan!?

14:58.931 --> 14:59.497
Close.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.366
I have a story!

15:02.168 --> 15:04.369
Let me guess,
it's about you?

15:04.771 --> 15:05.871
Practically.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.841
It's about<i> my</i> favorite
legend, Flash Magnus.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.044
Wasn't he the pony who
took on the Dragons?

15:13.146 --> 15:13.978
Dragons!?

15:14.180 --> 15:16.281
Big, scary mean
ones or like Spike?

15:16.383 --> 15:20.451
Oh, these were definitely
the big scary mean kind.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.424
But not too scary.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.592
You can sit closer
to me if you want.

15:29.795 --> 15:34.366
A long time ago, before the
Wonderbolts were even founded,

15:34.868 --> 15:38.503
Flash Magnus was a lowly
cadet in the Royal Legion.

15:44.243 --> 15:47.111
And the Legion needed to
fly over the Dragon Lands

15:47.213 --> 15:49.348
to get to their comrades
on the other side.

15:49.850 --> 15:51.983
But as they got closer
to the Dragons...

15:53.386 --> 15:55.187
... The Dragons attacked!

15:55.689 --> 15:57.889
You said this wasn't too scary!

15:58.191 --> 16:00.558
[muffled] Scootaloo, if you
just hang in there...

16:00.660 --> 16:01.325
What?

16:02.928 --> 16:05.930
I said, if you
just hang in there,

16:06.032 --> 16:07.866
I promise you'll
like the ending.

16:08.068 --> 16:11.869
So, like I way saying, Flash
Magnus and the Royal Legion

16:11.971 --> 16:13.873
tried to get past the dragons...

16:14.875 --> 16:16.607
<i> ... but the Dragons</i>
<i> wouldn't let them.</i>

16:18.777 --> 16:22.146
Everypony, RETREAT!

16:24.950 --> 16:27.185
<i> Flash Magnus and a few other</i>
<i> cadets were separated</i>

16:27.287 --> 16:28.353
<i> from the battalion.</i>

16:31.757 --> 16:34.759
<i> He managed to get away but the</i>
<i> dragons captured his friends</i>

16:34.861 --> 16:36.294
<i> and took them back</i>
<i> to their lair.</i>

16:51.944 --> 16:52.744
Commander!

16:52.846 --> 16:54.713
We need to save our
captured comrades.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.448
I appreciate your
loyalty, Flash Magnus,

16:57.550 --> 17:00.385
but getting past those dragons
is going to be impossible!

17:00.587 --> 17:01.552
Nothing will work.

17:03.622 --> 17:04.989
<i> Apple Bloom: The Commander was right.</i>

17:05.291 --> 17:06.892
You can't
out-fight Dragons.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.994
But you can out-think them.

17:13.899 --> 17:17.936
Commander Ironhead, I'm pretty
sure I can out-fly the Dragons.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.838
If I can lure them
into chasing me,

17:20.040 --> 17:22.206
you can all sneak into the
lair and retrieve our friends

17:22.308 --> 17:23.275
before they get back.

17:24.677 --> 17:27.479
Are you really willing to
take that chance, Soldier?

17:28.081 --> 17:29.547
I am, Sir.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.251
It's a very brave
thing you're doing.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.153
You'll need all the
help you can get.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.492
Is this... Netitus?

17:40.994 --> 17:42.361
The fireproof shield?

17:43.263 --> 17:45.897
It has protected legion
heroes for generations

17:45.999 --> 17:48.800
and today I can't think
of a worthier flank

17:48.902 --> 17:50.335
for Netitus to protect!

17:51.737 --> 17:52.771
Good luck, soldier.

17:58.534 --> 17:59.211
Phew..

17:59.312 --> 18:03.381
Hey! Come and get me,
fire breath! If you can!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.216
Hey! Hey! Come and get me!

18:05.618 --> 18:06.551
Hey! I'm over here!

18:12.925 --> 18:15.627
<i> While Flash Magnus</i>
<i> bravely flew for his life,</i>

18:15.929 --> 18:18.463
<i> Commander Ironhead was able</i>
<i> to get his soldiers back.</i>

18:22.869 --> 18:24.702
<i>Flash Magnus flew like the wind.</i>

18:28.074 --> 18:29.374
<i> Faster than the dragons!</i>

18:34.814 --> 18:37.115
<i> But he knew he couldn't</i>
<i> do this forever.</i>

18:39.084 --> 18:41.119
<i> Luckily, he had a plan.</i>

18:53.833 --> 18:56.234
<i> He led the dragons</i>
<i> straight into a storm</i>

18:56.336 --> 18:57.602
<i> that the Legion had planted.</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:04.141
<i> One taste of the lightning</i>
<i> and the dragons retreated!</i>

19:13.253 --> 19:15.754
<i> Flash Magnus' plan worked!</i>

19:27.265 --> 19:27.832
Scootaloo: Wow!

19:27.934 --> 19:29.333
I did like that ending.

19:29.735 --> 19:30.435
Told ya!

19:30.737 --> 19:34.338
He always inspired me to be
my brave and awesome self.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.406
Mmhmm!

19:35.508 --> 19:38.009
Yeah, I guess he kinda
reminds me of you.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.644
You guess?

19:39.846 --> 19:40.711
Come on!

19:40.813 --> 19:41.780
I'm just like him.

19:46.885 --> 19:48.152
Hey, d'you hear that?

19:48.921 --> 19:50.989
Uh.. I don't hear anything.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.423
Exactly.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.725
Those gosh darn
fly-ders are gone!

19:55.027 --> 19:55.960
We can get out!

19:58.530 --> 19:59.197
Whoa!

20:00.532 --> 20:01.633
Or not.

20:01.735 --> 20:03.902
We're gonna have to see if we
can get out the other way.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.940
You mean go further into
the dark, spooky cave?

20:09.242 --> 20:11.810
Scootaloo, just
remember the story.

20:12.012 --> 20:15.079
You've gotta be brave like
me and Flash Magnus. OK?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.086
I hear water!

20:22.288 --> 20:24.122
And if there's
flowing water, then...

20:24.224 --> 20:25.990
It might lead to the way out!

20:26.792 --> 20:28.192
Ohhh!

20:28.494 --> 20:30.361
OK on three!

20:30.863 --> 20:31.429
One.

20:31.831 --> 20:32.397
Two.

20:32.899 --> 20:33.831
THREE!

20:39.238 --> 20:40.104
Woohoo!

20:40.206 --> 20:41.339
Yeah!

20:45.478 --> 20:47.011
Well, whaddaya know?

20:47.113 --> 20:50.314
We found ourselves a
shortcut to Winsome Falls!

20:50.416 --> 20:53.751
Scootaloo: Oh.. It's never
looked so beautiful!

20:54.153 --> 20:55.719
Well, almost...

20:59.958 --> 21:01.626
We sure are sorry
that our camping trip

21:01.728 --> 21:03.094
wasn't what we
hoped it would be.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.328
Are you kidding?

21:04.430 --> 21:05.964
This trip is awesome!

21:07.166 --> 21:07.832
It is?

21:08.234 --> 21:11.803
We got to hear legendary stories
and go on an adventure.

21:12.205 --> 21:14.372
Wait, you three want to stay?

21:14.574 --> 21:16.075
Of course we do!

21:17.077 --> 21:20.111
We could turn those trees
into a nice little shelter.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.247
We can get you some big logs
and branches to help build it.

21:23.349 --> 21:25.749
And I bet we can find
some more berries.

21:25.851 --> 21:26.318
Come on!

21:26.920 --> 21:29.821
Ooo.. I can't wait to see
what happens next year!
