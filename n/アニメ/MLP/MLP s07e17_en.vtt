WEBVTT

00:04.005 --> 00:06.572
Ha! Straight to the
changeling hive.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.174
I told you I could do it.

00:08.376 --> 00:11.043
Well, not exactly
"straight" Starlight.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.012
We've been popping
all around Equestria

00:13.114 --> 00:14.947
and we still
have to walk.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.082
Pfft. It's like twelve
steps away.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.918
Before Chrysalis'
throne was destroyed,

00:19.020 --> 00:22.387
the closest magic would have
gotten us was waaay over there.

00:25.892 --> 00:28.894
On a scale of one-to-ten, how
happy do you think Thorax

00:28.996 --> 00:31.030
is going to be about
our surprise visit?

00:31.332 --> 00:32.631
Definitely ten.

00:32.833 --> 00:36.001
I mean, who wouldn't be happy
at the chance to marvel

00:36.103 --> 00:38.404
at the overwhelming
talent that is...

00:38.706 --> 00:41.607
the Great and Powerful Trixie?

00:43.110 --> 00:45.177
Trixie, we're coming
to offer Thorax

00:45.279 --> 00:46.879
encouragement
and support.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.481
His letters make it seem like
the responsibilities of being

00:49.583 --> 00:52.284
the changeling leader are
a little overwhelming.

00:52.586 --> 00:53.719
Yeah, I know.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.121
That's basically what I said.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.823
He's dealing with the wants
and needs of his subjects,

00:58.425 --> 00:59.858
redesigning the hive,

00:59.960 --> 01:02.428
a Dread Maulwurf
wreaking havoc outside.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.663
It does sound
like a lot, but...

01:04.765 --> 01:06.565
are you sure that
last thing is real?

01:06.767 --> 01:07.999
The Dread Maulwurf?

01:08.101 --> 01:09.001
Sure it is.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.037
Thorax said it's like
half-bear, half-mole,

01:12.139 --> 01:14.240
half-raging pile of claws.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.508
But now that the changelings
don't feed on the love of

01:16.610 --> 01:19.078
everything around them, plants
have started to grow back.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.413
But this Maulwurf keeps
eating them all up.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.249
Maulwurf. Uh-huh.

01:24.351 --> 01:25.751
You're just trying
to scare me.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.320
But it won't work
because not only am I

01:28.422 --> 01:34.426
the Great and Powerful, I am
also the Unscareable Trixie!

01:35.496 --> 01:35.961
Rahr!

01:38.799 --> 01:41.400
[gasp] Please tell me Thorax also
mentioned a terrifying-looking

01:41.502 --> 01:43.903
changeling who greets visitors
but is actually nice?

01:44.805 --> 01:45.304
Nope.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.506
And I'm not nice.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.950
Starlight, you got us
here, I'll take us home.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.052
Teleportation spell, go!

02:01.154 --> 02:01.920
Trixie: Did I save us?

02:02.222 --> 02:02.754
Starlight: Nope.

02:48.368 --> 02:49.601
What are you
waiting for?

02:49.703 --> 02:51.637
Use some magic to
get us out of here!

02:51.739 --> 02:53.906
Calm down,
Unscareable Trixie.

02:54.108 --> 02:55.974
Huh. We have to find out
what's going on.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.442
Thorax might
need our help.

02:57.644 --> 02:58.844
We need our help!

02:58.946 --> 03:02.647
Teleportation spell, go!
Teleportation spell, go!

03:03.484 --> 03:04.616
Teleportation spell...

03:04.718 --> 03:06.652
Ugh. Why do you keep
doing that?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.087
You know it doesn't
work that way.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.288
I know! But this
is my process.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.323
Gah!

03:11.425 --> 03:13.625
I captured these
trespassers.

03:13.827 --> 03:14.693
Thorax: Starlight?

03:15.195 --> 03:15.894
Trixie?

03:16.096 --> 03:17.296
It's OK, Pharynx.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.364
You can let them go.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.632
But they were lurking
on our grounds!

03:20.734 --> 03:23.802
In the old days, I would have
already feasted on their love.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.138
Well, that's why they're
called the old days.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.573
Because they're old.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.741
We don't do that anymore.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.347
Ugh. I liked the old days better.

03:37.650 --> 03:38.917
What are you
two doing here?

03:39.119 --> 03:40.619
We wanted to
surprise you.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.654
Surprise..!

03:43.156 --> 03:45.290
Well, it's great to see you.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.759
I'm sorry about the
welcome committee.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.631
I thought Ember helped
you get more assertive

03:52.733 --> 03:54.766
so you could deal with all
the renegade changelings

03:54.868 --> 03:56.034
who didn't want to change?

03:56.136 --> 03:58.337
Oh, she did. Really helpful.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.706
I was able to convince
all of them to change...

04:01.008 --> 04:02.607
except one of them.

04:02.909 --> 04:03.809
My brother.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.077
Your brother?

04:05.379 --> 04:08.046
Yep. Pharynx is my
elder brood mate.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.684
Oh, yeah.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.452
You guys have the same...

04:15.721 --> 04:16.355
...eye shape?

04:17.257 --> 04:20.259
What a ridiculous comparison.
We are nothing alike.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.829
Stop doing that!

04:24.231 --> 04:25.898
The hive looked
better with holes...

04:30.770 --> 04:33.772
Uh. Well, how about I show
you the rest of the hive

04:33.874 --> 04:35.640
where it's less
loud and bang-y?

04:38.110 --> 04:41.013
There've been a lot of changes
since you were here last.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.915
I'm trying to start some new
activities since the only thing

04:44.017 --> 04:46.084
we did before was
hunt and patrol.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.253
There's theater...

04:48.455 --> 04:49.421
...swing dancing,

04:51.091 --> 04:53.459
a once-a-week
potluck lunch...

04:53.761 --> 04:57.662
Ooh! And who can change shape
and organize craft time?

04:59.099 --> 05:00.032
This guy!

05:00.234 --> 05:02.134
I am really impressed, Thorax.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.735
The hive, all the activities...

05:03.837 --> 05:05.737
Agh! He did it again!

05:05.839 --> 05:08.874
Pharynx dumped an entire
can of black paint on me!

05:09.076 --> 05:12.944
He said my fuchsia color wasn't
"intimidating to our enemies."

05:13.146 --> 05:14.346
What enemies!?

05:14.548 --> 05:16.315
I am so sorry.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.883
I promise I'll
talk to him.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.918
You're the ruler of
the hive, Thorax.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.187
You need to do
more than talk!

05:23.189 --> 05:26.591
Well.. maybe not everything
here is amazing.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.460
Seriously, Thorax.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.996
What is up with your brother?

05:30.498 --> 05:33.832
[sigh] Pharynx used to
be Head of Patrol.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.435
But now we're peaceful and
there's no need to patrol,

05:36.537 --> 05:40.139
so he just stalks around the
hive making everyone miserable.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.242
The other changelings are sick
of it and if I can't get him

05:43.344 --> 05:46.612
to accept love and friendship
and change like the rest of us,

05:46.914 --> 05:48.680
everything I've done
here is at risk.

05:50.650 --> 05:51.416
Uh uh!

05:51.618 --> 05:52.618
Mmmmm....?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.120
[sigh] Uh huh...

05:55.222 --> 05:58.223
We know a thing or two about
what it's like to be outsiders.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.958
Maybe we could talk
to him for you.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.527
Do you really
think you could help?

06:01.829 --> 06:04.663
Thorax, if there's anypony
who can help your brother...

06:04.765 --> 06:05.598
it's me.

06:06.100 --> 06:10.101
And with Starlight helping, it
might take slightly longer,

06:10.203 --> 06:11.970
but I guarantee
you we can do it.

06:14.307 --> 06:17.008
Thorax, we're ready to start
work on the trail of plants

06:17.110 --> 06:18.276
to lead the Maulwurf away.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.078
Oh. I have to head outside.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.947
You're sure you're
OK handling Pharynx?

06:22.249 --> 06:23.281
Absolutely!

06:30.289 --> 06:32.824
Yeah. We totally
got this!

06:42.069 --> 06:43.869
So. How do you
want to play this?

06:43.971 --> 06:46.405
I'm thinking good
pony/bad pony.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.707
You yell and blast
him with magic,

06:48.809 --> 06:52.544
while my natural charisma
will convince him that--

06:53.546 --> 06:54.380
Starlight?

06:54.982 --> 06:57.116
Hey, Pharynx.

06:57.318 --> 07:00.752
I know when we first met,
it didn't go so well...

07:00.954 --> 07:02.120
I put you in a bag.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.288
I thought it went great.

07:03.689 --> 07:04.165
Yah!

07:04.490 --> 07:05.958
Right. [ahem]

07:06.160 --> 07:09.428
So... not a big fan
of the vines, huh?

07:09.730 --> 07:10.796
They're a safety hazard.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.565
An enemy could hide in them
or use them as weapons.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.267
I don't even know
why they're here.

07:15.369 --> 07:16.768
Because they're pretty?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.103
That's ridiculous.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.205
Oh. Totally.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.540
We get you.

07:21.942 --> 07:26.311
But ahem.. maybe don't express how
you feel by destroying them?

07:26.613 --> 07:28.213
I don't take advice
from ponies.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.750
The only thing I take
from you is breakfast.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.751
At least I used to.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.953
You know, you're a
lot like us.

07:35.255 --> 07:35.887
Doubt it.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.290
Trixie: It's true.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.592
Do you know who
Twilight Sparkle is?

07:40.794 --> 07:41.292
No.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.929
Well, she's the most
well-liked, studious,

07:44.031 --> 07:46.198
do-goodiest pony
in Equestria.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.133
Ugh. She sounds awful.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.901
Oh, you'd hate
her. I used to.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.103
She made me unsure about
my place in the world,

07:52.205 --> 07:54.039
which led me to act
out against her.

07:54.241 --> 07:58.143
And I used to be a dictator who
ran a village with an iron hoof!

07:58.445 --> 08:02.847
Really? Hmm. Maybe you
two do understand me.

08:02.949 --> 08:04.083
Yes! We do!

08:04.485 --> 08:07.919
But now, Trixie has come to
terms with being second-best...

08:08.421 --> 08:11.290
And I no longer control
ponies against their will.

08:11.492 --> 08:14.359
And our lives are so
much better for it.

08:14.961 --> 08:18.096
Wow. So you're both losers.

08:18.298 --> 08:21.533
Stay away from me or I'll do
to you what I did to the vines.

08:23.469 --> 08:27.939
Well, operation Lead Maulwurf
away is coming along.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.641
How'd it go with Pharynx?

08:30.243 --> 08:33.612
Your brother is...um,
challenging.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.213
Oh. That bad, huh?

08:35.315 --> 08:36.281
It wasn't great.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.016
You want to talk it out?

08:38.118 --> 08:40.986
You can come with me
to the Feelings Forum.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.488
The Feeling what, now?

08:42.990 --> 08:46.458
Oh. It's a place for changelings
to express their feelings

08:46.560 --> 08:49.494
so we all gain a better
understanding of each other.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.030
It's really helped bring
the hive closer together.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.235
<i> Sometimes I feel like</i>
<i> I'm a blue changeling.</i>

08:57.337 --> 08:59.738
Sometimes I feel like
I'm a purple changeling.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.273
But here I am,
a green one.

09:02.575 --> 09:04.776
You can be anything
you want to be.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.212
Be blue one day and
purple the next.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.414
Be both on the same day!

09:09.716 --> 09:11.983
But then I feel like
I'd be living a lie.

09:12.285 --> 09:16.154
It's very brave of you to
share something so personal.

09:16.456 --> 09:19.691
Does anyone else have
similar concerns?

09:19.793 --> 09:23.494
I used to, but craft time has
given me such a creative outlet

09:23.596 --> 09:24.663
I feel great now.

09:25.465 --> 09:26.831
Everyone loves craft time.

09:29.069 --> 09:29.835
Well...

09:29.937 --> 09:32.337
everyone except
for you-know-who.

09:32.539 --> 09:35.807
Yeah. You-know-who spends all
his craft time making spears.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.377
He's scary and intimidating.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.780
You-know-who makes
me uncomfortable.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.848
He makes us all
uncomfortable!

09:43.950 --> 09:47.018
Everyone, please, I
understand Pharynx

09:47.120 --> 09:48.787
can be challenging
at times--

09:48.889 --> 09:50.155
That's an
understatement.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.090
He lined the
hallway with thorns!

09:52.292 --> 09:55.293
He teaches little changelings
to growl and hiss!

09:55.495 --> 09:56.928
My soup's too hot!

09:59.197 --> 09:59.731
What?

09:59.833 --> 10:02.233
I thought the Feelings Forum
was for sharing our problems?

10:02.435 --> 10:06.004
It sounds like your lame
Feelings Forum is for talking

10:06.106 --> 10:07.939
about me behind my back.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.276
The Feelings Forum is for
talking about anything

10:11.378 --> 10:12.811
that's bothering you.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.947
Is there something you'd
like to share, Pharynx?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.349
Actually, there is.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.385
The changelings used
to be a fearsome swarm.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.388
Now we sit around talking about
our feelings so much

10:23.490 --> 10:24.956
you can't even stop
a Maulwurf

10:25.058 --> 10:27.225
from eating all
your pretty plants.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.694
I could've sent that
thing packing before,

10:29.996 --> 10:31.963
but I guess now, we'll
just try to lead it away

10:32.065 --> 10:34.233
and hope that keeps us safe!

10:35.335 --> 10:37.502
I don't feel safe
with him around.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.471
I'd feel safer
if he were gone.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.105
I can't do that.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.107
We want him banished!

10:47.481 --> 10:49.079
Hey! My soup's cooled down!

10:49.281 --> 10:51.649
These Feelings Forums are
great for solving problems!

10:53.220 --> 10:57.488
Everyone, please, if we are
interrupting each other,

10:57.590 --> 11:00.058
we are not affirming
each other.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.964
That's it! Feelings
Forum is over!

11:14.241 --> 11:20.278
I....whew. I want to say something,
but it goes against everything

11:20.380 --> 11:22.013
I've been taught as
Twilight's pupil.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.950
Oooh. Then by all
means, say it.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.421
I think Pharynx is
a lost cause.

11:29.723 --> 11:32.924
Mm. I'm all for second
chances, third even,

11:33.126 --> 11:35.794
but he just seems
like a bad bug.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.396
And Thorax has a duty
to the whole hive,

11:38.598 --> 11:39.798
not just his brother.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.766
If he keeps sticking
up for Pharynx,

11:41.868 --> 11:44.569
the hive might decide they don't
want Thorax as their leader.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.505
I think he might have
to kick Pharynx out,

11:47.607 --> 11:50.041
but I don't want to be the
one to tell Thorax that.

11:50.343 --> 11:55.014
Me neither! But somepony
probably should.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.716
I nominate you!

11:58.018 --> 11:58.683
Ugh..

12:04.690 --> 12:07.559
Thorax... we have
something to tell you.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.028
It's about Pharynx, isn't it?

12:10.930 --> 12:14.232
Mmmmmmmmaybe?

12:14.334 --> 12:16.467
Look, I know he's an
aggressive warrior type,

12:16.569 --> 12:19.203
but when I was little,
every young changeling

12:19.305 --> 12:20.505
wanted to be like that.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.682
<i> Every young</i>
<i> changeling except me.</i>

12:31.084 --> 12:33.484
<i> The others would pick on me</i>
<i> for not wanting to fight.</i>

12:33.686 --> 12:37.422
Look at the little grub
playing with his dollies.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.228
Step away from
my brother.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.532
<i> But Pharynx never</i>
<i> let them hurt me.</i>

12:47.934 --> 12:50.701
Heh heh.. We were just
complimenting his dollies.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.713
Thanks, Pharynx.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.281
Why are you
hitting yourself?

13:03.383 --> 13:04.415
Stop hitting yourself.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.550
Why are you
hitting yourself?

13:05.652 --> 13:06.718
Ow! Ouch!

13:07.020 --> 13:08.587
Cut it out, Pharynx!

13:09.389 --> 13:10.488
They're right, you know.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.956
You need to have
tougher skin.

13:14.827 --> 13:20.098
Awwww. That was a really sweet
story...until the end.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.868
I know Pharynx loved
me, in his own way.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.570
And I know there's
still good in him.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.439
That's why I keep
sticking up for him.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.241
Anyway, what did you
want to talk to me about?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.877
Me? No...

13:32.979 --> 13:35.347
But Starlight has
something she'd--

13:35.949 --> 13:38.316
Actually, Thorax, um...

13:38.418 --> 13:39.117
never mind.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.519
Come on, Trixie, we've
got a... thing to do.

13:44.056 --> 13:45.423
What are you doing?

13:45.725 --> 13:47.725
I thought we agreed
you'd tell Thorax

13:47.827 --> 13:49.961
he had to kick his
brother out of the hive.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.763
Maybe we don't have to.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.764
Get Pharynx and meet me
at the hive entrance.

13:53.866 --> 13:54.899
I'll explain everything.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.437
And how am I supposed to
know where Pharynx is?

13:59.739 --> 14:00.839
I just saw
Pharynx.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.375
Oh. Well, that was easy.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.651
We'll just use one
problem to solve another.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.119
I switched the trail
of plants around

14:15.221 --> 14:16.421
to lure the Maulwurf here.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.456
The changelings may not be
able to stop it anymore,

14:18.558 --> 14:20.058
but Pharynx certainly can.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.860
When it attacks, he'll
save his brother,

14:21.962 --> 14:23.361
showing everypony
his good side.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.430
The others will accept him
and Pharynx will finally

14:25.532 --> 14:28.800
let love and friendship into
his life and transform!

14:29.702 --> 14:30.535
Wow.

14:30.737 --> 14:31.402
I know, right?

14:31.504 --> 14:32.737
Great idea.

14:34.139 --> 14:35.006
Where's Pharynx?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.240
He's gone.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.709
Gone like gone to
the throne room?

14:39.011 --> 14:40.111
Gone like gone.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.481
One of the changelings said
Pharynx left the hive for good.

14:46.453 --> 14:50.288
[gasp] Then who's going to stop the
Dread Maulwurf I'm leading here!?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.231
Thorax! There you are!

15:00.533 --> 15:01.700
Pharynx is missing!

15:04.204 --> 15:05.904
Wait for it...

15:06.406 --> 15:08.439
--and the Dread Maulwurf
is coming this way!

15:10.844 --> 15:11.977
Told ya.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.945
That doesn't make any sense.

15:14.047 --> 15:17.216
The trail of plants should have
lead the Dread Maulwurf away.

15:17.318 --> 15:22.053
Heh... I might have re-laid them to
lead it back toward the hive.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.688
Why would you do that!?

15:23.990 --> 15:26.191
I thought if Pharynx saw you
were in danger, the loving,

15:26.293 --> 15:28.827
caring side of him would come
out when he protected you.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.228
But instead he's
out there alone

15:30.330 --> 15:32.797
somewhere between us and
that rampaging monster?

15:32.999 --> 15:34.365
I have to save him.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.467
I'm coming with you.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.268
Of course you are.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.937
This is all your fault.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.307
Oh, don't be too
hard on Starlight.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.542
Her heart was in
the right place.

15:44.744 --> 15:45.777
You're coming too!

15:46.079 --> 15:47.045
Oh. Right.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.414
I mean, I was gonna
volunteer anyway...

15:50.216 --> 15:51.416
Who else is coming?

15:54.587 --> 15:55.754
Ugh. Fine.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.759
Oh, sure, you could
all stay here.

16:00.861 --> 16:03.895
Not help Pharynx and he
won't bother you anymore.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.497
It's your choice.

16:05.699 --> 16:08.333
But remember when you
didn't have a choice.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.569
When you were forced
to obey Chrysalis.

16:10.971 --> 16:15.173
You might have been unstoppable,
but you weren't free to choose.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.941
And now you are.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.643
Because of Thorax.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.146
Well, it's his
brother out there.

16:21.248 --> 16:24.115
And now it's your chance to
prove you're just as strong

16:24.217 --> 16:27.252
embracing love as you
were feeding on it.

16:27.554 --> 16:31.456
Now is your chance to show what
changelings can really be.

16:31.658 --> 16:36.260
Not because you have to,
but because you choose to!

16:37.429 --> 16:41.533
That was an amazingly
epic speech, Starlight.

16:41.735 --> 16:44.068
I just can't believe not
a single changeling

16:44.170 --> 16:45.570
was moved by it.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.005
I can't blame them.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.108
If he wasn't my brother, I
don't think I'd be here.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.977
We're going to have to face
the Maulwurf by ourselves.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.412
Maybe it'll be long gone

16:54.514 --> 16:56.281
and we'll find Pharynx
out here alone.

17:01.054 --> 17:01.953
Or maybe not.

17:15.001 --> 17:15.867
Pharynx!

17:16.169 --> 17:17.302
What are you doing here?

17:17.604 --> 17:18.836
I'm here to save you!

17:20.272 --> 17:21.206
Get out of here!

17:21.608 --> 17:22.607
Let me handle this!

17:23.209 --> 17:24.642
We're not leaving you!

17:35.388 --> 17:38.456
Ahh. I may have forgot to mention in
my letters that Maulwurfs

17:38.558 --> 17:40.124
have really thick hides.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.865
I thought you said you
could beat this thing!

17:47.067 --> 17:49.067
Yeah, with the
rest of the swarm.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.301
Not alone!

17:50.903 --> 17:52.570
Changeling: Good thing you're not alone!

17:56.342 --> 17:58.543
I told you it was
an epic speech.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.359
It's no use!

18:14.561 --> 18:16.527
We're out of practice
and he's too tough!

18:21.334 --> 18:22.433
And strong.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.803
Too bad we can't get
it to fight itself.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.171
That's it!

18:26.473 --> 18:27.972
Thorax! Remember
when we were young

18:28.074 --> 18:29.541
and I made you hit yourself?

18:30.143 --> 18:32.811
Now is not the time to
make fun of me, Pharynx!

18:33.513 --> 18:36.614
Oh! Right! Of course!

18:39.586 --> 18:40.852
Why are you
hitting yourself?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.320
Why are you
hitting yourself?

18:42.422 --> 18:43.822
Why are you
hitting yourself?

18:44.424 --> 18:45.323
Yeah, Maulwurf.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.424
Why are you hitting yourself?

18:48.227 --> 18:50.260
Why are you hitting
yourself, huh? Huh? Huh?

18:56.036 --> 18:57.769
Oooh. That looks
like it hurts.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.774
We did it! It's gone!

19:08.081 --> 19:09.380
What were you
doing out here?

19:09.682 --> 19:11.882
Leaving. I'm done
with all of you.

19:12.084 --> 19:12.784
Oh.

19:13.086 --> 19:16.220
It's just, why bother
fighting the Maulwurf then?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.589
You could have
left it alone.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.091
Well, I couldn't just
let it attack you!

19:20.493 --> 19:23.227
But I thought you were done
with us and you didn't care.

19:23.529 --> 19:24.529
I never said that!

19:24.731 --> 19:26.931
The hive is the thing
I care about most.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.000
Well, you certainly
don't act like it.

19:29.102 --> 19:32.670
Well, I'm sorry if I don't get
excited about pretty flowers

19:32.772 --> 19:34.505
and Feelings Circles and-

19:34.607 --> 19:36.207
It's a Feelings Forum.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.443
Whatever. It
doesn't matter.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.111
Even if I do care
about the hive,

19:40.213 --> 19:42.714
I obviously don't have
a place there anymore.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.916
Actually, you do.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.585
Because we've been wrong.

19:46.687 --> 19:49.320
Um. The hive may be a
gentler, nicer place...

19:49.622 --> 19:52.490
But that doesn't mean we won't
have to defend ourselves.

19:53.092 --> 19:53.892
Clearly.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.695
And who better to help us do
that than the only changeling

19:57.797 --> 19:59.564
who never stopped
protecting us?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.503
You all... want
me to stay?

20:05.705 --> 20:08.573
Unless you still want
to leave the hive.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.008
Why would I want that?

20:10.210 --> 20:11.242
I love the hive!

20:25.892 --> 20:26.958
He did it!

20:27.160 --> 20:28.527
He transformed!

20:29.429 --> 20:31.362
I always knew you
had it in you!

20:31.664 --> 20:34.265
Really? Because I thought you
said I was a lost cause

20:34.367 --> 20:36.634
and you were going to tell
Thorax he should kick me out.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.804
Oh! Starlight!

20:40.106 --> 20:41.940
How could you say that?

20:42.242 --> 20:43.808
Ah! Wha? That's...

20:43.910 --> 20:45.443
I-I mean...

20:45.545 --> 20:46.211
but you...

20:47.113 --> 20:49.681
Lucky for us, you
weren't a lost cause.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.717
Lucky for me, you
didn't give up on me.

20:56.689 --> 21:00.825
So... Glad everything
worked out.

21:00.927 --> 21:04.061
Yeah. Let's talk about how you
not only lead the Maulwurf

21:04.163 --> 21:07.266
to the hive, but also drove
my brother away from it?

21:08.368 --> 21:11.336
I am so sorry about that.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.772
But I would like to point out
that my admittedly terrible plan

21:14.974 --> 21:17.442
did bring everything
together in the end... huh?

21:17.844 --> 21:19.610
Hey, do you guys want
to hear the story

21:19.712 --> 21:21.813
about how I used to make
Thorax hit himself?

21:22.015 --> 21:23.848
Oh! Absolutely. Yes. Right now!

21:24.350 --> 21:26.250
Well, when we were young,

21:26.352 --> 21:28.552
every changeling wanted
to be a warrior.

21:28.754 --> 21:29.988
Except for Thorax...

21:30.090 --> 21:32.890
He was a little weak..
but I had to protect...
