00:03.760 --> 00:05.330
<i>La-la-la-la-la.</i>

00:05.520 --> 00:08.340
<i>La-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la-la.</i>

00:09.200 --> 00:10.880
This is gonna be
so great, Gummy!

00:10.980 --> 00:14.740
We have absolutely nothing
to do today except bake!

00:16.160 --> 00:17.640
I've been waiting for
just the right time

00:17.640 --> 00:19.740
to finally try Granny
Pie's super special

00:19.740 --> 00:22.420
triple chocolate fifteen-layer
marjolaine recipe!

00:22.420 --> 00:24.080
It's gonna be amazing!

00:27.180 --> 00:30.120
Let's see: nutty meringue,
chocolate ganache,

00:30.120 --> 00:32.460
praline and nuts,
cocoa-flavored buttercream...

00:34.180 --> 00:39.320
An hour per layer; that's 15
hours of pure baking bliss!

00:43.120 --> 00:46.260
OK, Gummy, I think we're ready
to start prepping the second layer.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.200
Oh my gosh!

00:50.200 --> 00:51.260
My Cutie Mark!

00:52.100 --> 00:53.420
You
know what this means?

00:55.050 --> 00:56.480
The map!

00:59.720 --> 01:00.840
Uh, Gummy?

01:01.040 --> 01:02.190
Could you take over for a bit?

01:02.500 --> 01:03.780
Hopefully this'll be quick.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.440
I'll just measure the
baking powder for you.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.900
And when the first
layer cools,

01:10.000 --> 01:11.840
you can drizzle some of
the ganache over it.

01:12.860 --> 01:15.860
And don't forget to beat the
egg whites for the merengue.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.320
I know you can do this, Gummy.

01:19.320 --> 01:22.000
You're the best alligator
baker I've ever met.

01:37.040 --> 01:43.840
Hearing Impaired Subtitles by YayPonies
We have Muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

02:11.760 --> 02:13.160
This is so exciting!

02:13.560 --> 02:16.200
The map is summoning
you to Griffonstone!

02:16.440 --> 02:18.380
The very heart of
the griffon kingdom!

02:18.680 --> 02:20.140
I don't know if
either you have read

02:20.140 --> 02:23.240
"Bygone Griffons of Greatness,"
but griffons were known to be--

02:23.240 --> 02:24.920
Rude, insensitive bullies?

02:26.120 --> 02:27.020
You mean Gilda?

02:27.320 --> 02:28.740
Yeah, I mean Gilda!

02:29.060 --> 02:30.100
When she came to Ponyville,

02:30.100 --> 02:32.450
she was a total jerk
to all my friends!

02:32.690 --> 02:34.250
Especially Pinkie Pie!

02:34.550 --> 02:36.480
She was a bit of a party pooper.

02:36.850 --> 02:37.640
Mm-hm.

02:38.150 --> 02:39.900
So maybe Gilda
was a little rude.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.990
You still get to
go to Griffonstone!

02:42.290 --> 02:45.560
And according to this book, it
has a rich, fascinating history.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.960
In ancient times, griffons
were known to be as greedy

02:49.960 --> 02:53.260
as dragons, always hoarding
their bits and other treasures.

02:53.630 --> 02:55.660
But all that changed
when King Grover

02:55.660 --> 02:58.540
found the mysterious
golden idol of Boreas!

02:58.910 --> 03:01.020
Legend says the idol
of Boreas was made

03:01.020 --> 03:02.840
from the dust of
golden sunsets,

03:03.180 --> 03:05.470
blown across the mountains
by the north winds.

03:05.780 --> 03:07.420
Possessing the idol of Boreas

03:07.420 --> 03:09.280
filled the griffons'
hearts with pride.

03:09.650 --> 03:12.430
It's said that that one great
treasure is responsible

03:12.430 --> 03:16.270
for turning Griffonstone into the most
majestic kingdom of all the land!

03:16.470 --> 03:19.850
And why do you care so much
about griffons, anyway?

03:20.250 --> 03:22.660
It was actually Gilda's
visit that made me curious.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.420
So I picked up "Bygone
Griffons of Greatness"

03:25.640 --> 03:27.080
and I've been hooked ever since.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.180
And now...

03:29.120 --> 03:31.060
Now you two get
to see Griffonstone

03:31.060 --> 03:32.460
with your very own eyes.

03:32.760 --> 03:33.140
Huh?

03:33.540 --> 03:34.820
Just me and Rainbow Dash?

03:35.200 --> 03:38.180
Hey, you can totally take
my place if you want.

03:38.860 --> 03:41.220
I still had half
a nap to finish.

03:41.580 --> 03:42.860
Why don't you just come with us?

03:42.860 --> 03:45.190
I mean, you are the
Princess of Friendship!

03:45.500 --> 03:48.820
No no, if the map wanted me to
go to the coolest kingdom

03:48.820 --> 03:50.620
in all of Equestria
and tour the palace

03:50.620 --> 03:53.160
and see the actual idol that
unites an entire species,

03:53.160 --> 03:56.630
which would be super amazing,
I'm sure it would have said so.

03:58.660 --> 04:01.340
You two can handle whatever
the issue is just fine.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.900
I'll stay here and do important
princessy things... I guess.

04:06.300 --> 04:07.700
Well then, c'mon Dashie!

04:07.880 --> 04:09.560
We're goin' to Griffonstone!

04:10.500 --> 04:11.320
Fine.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.980
That's the spirit!

04:23.540 --> 04:24.760
Whatcha reading, Rainbow?

04:25.800 --> 04:28.040
Twilight literally
wrote a book

04:28.040 --> 04:29.820
on what we need to
do in Griffonstone.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.080
You mean like a guide on how to figure
out what problem we're supposed to fix?

04:33.480 --> 04:34.780
And then some.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.540
It's like Twilight
herself in book form!

04:37.960 --> 04:40.100
"Always carry plenty of bits.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.960
The griffons are
sure to help you

04:41.960 --> 04:44.040
as long as you
share the wealth."

04:51.620 --> 04:52.600
Can I borrow some bits?

04:56.180 --> 04:57.980
<i>Upon
arriving at Griffon Gorge,</i>

04:57.980 --> 05:00.240
<i>be sure to pause and
cast your eyes northerly</i>

05:00.240 --> 05:02.220
<i>up the Hyperborean Mountains,</i>

05:02.220 --> 05:04.900
<i>taking in the breathtaking
beauty of Griffonstone.</i>

05:05.260 --> 05:08.400
<i>Once in Griffonstone proper,
go immediately to the palace</i>

05:08.540 --> 05:10.240
<i>and introduce
yourself to the King.</i>

05:10.600 --> 05:13.480
<i>"Bygone Griffons of Greatness"
was written a long time ago</i>

05:13.820 --> 05:16.660
<i>and it ends with the coronation of
the fourteenth king of the griffons,</i>

05:16.660 --> 05:17.620
<i>King Guto.</i>

05:17.940 --> 05:20.220
<i>I have no idea
who's in charge now.</i>

05:20.540 --> 05:22.860
<i>Tell the King you've been sent
by the Princess of Friendship</i>

05:23.120 --> 05:25.150
<i>and you're there to help
with some sort of problem.</i>

05:25.620 --> 05:27.620
<i>If for some reason
the King can't help,</i>

05:28.020 --> 05:29.990
<i>I'd try the Griffonstone
library next.</i>

05:30.360 --> 05:33.440
<i>It's a little known secret that
if you befriend a librarian,</i>

05:33.440 --> 05:35.520
<i>you can usually
find out anything.</i>

05:35.880 --> 05:39.060
<i>Plus, as a bonus, there's a
statue of King Grover outside!</i>

05:39.440 --> 05:40.120
<i> Photo op!</i>

05:40.480 --> 05:43.260
<i> And don't forget to sample
some famous Griffon Scones!</i>

05:43.520 --> 05:45.270
<i>They're supposed to be the best!</i>

05:45.700 --> 05:47.500
Aw, Twilight should
have come along.

05:47.740 --> 05:50.620
Then she could have seen first
hoof that Griffonstone is...

05:53.980 --> 05:55.880
...a total dump!

06:03.020 --> 06:07.140
Ugh, maybe the map should have
called Rarity instead of us.

06:08.220 --> 06:09.640
Excuse me, sir?

06:10.720 --> 06:13.360
This is Griffonstone, right?

06:16.500 --> 06:17.960
Well, that wasn't
very nice.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.240
See? These griffons are exactly
what I thought they'd be.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.840
Maybe we should just
find the palace

06:22.840 --> 06:24.480
so we can ask the
king what's going on.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.240
We don't have a
king, loosers.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.080
Hello, Gilda.

06:30.860 --> 06:31.900
Dash.

06:32.140 --> 06:33.020
Pinkie!

06:33.500 --> 06:34.740
What're you
doing here?

06:35.040 --> 06:36.460
Uh, I'm a griffon?

06:36.660 --> 06:38.440
What's your excuse, dweebs?

06:38.440 --> 06:41.200
Hey! These dweebs are here
to help Griffonstone!

06:41.500 --> 06:42.880
Help it what?

06:43.280 --> 06:45.460
Well, we're not really sure.

06:45.460 --> 06:48.060
But it involves a map and Cutie
Marks and a problem and--

06:48.060 --> 06:49.340
Bored now.

06:49.980 --> 06:51.140
Well, if you don't have a king,

06:51.140 --> 06:53.520
can you at least tell us
where the idol of Boreas is?

06:53.800 --> 06:56.960
Ha-ha! Don't tell me you really
believe in that thing.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.800
You'd
better believe in it!

07:04.720 --> 07:09.100
The idol was the best thing
to ever happen to us griffons!

07:09.480 --> 07:10.720
Oh, great!

07:10.880 --> 07:13.000
Now you got Grampa
Gruff started.

07:14.180 --> 07:19.100
I'll tell you the whole
tragic tale...heh heh heh.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.880
For a couple of bits.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.900
The first griffon
king, King Grover,

07:33.040 --> 07:38.400
united our kind like we've never
been united before or since.

07:39.060 --> 07:43.980
And he did it all with that
incredible idol of Boreas.

07:46.060 --> 07:51.220
That idol brought pride to the
heart of every griffon that saw it.

07:51.860 --> 07:57.140
From one king to the next,
Griffonstone and our golden idol

07:57.400 --> 08:01.560
were the envy of
all other species.

08:02.120 --> 08:05.300
It held us together,
gave us an identity.

08:05.740 --> 08:09.860
Right up until the
reign of King Guto.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.880
That's when Arimaspi came.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.340
To steal our griffon treasure.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.320
King Guto tried
to fight him off,

08:20.480 --> 08:23.880
but Arimaspi managed to
get away with the idol.

08:31.340 --> 08:35.500
They say when our treasure
fell into the Abysmal Abyss,

08:35.740 --> 08:38.400
our pride went with it.

08:38.920 --> 08:42.380
King Guto was the last
king of Griffonstone

08:42.620 --> 08:44.880
and we all lived
miserably ever after.

08:44.880 --> 08:45.560
The end.

08:45.980 --> 08:48.640
That was the saddest story ever.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.180
Oh, well ... tough
tailfeathers! No refunds!

08:53.240 --> 08:56.140
No wonder Twilight's book ended
with the coronation of King Guto.

08:56.300 --> 08:59.400
Who would want to record
a history that sad?

08:59.580 --> 09:00.840
It's not sad!

09:02.120 --> 09:03.620
Do we look sad to you?

09:08.120 --> 09:10.600
Pinkie, I think I know
why the map sent us here!

09:10.820 --> 09:12.500
We need to find
the idol of Boreas

09:12.600 --> 09:15.240
and bring glory and pride
back to Griffonstone!

09:15.380 --> 09:15.980
Ha ha.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.520
Here we go, typical
pony hero complex.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.840
None of us care about
that dumb old idol.

09:21.980 --> 09:22.820
Don't you get it?

09:23.120 --> 09:27.320
We don't care about anything
and that's the way we like it.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.000
I think Rainbow Dash is right.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.260
The map sent us here to
fix some sort of problem.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.320
The only problem
Griffonstone has is you!

09:39.320 --> 09:41.140
Well, I don't care
what she says.

09:41.300 --> 09:42.400
We're going to
find that treasure,

09:42.580 --> 09:45.420
make Griffonstone cool again,
and get back to Ponyville.

09:45.420 --> 09:45.940
C'mon!

09:46.760 --> 09:49.040
Wait, Rainbow Dash, what
about Twilight's advice?

09:49.500 --> 09:51.360
What, taking a
bunch of pictures?

09:51.640 --> 09:53.940
She mentioned finding
answers at the library.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.260
Knock yourself out.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.740
But when you get bored
with Twilight's tour book,

09:59.020 --> 10:01.960
I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss
finding the idol of Boreas.

10:07.260 --> 10:10.700
I'm here to find your missing
idol and save Griffonstone!

10:15.760 --> 10:17.940
Uh, I'll need some
rope, a grappling hook,

10:17.940 --> 10:20.320
and a guide to take me
down to the Abysmal Abyss.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.120
And I'll need some bits.

10:27.740 --> 10:29.040
Hey, Gilda!

10:29.480 --> 10:32.320
Word on the street is that
Griffonstone has an amazing

10:32.320 --> 10:34.060
library chock-full of answers!

10:34.200 --> 10:36.120
Word on what street?

10:36.360 --> 10:37.860
OK, maybe not this street.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.060
But on other streets, your
library is the talk of the town.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.680
The library's right there

10:42.680 --> 10:43.920
so why don't you go inside

10:43.920 --> 10:45.160
AND LEAVE ME ALONE!

10:53.980 --> 10:56.800
Maybe it's good that
Twilight didn't come.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.280
It's sad what happened
to your town, King.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.100
But Rainbow Dash can't be right.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.180
This can't all be because
of a missing hunk of gold.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.180
"You're right, Pinkie.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.300
And you've got amazing hair."

11:13.600 --> 11:16.780
Aw, King Grover,
you old charmer.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.740
I know what Griffonstone needs!

11:28.100 --> 11:29.300
Fewer ponies?

11:30.040 --> 11:31.100
A song!

11:31.280 --> 11:33.400
I've got a super
song about smiling

11:33.400 --> 11:36.660
that's sure to make even the
most grumpy griffon grin!

11:37.940 --> 11:38.900
You can't sing here.

11:40.260 --> 11:44.260
But how do you break into uplifting
musical numbers with no singing?

11:44.480 --> 11:46.840
Yeah, that's Griffonstone's
biggest problem.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.900
Lack of uplifting
musical numbers.

11:49.180 --> 11:51.580
Well, if I can't sing,
how 'bout a party?

11:51.820 --> 11:54.880
If there's one thing these griffons
need, it's some good cheer.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.220
Where's your party store?

11:58.040 --> 11:58.980
No party store?

11:59.320 --> 12:00.600
Aw. How about cake?

12:00.760 --> 12:02.220
Nothing cheers
folks up like cake!

12:02.220 --> 12:03.120
Where's your bakery?

12:05.180 --> 12:06.100
NO SINGING?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.460
NO PARTY STORE?

12:07.460 --> 12:08.640
NO BAKERY?

12:08.880 --> 12:10.320
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

12:10.480 --> 12:13.540
You're welcome to
leave at any time.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.300
Well, that just takes the cake.

12:18.580 --> 12:19.460
Wait, no.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.560
It can't take the cake
cause there is no cake!

12:21.760 --> 12:22.660
Or muffins!

12:22.880 --> 12:24.400
Or Griffon Scones!

12:24.720 --> 12:26.220
Oh, we got Griffon Scones.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.500
That's my specialty.

12:27.660 --> 12:28.780
I'll buy one!

12:31.460 --> 12:32.620
Bits first.

12:40.860 --> 12:41.580
Well?

12:43.700 --> 12:45.240
What, you like it?

12:45.360 --> 12:47.800
That's my Grampa
Gruff's secret recipe.

12:49.320 --> 12:52.060
Ow! I think I broke a tooth.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.640
Well, whatever, no refunds.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.480
I don't even care anyway.

12:56.740 --> 12:58.020
I just want to sell
enough of these

12:58.020 --> 13:00.040
so I can leave this lousy town.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.680
I can help you with that!

13:07.200 --> 13:09.820
Uh, you think you could
tighten the strap on my helmet?

13:10.260 --> 13:11.720
Can you give me more bits?

13:13.120 --> 13:14.240
Never mind.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.120
I got it.

13:15.780 --> 13:18.060
So how deep is this abyss?

13:18.460 --> 13:19.940
How deep are your pockets?

13:20.100 --> 13:23.220
Don't you griffons ever talk
about anything but bits?

13:23.560 --> 13:25.080
Give me some bits
and I'll answer.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.520
No wonder Gilda's
such a delight.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.860
Grampa Gruff's recipe is good,

13:32.080 --> 13:34.120
but it's missing one
important ingredient.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.380
Don't tell me...friendship?

13:36.900 --> 13:37.920
Uh, no.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.300
Baking powder.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.960
Lucky for you I never
leave home without it!

13:42.880 --> 13:45.460
Now just pop those in the oven
and you'll have Griffon Scones

13:45.460 --> 13:47.000
worth their weight in gold!

13:50.880 --> 13:51.440
Oof!

13:52.900 --> 13:53.520
Greta!

13:56.240 --> 13:57.280
AH-HA!

13:57.620 --> 13:58.760
I saw that, Gilda!

13:58.860 --> 14:00.680
You may act like a
gruff, grumbling griffon,

14:00.800 --> 14:02.660
but inside you're
gracious and great!

14:02.920 --> 14:04.040
What are you talking about?

14:04.380 --> 14:06.780
You just helped your friend
up when she got knocked down.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.140
What, her?

14:08.580 --> 14:10.180
Greta's just some
griffon I know.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.240
We don't have friends here.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.360
I did have a friend once,

14:16.300 --> 14:17.680
but you saw how that turned out.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.080
Oh my gosh!

14:22.220 --> 14:23.780
I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!

14:24.080 --> 14:24.780
See ya.

14:29.340 --> 14:31.540
You sure we can't just fly down?

14:33.620 --> 14:34.160
Whoa!

14:35.140 --> 14:35.880
Never mind.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.660
Totally got my answer there.

14:42.540 --> 14:45.620
Just gotta find that Golden
Idol and get out of this place!

14:49.140 --> 14:50.300
Aaaaah!

14:50.920 --> 14:51.780
Aaaaah!

14:51.780 --> 14:52.140
Oof!

14:52.700 --> 14:53.520
Oh! Oww!

14:53.760 --> 14:54.080
Ooh!

14:54.320 --> 14:54.940
My hoof!

14:55.440 --> 14:56.300
Help!

14:56.300 --> 14:57.540
Throw me another rope!

14:57.760 --> 14:58.820
You got bits?

15:03.320 --> 15:03.840
Wait!

15:04.320 --> 15:06.220
HELP!

15:24.920 --> 15:26.540
AHHHHH!

15:26.640 --> 15:27.800
There you are!

15:28.420 --> 15:29.980
Forget about finding the idol.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.700
I figured out how to solve
Griffonstone's real problem!

15:33.020 --> 15:34.140
SCONES!

15:34.920 --> 15:36.960
PINKIE PIE, YOU GET BACK HERE!

15:37.680 --> 15:38.600
Yeah?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.980
Can you throw down
a rope or something?

15:41.460 --> 15:42.240
Lemme look.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.820
One rope, comin' up!

15:51.240 --> 15:52.060
We need help!

15:53.700 --> 15:55.160
Don't go anywhere!

15:57.000 --> 15:58.460
Where does she
think I'm gonna go?

15:59.200 --> 15:59.600
Unh!

16:00.060 --> 16:01.500
I hope I don't go anywhere!

16:07.960 --> 16:10.540
Rainbow Dash is stuck
on a ledge in the Abysmal Abyss

16:10.700 --> 16:12.820
and I need your
help to save her!

16:13.080 --> 16:14.080
Not my problem.

16:14.260 --> 16:15.560
Of course it's your problem!

16:15.560 --> 16:16.700
She's your friend!

16:17.200 --> 16:18.080
Used to be.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.280
Can't you remember when she was?

16:21.100 --> 16:21.660
Yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:22.840
Of course.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.300
Doesn't that griffon know that
she's supposed to fly

16:38.300 --> 16:40.660
at the Junior
Speedsters Flight Camp?

16:41.680 --> 16:43.980
Maybe she just doesn't
want to make you look bad.

16:46.180 --> 16:46.700
Hey there!

16:46.960 --> 16:47.980
I'm Rainbow Dash.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.460
And you are...?

16:49.860 --> 16:52.680
Uh, G-Gilda?

16:53.200 --> 16:54.560
You sure about that?

16:56.260 --> 16:57.640
Stick with me, Gilda,

16:57.820 --> 17:00.280
and those guys won't
give you any more guff!

17:04.780 --> 17:06.680
Whoa! You're awesome!

17:07.880 --> 17:09.620
You too, Rainbow Dash!

17:14.480 --> 17:17.640
Well, Gilda, let's show
these guys how it's done.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.080
Junior Speedsters are our lives!

17:23.080 --> 17:25.520
Sky bound soars
and daring dives!

17:25.520 --> 17:27.820
Junior Speedsters
it's our quest,

17:27.820 --> 17:30.460
to someday be the VERY BEST!

17:33.780 --> 17:34.440
Fine.

17:34.680 --> 17:35.380
I'll help her.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.320
But that doesn't
make me her friend.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.420
Duly noted.

17:39.940 --> 17:42.280
Except it does.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.360
Hang on, loser!

17:50.980 --> 17:52.820
I'm coming!

17:54.040 --> 17:56.760
What took you so long, doofus?

18:02.580 --> 18:03.700
RAINBOW DASH!

18:03.800 --> 18:05.420
I'M COMIN' FOR YA!

18:07.180 --> 18:08.640
AAAAAAHHHH!

18:12.020 --> 18:12.720
Gotcha!

18:15.340 --> 18:16.740
Hold on, you two!

18:18.540 --> 18:19.060
Huh?

18:26.100 --> 18:28.080
The idol of Boreas!

18:33.580 --> 18:34.560
I'm slipping!

18:37.480 --> 18:39.140
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

18:53.320 --> 18:54.040
The idol!

18:55.060 --> 18:58.540
You're more important to me
than some dumb chunk of gold!

19:01.140 --> 19:02.020
Hugging later!

19:02.020 --> 19:03.660
Climbing NOW!

19:10.280 --> 19:13.060
I'm really sorry about
how I treated you two.

19:13.540 --> 19:14.460
Thanks, Gilda.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.440
Apology accepted.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.100
And I'm just sorry we
didn't get your idol back.

19:19.280 --> 19:22.380
Now we'll never be able to
solve Griffonstone's problem.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.720
That's what I was
trying to tell you!

19:25.060 --> 19:27.840
The map didn't send us here to
find the lost idol of Boreas.

19:28.020 --> 19:30.400
It sent us here to replace
it with something better!

19:30.800 --> 19:33.460
Nothing's better than
gold to a griffon.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.960
That's because you
don't have friendship.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.500
If you can learn to care
about each other again,

19:38.780 --> 19:42.780
Griffonstone could be a mightier
kingdom than it ever was before!

19:43.040 --> 19:45.540
And you don't need some
golden idol to do that.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.760
You just need each other.

19:48.340 --> 19:49.260
Whoa, Pinkie.

19:49.260 --> 19:51.740
That was...really sappy.

19:52.360 --> 19:53.680
Eh, what can I say?

19:53.860 --> 19:54.920
That's how I roll.

19:56.880 --> 19:57.820
Go on, Gilda.

19:58.060 --> 19:59.300
Go make a friend.

20:05.260 --> 20:06.400
I don't know, Pinkie.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.400
You really think these
griffons are up for this?

20:08.720 --> 20:10.820
We aren't exactly in
Ponyville, you know.

20:16.920 --> 20:17.420
OK.

20:17.680 --> 20:21.320
So she was really weirded out
until I gave her the scone.

20:21.560 --> 20:24.680
Then she tried it and
said it tasted good!

20:25.080 --> 20:29.080
That's the first nice thing
any griffon's ever said to me!

20:31.160 --> 20:32.060
Whoa, Pinkie!

20:32.340 --> 20:34.760
I guess that really was the
problem we needed to solve.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.760
Baking powder makes baked
goods and friendships

20:37.760 --> 20:39.100
fluffy and delicious!

20:41.780 --> 20:43.260
Well, we better
be headin' home.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.100
What? Y-y-you want me to spread
friendship here by myself?

20:47.240 --> 20:48.420
How am I supposed to do that?

20:48.540 --> 20:51.140
I haven't even made
one single friend yet!

20:51.380 --> 20:52.380
No, you haven't.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.420
You've made two.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.500
Hugging!

20:55.740 --> 20:57.340
Hugging now!

20:59.080 --> 21:01.660
But you'll come back
and visit, right?

21:02.100 --> 21:03.940
Just try and stop us!

21:14.940 --> 21:17.340
See you later,
you old charmer.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.960
Uh, Pinkie?

21:19.100 --> 21:20.220
Who are you
talking to?

21:20.520 --> 21:23.820
Nopony! Come on, let's go
home and see how Gummy did

21:23.820 --> 21:25.900
with Granny Pie's
marjolaine recipe...
