WEBVTT

00:07.575 --> 00:08.174
Hm.

00:16.716 --> 00:18.117
Ah, thank you!

00:18.219 --> 00:19.418
You must be new.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.352
I'm Apple Bloom.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.555
I'm Grand Pear.

00:22.957 --> 00:23.955
Welcome to Ponyville!

00:24.157 --> 00:26.992
Heh. You mean, welcome
<i> back</i> to Ponyville!

00:27.094 --> 00:29.094
Grand Pear was
originally from here

00:29.196 --> 00:32.297
before he opened his famous
pear jam store in VanHoover!

00:32.499 --> 00:34.500
Really? Why'd you move back?

00:34.802 --> 00:38.905
I uh, well, I needed
a change of pace.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.339
Ah.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.108
This is delicious!

00:44.779 --> 00:46.478
I can't believe I've
gone my whole life

00:46.580 --> 00:47.580
without ever having this!

00:48.082 --> 00:48.981
Glad you like it.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.182
How much?

00:51.084 --> 00:51.951
Nah.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.954
Wow, thanks, Mr.
Grand Pear, sir!

00:55.956 --> 00:57.390
It was real nice meetin' you!

01:05.732 --> 01:07.233
Glad you're back, sugar cube!

01:07.435 --> 01:09.602
Just in time for
breakfast-for-dinner!

01:10.204 --> 01:13.372
I got the perfect topper for
flapjacks at the market today!

01:16.010 --> 01:17.243
PEAR JAM?!

01:17.845 --> 01:19.044
What were you thinking!?

01:21.682 --> 01:22.748
Quick, hide it!

01:26.619 --> 01:27.319
Huh?

02:08.295 --> 02:09.261
What's the big deal?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.297
It's just Pear Jam!

02:11.599 --> 02:12.865
The big deal
is that there

02:12.967 --> 02:14.299
is a long-
standing feud

02:14.401 --> 02:16.035
between the Apples
and the Pears!

02:16.537 --> 02:17.737
Eee-yup!

02:18.239 --> 02:18.938
Why?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.273
Why!?

02:20.875 --> 02:23.909
Well, uh, actually
I- I'm not really sure.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.511
You have any idea, Big Mac?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.880
Uuuuh, nope.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.049
Then I guess we
should ask Granny?

02:30.351 --> 02:31.317
Ask me what?

02:33.386 --> 02:35.821
Uhh, what goes better with
apple fritter flapjacks,

02:35.923 --> 02:37.689
caramel syrup or praline?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.491
Pffft! Praline!

02:41.094 --> 02:43.729
Oh ho ho, that smells
great, Applejack!

02:43.931 --> 02:45.631
I'm gonna wash
up for supper.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.566
Be right baaack.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.568
Listen, sugar cube.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.672
Anytime Big Mac and I ever
asked Granny about the feud

02:53.774 --> 02:56.876
or the Pears, she'd get so
upset she couldn't talk.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.577
Best not bring it up.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.582
OK... but that Grand Pear
was really nice to me,

03:03.684 --> 03:04.884
even though I'm an Apple.

03:04.986 --> 03:06.318
I wonder what happened.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.518
Me too.

03:07.820 --> 03:10.556
But if we can't ask Granny,
I don't know who--

03:11.358 --> 03:12.925
We can ask Goldie Delicious!

03:13.127 --> 03:16.462
If anypony knows about the
feud, it's the family historian!

03:17.164 --> 03:19.131
I'm in! Whaddya
say, Big Mac?

03:19.333 --> 03:21.100
Sibling trip first
thing tomorrow?

03:21.502 --> 03:22.501
Eee-yup!

03:36.983 --> 03:39.451
Now that's how you
make an entrance!

03:39.653 --> 03:40.751
Or is it an exit?

03:40.853 --> 03:44.423
[chuckle] Well, anyway, it's so
wonderful to see you three!

03:44.625 --> 03:46.559
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

03:47.461 --> 03:50.596
Well, Goldie, we were hoping you
could tell us about the... uh...

03:51.098 --> 03:53.232
feud with the Apples
and the Pears.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.701
Oh...oh, dear!

03:55.903 --> 03:57.903
Does Granny Smith
know you're here?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.103
No, ma'am.

03:59.405 --> 04:03.075
But.. I ran into Grand Pear
yesterday and he was real nice.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.444
Maybe the feud was a
misunderstanding or something

04:05.646 --> 04:06.779
and we can fix it?

04:07.581 --> 04:10.682
Hmm. Well, I don't know
about that, little one.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.818
But.. if it's the
story you're after,

04:12.920 --> 04:14.754
I suppose you have
a right to know.

04:15.156 --> 04:17.390
Let's see here, I got a stack
of books here someplace.

04:18.092 --> 04:21.126
Oh! Apple family history
volume one-thirty-seven.

04:22.562 --> 04:23.195
Here we are!

04:23.297 --> 04:24.830
Feud with the Bears.

04:25.332 --> 04:26.165
I mean Pears.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.301
My eyes ain't what
they used to be.

04:29.003 --> 04:32.037
A long time ago,
Sweet Apple Acres

04:32.139 --> 04:34.340
wasn't the only
farm in Ponyville.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.609
In fact, there was another
one just right next door..

04:39.846 --> 04:41.080
Come and get your apples!

04:41.382 --> 04:43.515
Nothing sweeter than
biting into a crisp apple

04:43.617 --> 04:45.551
on a beautiful fall day.

04:45.753 --> 04:49.088
Unless, of course, you could
bite into a juicy pear!

04:49.490 --> 04:50.788
Pfft! Please!

04:50.890 --> 04:52.824
Pears are just what happens
when you ain't no good

04:52.926 --> 04:54.560
at farming apples.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.362
Pears are nature's candy!

04:57.464 --> 04:59.498
Apples are.. sour,

04:59.900 --> 05:01.833
like the expression on
your face right now!

05:02.637 --> 05:04.035
<i> Goldie: And so it went.</i>

05:04.337 --> 05:07.039
<i> Granny and Grand Pear were</i>
<i> always at each other:</i>

05:07.241 --> 05:08.739
<i> Who was the best farmer?</i>

05:08.841 --> 05:10.439
<i> Who took better</i>
<i> care of their trees?</i>

05:10.541 --> 05:13.345
<i> If Granny read to</i>
<i> her trees at night...</i>

05:13.647 --> 05:16.915
"... And then the little
tree reached its branches

05:17.017 --> 05:20.686
up to the moon and the
moon said good night.

05:22.355 --> 05:25.157
<i> ... why then Grand Pear had</i>
<i> special blankets made</i>

05:25.259 --> 05:27.960
<i> for his trees so they</i>
<i> wouldn't get cold.</i>

05:28.462 --> 05:29.561
Good night, trees.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.764
I've got you covered.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.199
Mm hm.

05:41.709 --> 05:45.777
<i>In fact, all the Apples and the</i>
<i> Pears were rivals to the core.</i>

05:49.115 --> 05:51.350
<i> The only Apple and Pear</i>
<i> who ever got along</i>

05:51.452 --> 05:54.286
<i> were Bright Macintosh</i>
<i> and Pear Butter.</i>

05:55.988 --> 05:56.522
Psst.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.259
I'm not supposed
to talk to you.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.361
I'm not supposed to
talk to you either.

06:02.863 --> 06:06.131
My mom says if you hold a
buttercup under your chin,

06:06.233 --> 06:07.466
it'll make your
chin glow.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.933
But it doesn't
work on me.

06:09.135 --> 06:09.835
See?

06:11.570 --> 06:12.771
Does it work on me?

06:14.675 --> 06:16.308
It sure does, buttercup.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.412
Buttercup. I
like that name.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.614
<i> Applejack: Wait an</i>
<i> apple pickin' minute!</i>

06:22.916 --> 06:25.150
Bright Mac and Buttercup?

06:25.252 --> 06:26.852
Those are our parents names!

06:27.254 --> 06:29.320
Course, Buttercup was just
the nickname your father

06:29.422 --> 06:30.220
gave your mother.

06:30.322 --> 06:33.225
Pear Butter. Well, that
was her given name.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.661
Are you saying our
mother was a<i> Pear</i> !?

06:41.367 --> 06:43.735
So we are
half-Pear!?

06:44.437 --> 06:45.971
I can't
believe it!

06:46.173 --> 06:47.371
How did we
not know!?

06:47.673 --> 06:50.576
Well.. nopony called your
mother Pear Butter...

06:51.478 --> 06:53.545
And her cutie mark was a
preserve jar but pear butter

06:53.647 --> 06:55.080
don't look too much different
from apple butter...

06:55.182 --> 06:56.548
so no clues there.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.386
[sigh] Is there anything else you
can tell us about them?

07:01.488 --> 07:03.789
I know they loved
each other very much!

07:03.991 --> 07:06.925
They had that
magical, star-kissed,

07:07.127 --> 07:10.462
other side of a
rainbow kind of love.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.662
You couldn't be
around 'em too long..

07:12.964 --> 07:15.366
and not feel a little bit
lighter than air yourself.

07:16.970 --> 07:17.871
Anything else?

07:19.473 --> 07:22.340
I'd need volume one hundred
and thirty-eight for that.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.744
I'm sure I could wrangle it...

07:25.846 --> 07:27.346
in a couple days.

07:28.648 --> 07:29.915
That's all
right, Goldie.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.716
It was nice
just to hear--

07:31.818 --> 07:34.185
Ooh ooh! I just
remembered somethin'!

07:34.287 --> 07:36.054
Your dad and his
buddy, Burnt Oak,

07:36.156 --> 07:38.824
would get in all kinds of
trouble together as colts!

07:39.726 --> 07:40.792
Burnt Oak?

07:41.094 --> 07:42.761
The firewood salespony?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.629
I haven't seen
him in ages.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.599
He and your dad were thick
as thieves back in the day.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.800
Y'all should talk to him.

07:55.441 --> 07:58.009
Well, well, if it
isn't the Apples!

07:58.211 --> 07:59.611
What can I do for you?

07:59.713 --> 08:01.646
I know you're not
here for firewood.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.550
You've got more trees
than anypony in Ponyville!

08:05.252 --> 08:05.884
You're right.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.153
We're not here for that.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.089
Come to ask
about your dad?

08:10.491 --> 08:12.224
Uh, eeeyup.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.659
I wondered if you might.

08:14.861 --> 08:15.827
I hoped you would.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.262
It's nice to talk about him.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.799
We had a lot of laughs.

08:20.901 --> 08:21.899
In fact, this one time...

08:22.501 --> 08:25.236
<i> ... we were racing to see who</i>
<i> could till the fastest</i>

08:25.438 --> 08:27.672
<i> and Bright Mac was</i>
<i> leavin' me in the dust!</i>

08:27.874 --> 08:31.442
<i> He would've won too if he</i>
<i> wasn't so.. distracted.</i>

08:32.979 --> 08:33.879
Whoa!

08:42.788 --> 08:43.388
Oh!

08:46.325 --> 08:48.627
Pear Butter! What
did you do?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.495
I... I'm not sure.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.168
Bright Mac: She
didn't do it, sir.

08:56.292 --> 08:58.269
♪♪

08:58.370 --> 08:59.705
Excuse me?

09:00.707 --> 09:01.840
The water silo.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.174
It was my fault.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.947
You owe me a
new silo, boy.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.516
And you, come with me.

09:13.085 --> 09:16.988
No daughter of mine is gonna
make goo goo eyes at an Apple.

09:25.197 --> 09:26.765
Grand Pear never
would have known

09:26.867 --> 09:28.067
it was your
father's fault!

09:28.769 --> 09:30.602
But there was no way
he'd let your mother

09:30.704 --> 09:32.537
take the blame for
something he did.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.773
So Dad was super honest!

09:34.875 --> 09:37.476
Apple doesn't fall far from
the tree huh, Applejack?

09:38.911 --> 09:41.246
Your dad worked the
apple farm all day

09:41.348 --> 09:43.581
and then headed over to the
Pear's on his breaks

09:43.683 --> 09:45.116
to fix the water silo.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.585
I didn't see him for weeks!

09:46.687 --> 09:47.785
Not that he minded.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.022
Gave him a chance to
get to know your ma.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.057
Did you know our mom, too?

09:52.359 --> 09:54.526
Buttercup was a real
peach of a Pear

09:54.928 --> 09:56.294
but if you want to
know more about her,

09:56.396 --> 09:57.562
you should ask
Mrs. Cake.

09:58.898 --> 09:59.831
Mrs. Cake?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.733
She and your mom
were inseparable

10:01.835 --> 10:02.768
when they were fillies!

10:03.470 --> 10:04.302
Then let's go!

10:04.504 --> 10:05.337
Thanks, Burnt Oak.

10:09.308 --> 10:12.144
Er.. would it be OK if we
stopped by again sometime?

10:12.546 --> 10:13.745
To hear more stories?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.780
I'd like that very much.

10:22.389 --> 10:27.125
Well, cinnamon sugar on toast,
all three Apple siblings!

10:27.527 --> 10:29.193
Hi, Mrs. Cake. We heard you

10:29.295 --> 10:30.895
and our ma used
to be real good friends

10:30.997 --> 10:32.998
and we were hoping you could
tell us a bit about her.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.534
Oh, I would love to.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.969
I never knew the right
time to bring it up,

10:38.171 --> 10:40.571
but I'm so glad you came. Haha!

10:40.673 --> 10:44.242
Oh. For starters, did you all
know that it was your mom

10:44.344 --> 10:46.411
who convinced me
to pursue baking?

10:46.813 --> 10:49.147
But isn't your name Mrs. Cake?

10:49.449 --> 10:50.649
Not always.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.218
Back when I was Chiffon Swirl,

10:53.420 --> 10:56.488
I had no idea what I
was supposed to do.

10:56.690 --> 11:00.959
But one day, your mom brought me
some candied pears, eggs, flour,

11:01.061 --> 11:04.129
sugar and vanilla and told
me to just be creative.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.429
Next thing I knew,

11:05.531 --> 11:07.465
I was whipping up
pear upside-down cake

11:07.567 --> 11:09.301
and I got my cutie mark!

11:09.703 --> 11:11.936
It was like she knew what
I was supposed to do

11:12.038 --> 11:13.738
long before I did.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.607
Just like you, sugarcube!

11:15.809 --> 11:17.809
Or rather, you're
just like her!

11:17.911 --> 11:20.545
That was the first
of many cakes for me

11:20.647 --> 11:23.048
and Buttercup was with
me through it all.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.450
She'd be my taste tester...

11:27.753 --> 11:29.087
help with the
decorating...

11:32.758 --> 11:34.392
and prep new ingredients.

11:36.629 --> 11:39.330
Over the years, I
perfected my recipes.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.201
Your mom did so much for me,

11:43.503 --> 11:46.705
one day I wanted to
surprise her with a cake.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.198
Oh, it's just you!

12:14.000 --> 12:14.798
Sorry.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.669
I just brought you a little
something to say thank you...

12:18.171 --> 12:20.204
but I.. see you're busy. Heh.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.409
Promise you won't say anything?

12:31.650 --> 12:34.085
What in tarnation are
you doin', Bright Mac?

12:34.587 --> 12:37.388
We do not fraternize
with Pears!

12:37.790 --> 12:38.557
Ptui!

12:43.229 --> 12:45.096
You and Bright Mac?

12:45.398 --> 12:48.366
Oof. I wouldn't believe it if I
hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.702
Your families hate each other!

12:50.904 --> 12:54.106
I can't help it, we
just sort of happened.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.776
<i> Then Pear Butter told me</i>
<i> the sweetest love story</i>

12:57.878 --> 12:59.376
<i> I have ever heard.</i>

13:01.714 --> 13:04.482
Happy one-hundred-and-thirty-one
-thousand-four-hundred-

13:04.584 --> 13:06.751
and-fifty-six-hour
anniversary, Darlin.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.520
What? Ha ha.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.556
That's way longer than
we've been together.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.791
I know.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.826
But it's the anniversary
of the first time

13:14.928 --> 13:16.327
I called you Buttercup.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.431
It's OK if you didn't
get me anything.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.703
Actually, I did.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.838
A guitar? For me?

13:26.940 --> 13:29.474
But... I don't know
how to play!

13:29.876 --> 13:30.775

Hey! No fair!

15:09.509 --> 15:11.676
I was gonna tell
you the same thing!

15:11.978 --> 15:13.678
You're just mad
I beat you to it.

15:15.314 --> 15:16.613
I'm telling ya.

15:16.715 --> 15:19.017
I was gonna pull you
up, cover your eyes,

15:19.519 --> 15:20.685
lead you over here...

15:22.988 --> 15:24.188
and say "surprise!"

15:27.659 --> 15:31.129
And then you'd say,
"Oh, Bright Mac. I love it!"

15:31.331 --> 15:33.532
And then I'd say
"I love you."

15:34.234 --> 15:35.533
Too bad it didn't
work out, though.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.435
Yup. Too bad.

15:40.672 --> 15:42.440
The Pears are moving!

15:47.947 --> 15:49.680
I mean, I figured
the Pears moved

15:49.882 --> 15:52.216
but I didn't know all that
stuff happened before

15:52.318 --> 15:53.918
with Granny and Grand Pear.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.254
It must have been really
hard on our parents.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.522
Oh, it was...

15:59.157 --> 16:00.224
We're moving!?

16:00.326 --> 16:01.692
To Van Hoover!?

16:01.994 --> 16:03.194
But that's so far!

16:03.996 --> 16:05.763
It's what's best.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.199
There's acres of
untouched land

16:08.301 --> 16:10.134
and a warehouse to
make our jams!

16:10.236 --> 16:12.003
We'll get to expand
our business

16:12.405 --> 16:15.940
and get away from those
gosh darn Apples!

16:16.342 --> 16:18.476
<i> Mrs. Cake: Pear Butter</i>
<i> was devastated.</i>

16:18.778 --> 16:22.614
<i> But seeing no way out of it,</i>
<i> she did what she had to do.</i>

16:23.316 --> 16:24.549
So, that's it?

16:25.051 --> 16:26.517
What do you want me
to do, Bright Mac?

16:26.719 --> 16:27.617
We're moving.

16:27.919 --> 16:30.922
I love you but I have
to stay with my family.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.392
<i> Then Bright Mac did the</i>
<i> most romantic thing</i>

16:34.494 --> 16:36.294
<i> I've ever seen anypony do.</i>

16:37.462 --> 16:39.664
What? What? Tell us!

16:39.866 --> 16:42.934
We're gonna need one more
pony to tell that story.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.503
Mayor Mare, you
knew our parents?

16:46.105 --> 16:47.905
Not as well
as Mrs. Cake,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.208
but I did play a part
in their love story.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.443
The night before the
Pear family moved,

16:52.645 --> 16:54.445
Bright Mac asked
me to meet him

16:54.547 --> 16:56.947
at the edge of Sweet
Apple Acres...

17:03.456 --> 17:05.523
I don't want to be
apart from you, ever.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.993
I'm not sure what we'll
do but I'm sure of us.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.329
So sure that I'd
marry you today.

17:13.331 --> 17:14.398
I would too!

17:16.301 --> 17:18.303
I think that's my cue.

17:19.105 --> 17:23.107
<i> I had the honor of officiating</i>
<i> your parents' secret wedding.</i>

17:23.309 --> 17:25.343
<i> And it was perfect.</i>

17:25.845 --> 17:29.113
<i> Bright Mac knew Buttercup</i>
<i> wouldn't want a big splash--</i>

17:29.415 --> 17:31.516
<i> Apple Bloom: Reminds me of</i>
<i> somepony else I know...</i>

17:31.718 --> 17:33.016
<i> Big Mac: Hee hee. Eeeyup.</i>

17:33.618 --> 17:36.654
<i> Mayor Mare: So they had a</i>
<i>special way to seal their vows.</i>

17:38.557 --> 17:39.857
I now pronounce you--

17:39.959 --> 17:41.157
Granny: What is goin' on?

17:41.359 --> 17:43.060
What's with all
these here candles?

17:43.262 --> 17:45.129
Grand Pear: Pear
Butter, where are you?

17:45.431 --> 17:46.665
You're supposed
to be packing!

17:47.567 --> 17:49.700
What are you two doing?

17:52.637 --> 17:54.038
Ma, Grand Pear...

17:54.540 --> 17:55.873
Buttercup and I are in love.

17:56.475 --> 17:57.375
What!?

17:57.777 --> 18:00.444
And we'll be married as
soon as Mayor Mare says...

18:00.546 --> 18:02.280
Oh! I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

18:03.715 --> 18:04.915
Doesn't that feel nice.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.621
What are you talkin'
about? Married!?

18:10.823 --> 18:12.290
You two can't be married!

18:12.592 --> 18:14.124
Finally something
we can agree on!

18:14.226 --> 18:16.327
Pear Butter, enough
of this nonsense.

18:16.529 --> 18:20.265
We're moving and you gotta
stick with your family.

18:21.867 --> 18:24.803
But... the Apples are
my family now, too.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.175
You can't be serious.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.078
Are you.. choosing
to be an Apple?

18:34.280 --> 18:35.679
Over being a Pear?

18:37.082 --> 18:38.784
Are you making
me choose?

18:40.286 --> 18:41.719
Yes. I am.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.189
Then yeah.

18:45.491 --> 18:46.624
I guess I am.

18:50.528 --> 18:51.229
Fine!

18:57.903 --> 19:01.506
I can't believe Grand Pear
just up and left Ma like that.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.675
No wonder Granny never
told us about any of this.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.078
These things are never easy.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.547
And it's hard to know
when it is a good time.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.850
It seems to me that
now's as good a time as any.

19:13.052 --> 19:15.119
To talk to both
our grandparents.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.927
Apple Bloom: 'Scuse me?
Grand Pear?

19:23.629 --> 19:26.063
I'm Applejack and
this is Big MacIntosh

19:26.265 --> 19:28.332
but you already know
who we are, don't you?

19:29.034 --> 19:30.001
Sure do.

19:30.903 --> 19:34.204
Did you really move to Ponyville
just for a change of pace?

19:34.606 --> 19:35.406
No...

19:36.308 --> 19:38.342
Then you came here
because you're sorry

19:38.444 --> 19:40.045
and you want to get
to know us, too?

19:41.247 --> 19:43.314
I'm.. so sorry.

19:43.416 --> 19:48.286
I-I-I was just so angry,
but I never...

19:48.588 --> 19:50.221
It's in the past, Grand Pear.

19:52.757 --> 19:54.692
Ooh, can I call
you Grandpare Pear?

19:54.794 --> 19:56.427
[chuckle] Sure can!

19:59.131 --> 20:00.831
Now where'd you all get to?

20:01.133 --> 20:03.167
I ain't seen hide nor
hair of you's all day.

20:03.769 --> 20:04.969
We've been all over.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.138
Learning about our parents.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.107
Goh. Y-Ye have?

20:09.509 --> 20:11.809
And our grandfather.

20:15.413 --> 20:18.449
So you're back, hmmm?

20:18.951 --> 20:19.851
Sure am.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.354
[grumble] Never should've left...

20:23.656 --> 20:25.990
Finding you and learning all
about Mom and Dad...

20:26.492 --> 20:27.925
I feel like I found
a piece of me

20:28.027 --> 20:29.494
I didn't even
know was missing.

20:29.996 --> 20:33.198
Hearing their story makes me
feel closer to them, somehow.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.702
I'm sorry, I shoulda told
y'all about them sooner.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.404
And I should
have been here.

20:40.106 --> 20:45.676
Ahh.. I can't believe I let a silly
feud keep me from my family.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.578
Nothin's keeping
you from us now.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.614
Let's not miss
anything else.

20:50.316 --> 20:51.882
Applejack's right.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.619
Welcome back, prickly old pear.

20:56.021 --> 20:58.823
[chuckles] Thanks, you old crab apple.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.424
Now that we're
all together,

21:00.626 --> 21:02.059
there's something we
want to show you.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.462
Mom and Dad left us something
to remember them by.

21:04.664 --> 21:05.363
Come on!

21:11.436 --> 21:13.171
Whoa! Wow!

21:14.373 --> 21:16.174
It's beautiful!

21:16.576 --> 21:19.243
It's impossible...

21:20.680 --> 21:22.480
If anything's
gonna make it through,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.949
it's Apples <i>and</i>  Pears.
