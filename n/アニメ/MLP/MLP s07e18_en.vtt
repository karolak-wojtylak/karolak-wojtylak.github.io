WEBVTT

00:02.636 --> 00:03.769
Morning, Pinkie Pie.

00:03.971 --> 00:06.405
Get your Ponyville
Chronicle right here!

00:07.007 --> 00:08.605
Fan-tizzy-astic!

00:11.177 --> 00:13.979
I just love to read about happy
happenings and it's always good

00:14.081 --> 00:16.682
to be a pony in
the know, you know?

00:17.084 --> 00:19.285
And there's so much to know!

00:19.487 --> 00:22.488
Uh. Seems like a bunch of
boring hooey to me.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.824
Does "NEW SHRUBBERY
IN CASTLE GARDEN"!

00:25.926 --> 00:27.626
sound like boring
hooey to you?

00:28.128 --> 00:29.595
Snooze.

00:29.997 --> 00:30.696
What about...

00:31.498 --> 00:34.399
"PARASPRITE INFESTATION IN
FILLYDELPHIA ERADICATED"?

00:34.501 --> 00:36.302
Ah! That's great news!

00:36.804 --> 00:41.140
Ehhhh. Another day, another
parasprite hype story.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.809
Noodles named official
food of Whinnyapolis!

00:44.311 --> 00:46.412
Author A.K. Yearling
announces retirement!

00:46.714 --> 00:48.380
Cloudsdale election
heating up for candidate

00:48.482 --> 00:49.715
in favor of
cooling it down!

00:49.817 --> 00:51.583
WHAT? Let me see that!

00:51.685 --> 00:55.153
I never knew you were so
into politics, Rainbow.

00:55.255 --> 00:56.955
No, this!

00:57.057 --> 00:59.024
It CAN'T be true...

00:59.326 --> 01:01.326
I'd have never have picked
noodles as the official food

01:01.428 --> 01:02.427
of Whinnyapolis, either.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.263
But... here we are!

01:04.365 --> 01:05.764
No, Pinkie!

01:05.866 --> 01:06.932
I can't believe...

01:07.034 --> 01:08.400
that the greatest author...

01:08.502 --> 01:11.136
and secret pony
adventurer of all time...

01:11.338 --> 01:14.873
A.K. Yearling... is retiring!

01:54.180 --> 01:57.949
A.K. Yearling just
retired, like, today.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.685
Are you sure she wants visitors?

01:59.787 --> 02:02.654
Pinkie, the A.K. Yearling
I know would never quit

02:02.756 --> 02:04.323
and retire out of the blue!

02:04.425 --> 02:05.891
Something could
be really wrong

02:05.993 --> 02:07.826
and we need to make
sure she's OK.

02:07.928 --> 02:08.494
OK!

02:09.396 --> 02:12.663
Hey.... you're not just trying
to make sure she writes

02:12.765 --> 02:15.166
more Daring Do
books, are you?

02:15.268 --> 02:16.635
Of course not!

02:17.137 --> 02:18.570
But that wouldn't
hurt either.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.604
Now, come on!

02:24.010 --> 02:26.245
Uh.. maybe she's not home.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.647
Maybe she went to the
editor-in-chief of the

02:28.749 --> 02:31.349
Ponyville Chronicle to
correct the misprint they've made!

02:31.451 --> 02:32.584
Pinkie: Nope. She's home.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.618
How do you know?

02:33.820 --> 02:34.886
Because she's right there...

02:34.988 --> 02:36.355
looking all sad and alone.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.856
Ah! I knew it!

02:37.958 --> 02:39.558
Something is wrong!

02:39.660 --> 02:40.392
A.K!

02:40.694 --> 02:42.561
Now she's sighing with
the weight of the world.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.531
Now she's hanging her
head in utter despair!

02:45.933 --> 02:47.899
Now she's shaking her hoof
and cursing the heavens

02:48.001 --> 02:49.935
like nothing could ever
possibly be the same again!

02:50.037 --> 02:52.270
Why oh why did this
happen to her!?

02:52.372 --> 02:52.871
What!?

02:53.573 --> 02:54.072
Whoops.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.842
Never mind, that time
she was just stretching. Heh.

02:57.244 --> 03:01.212
A.K., it's us! Rainbow
Dash and Pinkie Pie!

03:01.414 --> 03:02.647
Your friends!

03:09.823 --> 03:12.290
Oh, no. Did somepony ransack
your cottage again

03:12.492 --> 03:14.092
and steal some ancient
mysterious relic

03:14.194 --> 03:16.027
that's the key to saving
all of Equestria!?

03:16.229 --> 03:18.296
Oooh! Sparky!

03:22.069 --> 03:24.003
Nothing's been stolen..

03:24.305 --> 03:27.672
Then is somepony blackmailing
you and forcing you to retire?

03:27.874 --> 03:29.307
Cause if they are...

03:29.909 --> 03:31.911
No. Nothing like that.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.413
So.. you're just quitting
and moving away!?

03:35.515 --> 03:38.650
WHY. WOULD. YOU. DO. THAT?

03:38.852 --> 03:42.287
I already explained everything
to the Ponyville Chronicle.

03:42.589 --> 03:43.789
Oh, really?

03:44.391 --> 03:46.892
"Author A.K. Yearling
announced yesterday

03:46.994 --> 03:49.828
that the next adventure novel
in her popular series,

03:49.930 --> 03:52.263
'Daring Do and the Curse
of the Pharaoh's Tomb'

03:52.365 --> 03:53.899
will be her last.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.435
Yearling looks forward
to her retirement."

03:56.937 --> 03:58.937
That doesn't
explain anything!

04:00.107 --> 04:02.808
It just says you're
giving up writing stories.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.244
But most ponies don't know that
you actually are Daring Do

04:06.346 --> 04:07.846
and that the
stories are real.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.115
So what you're REALLY saying
is that you're giving up

04:10.217 --> 04:12.918
being Daring Do, but
you're not saying why!

04:13.020 --> 04:14.886
Of course, if you don't
feel like talking about it,

04:14.988 --> 04:17.255
that's A-OK, A.K.!

04:17.357 --> 04:20.025
As your friends, we
completely understand.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.427
Right, Rainbow Dash?

04:22.629 --> 04:26.131
Oh. Yeah. We just came to
make sure you're all right.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.101
That's.. really why we wanted
to find out what's going on.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.537
If you really
want to know...

04:31.939 --> 04:35.474
My last quest took me to a
village in Southern Equestria

04:35.676 --> 04:38.142
where I started seeing.. these.

04:39.011 --> 04:41.046
"WAKE OF DESTRUCTION:

04:41.348 --> 04:44.316
DARING DO RUINS ENTIRE
VILLAGE MARKETPLACE"!

04:45.018 --> 04:46.518
"DARE OR SCARE?

04:46.620 --> 04:50.422
LOCAL ROGUE 'DARING DO'
INVOLVED IN FRIGHTFUL FIASCO"?

04:50.524 --> 04:53.892
"DARING DO LEADS BULL INTO CHINA
SHOP DURING HIGH SPEED CHASE--"

04:53.994 --> 04:54.826
That's enough!

04:55.897 --> 04:58.630
Everypony I tried to
help is mad at me.

04:58.832 --> 04:59.564
That's not true!

04:59.666 --> 05:01.166
They're not mad
at A.K. Yearling.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.168
They're mad at
"Daring Do".

05:03.570 --> 05:06.071
They don't sell my books
in Southern Equestria.

05:06.273 --> 05:09.274
The ponies there don't
know who A.K. Yearling is.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.810
They only know Daring Do

05:11.912 --> 05:15.113
and apparently she does
more harm than good.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.415
And I guess it's a good thing
you look so different

05:17.617 --> 05:18.850
as A.K. Yearling!

05:19.152 --> 05:21.119
So all we have to
do is go down there

05:21.221 --> 05:24.055
and explain to these ponies that
none of this stuff is true.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.924
Easy-peazy-cheezy!

05:26.526 --> 05:28.160
But that's just the thing...

05:28.862 --> 05:30.261
...it<i> is</i> true.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.363
WHAT?

05:31.665 --> 05:33.398
I guess I've always
been so focused

05:33.600 --> 05:36.034
on saving priceless relics
and stopping the bad guys

05:36.136 --> 05:39.538
that.. I never really thought
about the mess I leave behind.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.007
Then you ARE in
a tricky pickle.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.910
But.. why is all this
happening now?

05:45.212 --> 05:48.046
Ah.. I guess ponies are
finally fed up.

05:48.148 --> 05:52.684
Either way, I'm done with
adventures: having or writing.

05:52.886 --> 05:53.919
Come on!

05:54.021 --> 05:55.587
For every one
pony who's upset,

05:55.689 --> 05:58.557
there must be at least a hundred
that know you're a hero.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.426
I don't think so, Dash.

06:01.628 --> 06:06.164
Well, why don't we go visit
this village "Somnambula"

06:06.266 --> 06:07.799
and see for ourselves?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.934
Those articles seem to
make it pretty clear

06:10.036 --> 06:11.303
how the villagers feel.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.639
But if we go there, the ponies
can tell you in person

06:14.741 --> 06:16.875
just how much they
appreciate you.

06:16.977 --> 06:20.611
And what a heap of rotten apple
cores these articles are!

06:21.881 --> 06:23.382
You really think so?

06:23.784 --> 06:24.983
I know so!

06:25.285 --> 06:26.417
Let's go!

06:41.235 --> 06:43.935
Mmmmmm! This is so cool!

06:44.037 --> 06:46.471
It looks just like that
village in your last book

06:46.673 --> 06:48.673
where Daring Do recovers
the Doomed Diadem

06:48.775 --> 06:50.075
from The Wild Bunch Gang

06:50.177 --> 06:51.876
who chase after her
through the desert!

06:52.078 --> 06:52.878
It should.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.647
I based that entire chapter
on my experiences here

06:55.749 --> 06:57.048
in Somnambula.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.818
What happens? No
wait, don't tell me.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.620
I CHANGED MY MIND! TELL ME!

07:01.722 --> 07:04.756
Daring Do thwarts Ahuizotl's
evil plot to separate

07:04.858 --> 07:06.324
the Sister Crown Relics.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.027
And if it wasn't for her, the
region would be cursed

07:09.129 --> 07:12.597
with eternal night and the
entire town of Somnambula

07:12.699 --> 07:14.433
would have sunk
into the ground!

07:14.935 --> 07:17.268
Ah Pssht! There's no
chance that these ponies

07:17.370 --> 07:18.837
don't think you're a hero.

07:20.239 --> 07:21.506
Watch this.

07:23.342 --> 07:25.110
Hiya there, Mister!

07:25.312 --> 07:30.081
I was hoping you could tell me
about a pony named Daring Do.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.051
I hear she's an awesome
adventure-pony hero.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.519
Daring Do?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.756
Oh, she's awesome, all right.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.391
Awesome at destroying
ponies' apple carts

07:41.428 --> 07:43.895
and priceless,
sacred statues!

07:46.266 --> 07:48.733
Indeed. Daring
Do is a menace

07:48.835 --> 07:51.336
who destroys everything
she touches!

07:54.474 --> 07:55.507
What? No!

07:55.609 --> 07:58.210
Daring Do is the exact
opposite of a menace.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.179
Ugh. I tried to tell you!

08:01.481 --> 08:03.348
Coming back here
was a mistake!

08:09.789 --> 08:12.991
Come on, A.K.! So we
picked a bad example.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.026
That was just one angry pony!

08:15.228 --> 08:16.695
Two angry ponies!

08:16.897 --> 08:17.996
It doesn't matter.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.865
I never should
have come with you!

08:20.167 --> 08:21.800
You two should just go home.

08:24.303 --> 08:25.904
Come on! We gotta
follow her!

08:26.106 --> 08:27.139
I dunno...

08:27.241 --> 08:29.574
it really seemed like
she doesn't want us

08:29.676 --> 08:31.243
cramping her saddle.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.813
But we have to convince her
that ponies do appreciate her!

08:35.015 --> 08:38.216
As her friend, I have to
make sure she believes that.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.489
Ooh. Look, Pinkie! It's
the "Get On Inn".

08:44.691 --> 08:47.293
Daring Do stays here all
the time in her adventures.

08:47.995 --> 08:51.997
Which means there must be
ponies here who love Daring Do!

08:52.099 --> 08:53.365
Maybe they can help us.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.033
Mmmmm.

08:55.135 --> 08:59.037
My nose is telling me to
help myself to muffins.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.340
Come on...

09:04.010 --> 09:06.177
Ooo, she's fancy.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.379
I got this!

09:07.481 --> 09:09.981
A good evening
to you, Madame!

09:10.083 --> 09:13.218
We are but weary travelers who
humbly wish to inquire

09:13.320 --> 09:15.720
on the status of a
certain mare of intrigue

09:15.822 --> 09:17.522
taking residence here.

09:17.624 --> 09:20.725
What in Southern Equestria
are you on about?

09:20.827 --> 09:22.894
Is it true that
Daring Do stays here?

09:22.996 --> 09:25.330
Ha! Not anymore, she doesn't!

09:26.232 --> 09:27.299
Why not?

09:27.601 --> 09:30.168
The last time I rented
that rascal a room,

09:30.270 --> 09:32.637
she was in a such a rush to
high-tail it outta here,

09:32.739 --> 09:34.205
she didn't even pay her bill!

09:34.307 --> 09:37.342
But--
After that, a band of
ruffians showed up

09:37.444 --> 09:39.378
and destroyed half the
rooms looking for her.

09:39.480 --> 09:42.547
Guess she made them even
more mad than she made me!

09:42.849 --> 09:44.716
No, no, no. You've
got it all wrong.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.785
Huh! How do ya figure?

09:46.887 --> 09:49.554
Daring Do was trying to
save everypony from the

09:49.656 --> 09:52.324
Curse of the Doomed
Diadem of Xilati!

09:52.526 --> 09:55.327
And she was only in a rush
because she had to get the crown

09:55.429 --> 09:59.431
back to the Tiara of Teotlale
before the curse took effect.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.266
Chapter seventeen.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.102
Sounds like a tall tale to me.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.871
And a hard one to believe now
that I know Daring Do

10:06.973 --> 10:10.042
is a scoundrel and a thief!

10:10.744 --> 10:14.346
Every year, ponies come to
offer precious glowpaz

10:14.448 --> 10:16.881
to the Sonmambula
statue in the village

10:16.983 --> 10:18.950
in hopes for a good future.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.853
Why that poor fella had
his glowpaz necklace

10:21.955 --> 10:25.290
stolen by Daring Do
just yesterday!

10:25.692 --> 10:26.491
Hmmmm.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.128
THERE'S A.K.!

10:31.964 --> 10:36.535
Daring Do RUINED our town and
stole our precious glowpaz!

10:36.737 --> 10:39.704
We need to make sure that
if she turns up again,

10:39.806 --> 10:41.973
there will be consequences!

10:42.075 --> 10:46.377
Everypony who's with me,
meet at the statue tomorrow!

10:47.815 --> 10:50.882
[sigh] Now I'm getting blamed for
things I didn't even do?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.584
Why would I steal from them?

10:52.786 --> 10:55.220
They are SUPER BAD!

10:55.322 --> 10:57.155
But... we're still
staying the night, right?

10:58.157 --> 11:01.392
Because I already ate all
the free mini muffins!

11:02.294 --> 11:04.729
Listen, A.K., after a
good night's sleep,

11:04.831 --> 11:06.464
we're going to fix
all of this.

11:06.566 --> 11:07.632
I promise.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.605
I shouldn't be
here, Rainbow Dash.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.073
This is never
going to work.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.608
Of course it will!

11:17.310 --> 11:20.545
All I have to do is go up
there and explain to everypony

11:20.647 --> 11:22.447
how wrong they all are.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.684
Yeah! And then I'll be
like what she said!

11:25.786 --> 11:28.620
[sigh] Easy-peazy-cheezy.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.021
Exactly!

11:30.123 --> 11:32.590
Here it is! The
remains of your--

11:32.692 --> 11:35.327
I mean our
Somnambula statue.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.196
Now that Daring Do has
destroyed it, tell me...

11:38.498 --> 11:40.966
where will we hang our glowpaz?

11:41.168 --> 11:43.902
We don't even have any glowpaz
because they were stolen

11:44.004 --> 11:45.270
by Daring Do!

11:50.076 --> 11:52.477
Daring Do would
never steal anything!

11:52.579 --> 11:55.146
And OK, she destroyed
your statue,

11:55.248 --> 11:57.282
but it was because she was
trying to save you all

11:57.384 --> 11:58.650
from Ahuizotl!

12:01.755 --> 12:02.554
Ahuizotl?

12:02.656 --> 12:03.622
He's about yay big?

12:03.724 --> 12:04.555
Long neck?

12:04.657 --> 12:05.290
Itty-bitty face?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.924
Weird claw thingy on his tail?

12:08.227 --> 12:11.730
Ooo! Ooo! I know him!
He's a baddie.

12:16.637 --> 12:19.638
Trust me, if Ahuizotl had gotten
away with the Doomed Diadem,

12:19.740 --> 12:22.073
your entire village would
have been swallowed up!

12:22.175 --> 12:25.710
And that's a lot worse than
losing some CRUMMY old statue!

12:26.847 --> 12:27.913
Ahem!

12:28.115 --> 12:30.949
This was not some
crummy old statue.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.118
It was the namesake
of our town.

12:33.220 --> 12:37.455
If you want to understand us,
you must first understand her.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.123
Who?

12:38.225 --> 12:39.558
Somnambula...

12:39.760 --> 12:44.429
<i> Long ago this village fell</i>
<i> prey to an evil Sphinx</i>

12:44.531 --> 12:46.832
<i> who demanded most</i>
<i> of their crops.</i>

12:47.434 --> 12:51.503
<i> Like her fellow villagers,</i>
<i> Somnambula didn't have much,</i>

12:52.205 --> 12:55.707
<i> but she used what she had to</i>
<i>keep others from giving up hope.</i>

12:57.009 --> 12:59.577
<i> The son of the</i>
<i> Pharaoh, Prince Hisan,</i>

12:59.679 --> 13:01.780
<i> was so moved by</i>
<i> her compassion,</i>

13:01.882 --> 13:05.850
<i> that he decreed nopony</i>
<i> would go hungry again.</i>

13:11.559 --> 13:14.326
<i> But when Hisan stood</i>
<i> up to the Sphinx,</i>

13:15.428 --> 13:19.230
<i>the beast captured him, telling</i>
<i> the Pharaoh the only way</i>

13:19.332 --> 13:22.934
<i> to get Hisan back was to</i>
<i> solve her riddle.</i>

13:23.336 --> 13:26.504
<i> Nopony would volunteer</i>
<i> to save the prince.</i>

13:26.806 --> 13:29.841
<i> Nopony except Somnambula.</i>

13:36.316 --> 13:38.717
<i>The Sphinx gave her the riddle,</i>

13:38.919 --> 13:44.789
<i>"I shine brightest in the dark.</i>
<i> I am there but cannot be seen.</i>

13:44.991 --> 13:47.025
<i> To have me costs you nothing.</i>

13:47.227 --> 13:50.929
<i> To be without me costs</i>
<i> you everything."</i>

13:51.231 --> 13:53.398
<i> As Somnambula thought</i>
<i> of the hardship</i>

13:53.500 --> 13:56.368
<i> she and her fellow</i>
<i> villagers had experienced,</i>

13:56.670 --> 13:58.803
<i> she instantly</i>
<i> knew the answer.</i>

13:59.205 --> 13:59.838
<i> "HOPE!"</i>

13:59.940 --> 14:01.072
<i> She shouted.</i>

14:02.176 --> 14:05.844
<i> The Sphinx was so enraged, it</i>
<i> seemed she might still refuse</i>

14:05.946 --> 14:07.178
<i> to release the prince,</i>

14:07.380 --> 14:11.182
<i> so Somnambula asked her</i>
<i> for one more challenge,</i>

14:11.284 --> 14:12.951
<i> but if she</i>
<i> accomplished it,</i>

14:13.053 --> 14:16.421
<i> the Sphinx would leave</i>
<i> from the kingdom forever.</i>

14:16.823 --> 14:18.223
<i> The Sphinx quickly agreed,</i>

14:18.325 --> 14:21.526
<i> asking only that Somnambula</i>
<i> walk to the prince...</i>

14:21.628 --> 14:25.964
<i> ... across a deep</i>
<i> chasm, blindfolded!</i>

14:26.166 --> 14:29.467
<i> Further, the Sphinx had</i>
<i> cast a powerful spell</i>

14:29.569 --> 14:31.970
<i> that prevented</i>
<i> Somnambula from flying.</i>

14:35.074 --> 14:38.076
<i>But Somnambula never lost HOPE!</i>

14:38.178 --> 14:40.245
<i> She knew she'd need to</i>
<i> make a leap of faith</i>

14:40.347 --> 14:41.981
<i> to save the prince.</i>

14:43.083 --> 14:45.616
<i> Guided by the sound</i>
<i> of the prince's voice...</i>

14:48.420 --> 14:51.289
<i> she easily made it across.</i>

14:58.764 --> 15:01.500
<i> The Pharaoh asked how</i>
<i> Somnambula prevailed</i>

15:01.802 --> 15:04.469
<i> and she explained that</i>
<i> she had always hoped</i>

15:04.571 --> 15:06.972
<i> she could make things</i>
<i> better for her people</i>

15:07.274 --> 15:10.175
<i> and that hope</i>
<i> had carried her through.</i>

15:10.477 --> 15:13.678
<i> The Prince replaced the</i>
<i> pearls Somnambula gave up</i>

15:13.780 --> 15:16.014
<i> with a string of Glowpaz.</i>

15:16.216 --> 15:19.517
<i> And around her neck, they</i>
<i> glowed bright enough</i>

15:19.619 --> 15:22.487
<i> to light the entire kingdom.</i>

15:22.889 --> 15:27.892
<i> Forever after, Glowpaz</i>
<i> became our symbol of hope.</i>

15:29.695 --> 15:34.099
Wow. I had no idea how special
the statue was to you.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.868
Somnambula sounds like
a pretty cool pony.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.603
But I bet if she were here,

15:38.705 --> 15:41.139
she'd tell you how cool
Daring Do is too

15:41.241 --> 15:43.441
because they've both
fought to protect this town!

15:45.746 --> 15:49.214
If Somnambula were here today,
she would condemn Daring Do

15:49.316 --> 15:52.584
for destroying yo--
OUR symbol of hope!

16:07.200 --> 16:08.198
Hey, buddy!

16:08.300 --> 16:11.602
What did Daring Do ever do
to you to deserve all this?

16:11.804 --> 16:14.405
Only... everything!

16:14.607 --> 16:16.541
Dr. Caballeron!?

16:16.743 --> 16:19.977
Yes... Rainbow Dash.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.883
When I saw you,
her closest friend,

16:24.985 --> 16:27.752
I knew that Daring Do
would not be far behind.

16:27.954 --> 16:31.556
I really do owe you for
leading her right to me.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.924
But I didn't mean--

16:33.026 --> 16:35.426
Thank you for helping me
break Daring Do's spirit

16:35.528 --> 16:37.428
by destroying
her reputation,

16:37.630 --> 16:40.932
but I can't have you running
off and telling her my plan.

16:47.106 --> 16:48.639
HELP!

16:50.075 --> 16:51.209
Caballeron?

16:51.411 --> 16:52.376
No!

16:52.478 --> 16:53.711
He's got Rainbow Dash!

16:53.913 --> 16:54.779
Come on!

17:00.987 --> 17:05.589
I'm... coming...
Rainbow... Dash...

17:06.759 --> 17:08.426
Oh! I knew you'd come!

17:08.728 --> 17:09.727
You did?

17:09.829 --> 17:10.862
I sure didn't.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.763
What if I cause
more trouble?

17:12.965 --> 17:13.831
You won't.

17:13.933 --> 17:14.899
How do you know?

17:15.001 --> 17:16.034
I just do!

17:16.236 --> 17:18.202
You wouldn't let anything
happen to Rainbow Dash.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.971
You care too much.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.305
You're right.

17:21.407 --> 17:22.640
Which way did they go?

17:26.378 --> 17:27.445
To the pyramid!

17:28.680 --> 17:30.714
Dash: Somepony help!

17:31.983 --> 17:34.319
Dash: Somepony! Anypony!

17:35.021 --> 17:36.654
Pinkie Pie! Daring Do!

17:36.756 --> 17:37.922
Is that you?

17:38.024 --> 17:39.190
Don't worry, Rainbow!

17:39.392 --> 17:40.891
We'll save you!

17:47.500 --> 17:50.702
If my previous plan didn't cause
you to give up, Daring Do,

17:50.904 --> 17:54.405
then the shame of losing your
dear friend Rainbow Dash

17:54.507 --> 17:56.140
to the slime will!

17:57.809 --> 18:02.480
Oh, and that ancient magic
from the legend is real.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.049
There'll be no flying
in the pyramid!

18:05.451 --> 18:07.485
Good luck, Daring Do!

18:14.693 --> 18:17.695
He's right! We'll never
get to her in time!

18:17.997 --> 18:20.231
If this really is like
Somnambula's story,

18:20.333 --> 18:22.700
then we just have to
have hope that we can!

18:22.902 --> 18:24.903
I think we need more
than hope, Pinkie.

18:25.005 --> 18:27.672
There was a bridge in the story
and there's no bridge here.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.273
What are we going to do?

18:31.277 --> 18:33.911
I don't know, but Rainbow
Dash is our friend!

18:34.113 --> 18:37.014
Just like Somnambula. We
need to make a leap of faith

18:37.116 --> 18:38.949
and hope that we can save her!

18:39.985 --> 18:41.218
PINKIE!

18:45.590 --> 18:46.157
A-ha!

18:47.458 --> 18:48.725
Wheeee! Hee hee hee!

18:51.264 --> 18:53.031
I knew we'd do it!

18:53.133 --> 18:55.700
Thanks for reminding me to
never give up hope, Pinkie.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.103
And I'm kinda hoping you
ponies will untie me

18:59.205 --> 19:02.106
before we all take a bath
in bubbling green slime!

19:04.309 --> 19:05.276
We're on it!

19:22.060 --> 19:23.994
Not so fast, Caballeron!

19:28.367 --> 19:30.534
YOU stole our glowpaz!

19:34.140 --> 19:37.041
I should have known you were
just trying to sully my name

19:37.143 --> 19:39.844
so that you'd be free to
steal whatever you wanted.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.747
Of course that was
the plan, Daring Do!

19:42.849 --> 19:45.483
At first I just
wanted the Glowpaz...

19:45.585 --> 19:50.688
But then I saw an opportunity to
write you out of the story

19:50.790 --> 19:51.690
FOR GOOD!

19:54.661 --> 19:58.262
And with the destruction
you leave in your wake,

19:58.364 --> 20:00.464
it didn't take too much
to convince ponies

20:00.766 --> 20:02.567
you were a villain!

20:02.969 --> 20:05.069
You're wrong, Caballeron.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.438
And I won't let you
break my spirit again.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.807
Because I'm never
going to give up hope

20:09.909 --> 20:12.576
that I can protect ponies
and ancient treasures

20:12.678 --> 20:14.712
from miscreants like you!

20:17.116 --> 20:19.684
Remember! She
ruined your statue!

20:20.286 --> 20:22.352
You're fools to
believe in her!

20:25.357 --> 20:29.860
Grrrr! You'll pay for this, Daring Do!

20:34.300 --> 20:36.166
OK, OK that's enough!

20:37.936 --> 20:40.271
Thanks for helping
me come to my senses.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.972
You two are true friends.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.307
Are you kidding?

20:43.609 --> 20:44.208
That.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.075
Was.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.377
Awesome!

20:46.479 --> 20:49.346
We're just glad you're back
to your old self again!

20:49.448 --> 20:51.149
[giggle] Me too!

20:51.551 --> 20:53.684
But I'm glad I realized that
even if you're fighting

20:53.786 --> 20:57.455
for something good, you're still
responsible for your actions.

20:57.757 --> 21:01.025
And if something bad happens
that you didn't intend,

21:01.227 --> 21:04.328
you shouldn't give up hope
or lose faith in yourself.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.632
Yeah! All ya gotta do
is make it right.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.001
Feel free to use that
in your next book!

21:10.303 --> 21:12.170
You know, I think I will.
