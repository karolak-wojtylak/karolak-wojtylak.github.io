WEBVTT

00:01.648 --> 00:04.035
Today is the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders!

00:04.036 --> 00:05.819
I can just feel it!

00:05.820 --> 00:10.126
Today is the day we are all gonna
get our cutie marks in...

00:10.127 --> 00:12.050
...bowlin'!

00:12.473 --> 00:14.017
Woohoo!

00:16.527 --> 00:18.776
I mean... Yaaay!

00:18.777 --> 00:23.095
Why, after today we won't even be
the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore.

00:23.096 --> 00:24.103
We'll be the...

00:24.104 --> 00:25.850
...the Three Strikes!

00:25.851 --> 00:28.529
That makes us sound
like we've struck out.

00:30.051 --> 00:32.824
How about... the Pin Twins!

00:33.024 --> 00:35.590
But there are three of us.

00:36.763 --> 00:39.227
Okay then. Um...

00:39.228 --> 00:41.336
The Bowling Dolls!

00:42.829 --> 00:45.215
The Bowling Dolls! That's it!

00:45.216 --> 00:46.240
Perfect!

00:46.241 --> 00:49.686
Alrighty then. Let's bowl 'em over!

01:32.515 --> 01:35.046
Cool! A bowling cutie mark!

01:35.565 --> 01:37.614
I did it! I did it!

01:39.125 --> 01:40.499
Blank?

01:44.763 --> 01:46.473
But... But...

01:47.003 --> 01:48.809
But what about my ball?

02:37.662 --> 02:39.413
That bowling sure was fun.

02:39.414 --> 02:41.516
Even if all I got was gutterballs.

02:41.517 --> 02:44.992
Yeah. At least you're able to
keep your ball in your lane.

02:44.993 --> 02:48.412
I don't think Mr. Kingpin is ever
gonna let me play again.

02:50.822 --> 02:54.107
Hey! Maybe I could get
my cutie mark in demolition?

03:00.231 --> 03:01.873
Aw, come on, Apple Bloom.

03:01.874 --> 03:05.187
I know just what you need to
put the bloom back on your apple.

03:07.370 --> 03:10.305
A treat from Sugarcube Corner
will cheer you up!

03:11.838 --> 03:13.493
No, it won't.

03:14.705 --> 03:16.567
A party will cheer you up!

03:19.138 --> 03:20.592
No, it won't.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.930
A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.

03:26.703 --> 03:28.351
No, it won't!

03:29.284 --> 03:32.382
Come on, Apple Bloom!
It's just a cutie mark.

03:32.383 --> 03:34.485
Or lack of a cutie mark!

03:34.486 --> 03:36.221
Shh! That's not helping.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.606
Apple Bloom! Where are you going?

03:40.437 --> 03:42.617
Apple Bloom! Come back!

03:49.573 --> 03:51.008
Whoa!

03:56.583 --> 03:59.131
Well. Who is it that we have here?

04:00.037 --> 04:02.838
Why, it's Apple Bloom, my dear.

04:02.839 --> 04:04.463
Aw!

04:05.245 --> 04:07.597
What has happened to you, youth?

04:08.935 --> 04:11.911
Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth.

04:12.154 --> 04:14.846
Come with me. I have just the trick...

04:14.847 --> 04:17.044
...that will fix you up quite quick.

04:19.308 --> 04:23.256
I tried everything, Thecora.
And thtill no cutie mark.

04:23.257 --> 04:27.664
Why, I'm gonna be as old as Granny
Thmith and thtill have a blank flank.

04:27.665 --> 04:30.461
Your frustration is well understood.

04:30.462 --> 04:33.620
But one must be patient
for all things good.

04:34.583 --> 04:37.467
I've heard that from everypony I know.

04:37.468 --> 04:40.627
And now from every Thebra I know.

04:40.628 --> 04:43.469
I'm jutht too impathient
to be pathient.

04:43.878 --> 04:47.218
I jutht want my cutie mark
and I want it now!

04:52.913 --> 04:55.901
For your cutie mark
you will have to wait.

04:56.035 --> 04:58.541
We must fix that tooth
before it's too late!

05:02.041 --> 05:04.747
Now drink down every little drop...

05:04.748 --> 05:07.466
...and this mixture will
mend that chip on top.

05:20.159 --> 05:23.415
Oh my star apples! You did it, Zecora!

05:24.278 --> 05:25.617
Golly.

05:25.618 --> 05:28.464
You have tonics that heal
all sorts of ailments.

05:28.664 --> 05:31.615
Bad bones, bad back, bad breath...

05:31.616 --> 05:33.798
Yes, little one. It is true.

05:33.799 --> 05:35.588
I have many a healing brew.

05:35.589 --> 05:38.118
And not only stuff that fixes the bad...

05:38.119 --> 05:40.264
...but stuff that brings the good.

05:40.265 --> 05:43.722
Good health, good hair... good heavens!

05:44.926 --> 05:46.404
Hmm...

05:46.405 --> 05:51.051
I bet you can mix up
a brew to fix... anything.

05:53.239 --> 05:55.606
There are many mixtures in this room...

05:55.607 --> 05:58.407
...but none for what you
want, dear Apple Bloom.

05:58.748 --> 06:01.516
A magic potion does not hold the key...

06:02.008 --> 06:06.123
...for a cutie mark.
Time is the only remedy.

06:06.293 --> 06:07.445
Fine.

06:14.268 --> 06:15.860
What's you got goin' on there?

06:15.861 --> 06:19.917
I am brewing up another mix
for a rooster and his chicks.

06:20.168 --> 06:22.235
It seems the rooster
has lost his crow...

06:22.236 --> 06:24.719
...making mornings very slow.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.578
Hey! I've seen that flower
bloomin' in Ponyville. What is it?

06:28.579 --> 06:31.335
It is one we call "heart's desire".

06:31.336 --> 06:34.531
A dash will ignite the rooster's fire.

06:36.824 --> 06:39.991
With heart's desire his
talent comes into view...

06:39.992 --> 06:43.020
...and he'll make a mighty
cock-a-doodle-doo!

06:44.679 --> 06:46.628
Zowie!

06:47.530 --> 06:49.705
Heart's desire, huh?

06:49.706 --> 06:52.214
Ay me! But what is this?

06:52.215 --> 06:54.094
I've run out of amethyst.

06:54.095 --> 06:58.020
I must go get this purple flower
for my brew to have full power.

06:58.826 --> 07:01.335
Yeah. You go. You go.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.419
I'm so hungry.

07:08.420 --> 07:10.181
Yeah. I can't wait...

07:15.654 --> 07:19.383
Apple Bloom! You've got
your cutie mark!

07:27.268 --> 07:30.793
Um... Apple Bloom. What is it?

07:30.794 --> 07:35.006
Yeah. Is it an "O"?
Is your talent spelling?

07:35.007 --> 07:37.988
Or is it a ring? Are you
a jewelery maker?

07:37.989 --> 07:41.982
Or ith it a powdered donut?
Cauthe that thouhdth delithoiuth.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.909
No. It's a loop-de-hoop!

07:48.623 --> 07:49.634
A what now?

07:49.635 --> 07:53.043
A loop-de-hoop. 'least that's
what I always called it.

07:53.044 --> 07:56.518
Applejack made it for my from
an old ring barrel when I was littler.

07:56.519 --> 08:00.594
Who'd have thought that loop-de-hoop
would end up bein' my special talent?

08:00.595 --> 08:03.591
Wow, Apple Bloom! That's amazing!

08:03.592 --> 08:06.184
That's it? That's your talent?

08:06.185 --> 08:09.863
Spinning a hoop around
your waist? Puh-lease.

08:09.864 --> 08:13.259
Oh. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

08:30.616 --> 08:34.232
Apple Bloom! You're super-duper
loop-de-hooper!

08:34.773 --> 08:36.782
Thanks, everypony.

08:38.102 --> 08:41.200
All right, my little ponies!
Time for class!

08:45.510 --> 08:46.595
Apple Bloom.

08:47.129 --> 08:48.502
Yes, miss Cheerilee?

08:48.503 --> 08:52.640
I want you to take your
loop-de-hoop into the yard...

08:53.390 --> 08:57.363
...and give us all a lesson in
your amazing loop-de-hooping!

09:11.117 --> 09:12.289
Oh! Oh!

09:16.396 --> 09:20.867
Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you
might get to be half as good as me.

09:25.104 --> 09:26.655
Great job, girls!

09:26.656 --> 09:28.555
You're too kind, Apple Bloom.

09:28.556 --> 09:30.246
Yeah, we stink.

09:30.247 --> 09:33.326
Nah. You just need a little practice.

09:33.327 --> 09:34.945
Soon you'll be able to...

09:34.946 --> 09:36.598
Hoop'n'bob!

09:39.074 --> 09:40.358
Hoop'n'hop!

09:42.074 --> 09:43.581
Hoop'n'skip!

09:44.511 --> 09:46.753
And hoop'n'flip!

09:55.205 --> 09:56.852
Show us some more, Apple Bloom.

09:56.853 --> 10:01.203
Well, alright. Just a few
more tricks. But be warned...

10:01.204 --> 10:04.753
...these are advanced moves.
Not for beginners.

10:05.398 --> 10:07.564
Got that, Diamond Tiara?

10:09.280 --> 10:13.205
I call this one the hoopla!

10:32.041 --> 10:34.957
Another cutie mark? Ha!

10:34.958 --> 10:37.700
I guess that last trick
was a lot of hoopla.

10:37.701 --> 10:39.899
Those cutie marks are fake!

10:41.548 --> 10:43.593
What? No, they're not!

10:43.834 --> 10:48.729
Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard
of a pony with two cutie marks?

10:48.730 --> 10:51.395
I must say that I never have.

10:51.677 --> 10:54.900
But maybe Apple Bloom
has two special talents?

10:55.350 --> 10:59.223
Oh yeah? Then let's see you do that.

10:59.620 --> 11:01.744
-Spin plates!
-Yeah!

11:06.648 --> 11:08.777
Two cutie marks?

11:08.778 --> 11:10.901
Two talents?

11:12.783 --> 11:14.605
Aw yeah!

11:15.242 --> 11:18.748
Our friend is the most
special pony ever!

11:19.175 --> 11:23.576
Alright, everypony!
You ready for a real show?

12:28.309 --> 12:30.336
Yeehaw, little sis!

12:30.337 --> 12:34.793
Huh, congratulations on gettin'
not just one but two cutie marks.

12:34.794 --> 12:37.754
Oh, we're mighty proud of you.
Right, Big McIntosh?

12:37.755 --> 12:39.006
Eeyup.

12:39.747 --> 12:42.570
I've never seen anythin' like it.
Have you, Big Mac?

12:42.981 --> 12:43.885
Nnope!

12:44.158 --> 12:48.754
Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and
a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin'...

12:48.755 --> 12:51.951
...reminded me of when
I was a spry young filly.

12:53.386 --> 12:54.996
Charlie horse! Charlie horse!

12:57.283 --> 12:58.695
That's better.

12:59.608 --> 13:03.558
Why, Apple Bloom. I think you're ready
to hit the rodeo circuit right now.

13:03.559 --> 13:06.633
Actually, I'm ready to
hit the hay right now.

13:06.634 --> 13:10.686
I'm plum tucker.
I'll see y'all in the mornin'.

13:10.687 --> 13:11.763
'night!

13:12.005 --> 13:13.044
'night!

13:13.513 --> 13:17.326
Oh my! Little Apple Bloom
has finally blossomed!

13:17.327 --> 13:20.066
-Hasn't she, Big Mac?
-Eeyep!

13:27.606 --> 13:29.672
What in tarnation is that?

13:34.338 --> 13:37.131
Apple Bloom. What is all that awful...

13:38.658 --> 13:39.892
...tapping?

13:41.082 --> 13:43.085
Three cutie marks?!

13:43.086 --> 13:45.182
Help me!

13:49.047 --> 13:50.870
Help me!

13:51.871 --> 13:52.847
Come 'ere, you!

14:01.331 --> 14:04.769
I'm sorry, Applejack!
I don't know how to make it stop!

14:04.995 --> 14:07.352
Well, I know somepony who might.

14:11.135 --> 14:14.318
Three cutie marks? Three talents!

14:14.319 --> 14:16.117
I've never seen anything like it!

14:16.118 --> 14:19.356
I was just reading something
about unusual equine illnesses.

14:19.785 --> 14:21.176
What was it?

14:22.793 --> 14:24.776
"Perplexing Pony Plagues", perhaps?

14:25.978 --> 14:28.437
Yes, Spike! You're amazing!

14:29.263 --> 14:32.116
Yes, well, I do have some talents.

14:37.235 --> 14:40.120
Hay fever... the trots...

14:40.960 --> 14:42.224
Cutie pox!

14:42.225 --> 14:44.255
Cutie pox?!

14:44.332 --> 14:47.506
Cutie pox – this puzzling
pony plague afflicted...

14:47.507 --> 14:50.547
...the population of ponies
back in the paleopony period!

14:50.942 --> 14:53.048
Say that ten times fast.

14:55.102 --> 14:58.076
Random cutie marks appeared
all over the ponies' bodies...

14:58.077 --> 15:01.008
...causing them to perform all
the talents that came with them.

15:01.009 --> 15:02.839
Just like me!

15:02.898 --> 15:05.760
Yes, but what's the cure?
What's the cure?

15:08.109 --> 15:10.153
It says here there's no known cure.

15:10.154 --> 15:12.372
No known cure?!

15:13.151 --> 15:15.478
The cause of the breakout
was never discovered.

15:15.479 --> 15:18.681
And the cutie pox disappeared
as mysteriously as they arrived.

15:19.116 --> 15:20.552
Oh no!

15:22.561 --> 15:25.789
Sacré bleu! Plus de marque de cutie!
[Good heavens! Another cutie mark!]

15:26.551 --> 15:29.467
Qu'est-ce que c'est? Je parle français?
[What's that? I speak French?]

15:30.099 --> 15:32.680
My sister's speakin' in Fancy!

15:32.764 --> 15:33.841
She needs help!

15:33.842 --> 15:37.517
I know she needs help!
We can't just wait for this to go away.

15:37.518 --> 15:41.479
We gotta find somepony
to mix up a cure! And fast.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.358
Tout suite!
[Now!]

15:42.359 --> 15:45.709
Not somepony. Some zebra!

15:46.621 --> 15:48.447
Zecora!

15:53.535 --> 15:55.449
Hurry! Hurry!

15:55.450 --> 15:57.262
Dépêchez-vous!
[Hurry up!]

16:28.641 --> 16:29.231
She's cursed!

16:30.569 --> 16:31.441
Hexed!

16:32.742 --> 16:34.548
Enchanted!

16:34.594 --> 16:36.154
No, she's not.

16:37.532 --> 16:41.799
She just has some weird, mysterious disease
with no known cure, called cutie pox.

16:42.387 --> 16:44.308
CUTIE POX?!

16:55.944 --> 16:59.501
I thought I have removed their fear
the last time I visited here.

16:59.502 --> 17:02.529
But doors are barred and shutters shut.

17:02.530 --> 17:05.560
Guess I should have
stayed inside my hut.

17:05.561 --> 17:08.880
Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox.

17:10.808 --> 17:13.301
We were just on our way
to see if you've had a cure!

17:13.302 --> 17:16.678
But magically you're here!
Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?

17:16.679 --> 17:19.324
My zebra sense did not bring me 'round.

17:19.325 --> 17:22.151
It was a special flower
that I needed found.

17:22.152 --> 17:25.769
I thought I picked enough to fix
all the potions I had to mix...

17:25.770 --> 17:28.065
...but after my visit from Apple Bloom...

17:28.066 --> 17:32.015
...some have mysteriously left my room.

17:32.016 --> 17:36.283
Apple Bloom, what do you say?
Did this flower just walk away?

17:39.686 --> 17:41.482
I... um...

17:47.027 --> 17:49.684
A cutie pox cure I have forsooth.

17:50.113 --> 17:54.201
For healing power is
in the seeds of truth.

17:54.447 --> 17:56.845
W... well then. Give 'em to her! Quick!

17:57.077 --> 17:59.632
These seeds must be
planted in the ground.

17:59.633 --> 18:03.345
With the truth they'll grow
and the cure is found.

18:03.992 --> 18:04.944
Come again?

18:04.945 --> 18:09.211
The seeds of truth do hold the cure,
but one must speak words...

18:09.515 --> 18:11.853
...true and pure.

18:14.720 --> 18:15.826
Well then, let's get to it!

18:19.723 --> 18:21.195
Alright. They're planted.

18:21.196 --> 18:23.903
Now somepony tell the truth!

18:35.241 --> 18:38.422
Somepony! Anypony!

18:42.032 --> 18:44.331
Yesterday I told Mrs. Cake
that I ate two corn cakes...

18:44.332 --> 18:45.761
...but I really ate three!

18:50.591 --> 18:52.883
Okay, six! I ate six corn cakes!

18:58.565 --> 19:02.593
Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!!!

19:03.617 --> 19:06.775
Oh, I can't stand it anymore!

19:06.776 --> 19:11.717
It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn
my cutie mark! They're all fake!

19:17.515 --> 19:21.370
I figured the heart's desire would
help me get what I wanted most...

19:21.371 --> 19:25.423
...so when Zecora left her hut,
I mixed up a special potion...

19:25.424 --> 19:27.558
...and put the rest
of the heart's desire in it!

19:33.303 --> 19:35.709
Whoa...

19:46.884 --> 19:47.975
Apple Bloom!

19:48.135 --> 19:49.274
Are you okay?

19:49.275 --> 19:53.290
I'm great. And I've never been
happier to be a blank flank.

19:54.010 --> 19:57.600
But I'm awful sorry I lied.
Especially to you, girls.

19:58.183 --> 20:01.829
I was so desperate for my cutie mark,
I just got carried away.

20:02.437 --> 20:05.896
And I'm really sorry I snuck those
flowers from you, Zecora.

20:05.897 --> 20:09.644
Why, I wouldn't blame you if you
never wanted me to come by again.

20:09.890 --> 20:12.592
Now, Apple Bloom. Do not be silly.

20:12.593 --> 20:15.043
You are always welcome, my little filly.

20:15.044 --> 20:21.036
With each mistake you learn something new,
growing up into a better you.

20:23.608 --> 20:26.829
Apple Bloom, would you mind
writing to Princess Celestia...

20:26.830 --> 20:28.337
...and telling her what you learned?

20:28.338 --> 20:31.143
I'd be happy to, Twilight. Spike!

20:31.318 --> 20:32.311
Ready!

20:33.321 --> 20:35.138
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:35.139 --> 20:38.199
"Waiting for what your heart
desires can be really hard."

20:38.200 --> 20:40.332
"So you may try to take a shortcut."

20:40.333 --> 20:45.061
"But this dishonesty never works, because
you didn't earn what your heart desires."

20:45.062 --> 20:48.267
"The only cure is being honest
with yourself and others."

20:48.268 --> 20:50.942
"And that's something
every heart desires."

20:54.642 --> 20:56.272
I sure am proud of you, sis.

20:56.273 --> 20:59.592
Seems like you've finally learned
the importance of patience.

20:59.593 --> 21:03.152
Yep! All good things
come to those who wait.

21:06.227 --> 21:07.637
Well, I've waited long enough.

21:09.473 --> 21:11.601
Actually, that was way too long.

21:11.602 --> 21:12.204
What?

21:12.205 --> 21:15.104
So what are we gonna do today
to earn our cutie marks?

21:15.373 --> 21:16.884
Well, I was thinking.

21:16.885 --> 21:19.165
For a pony, who's never
mixed up a potion before...

21:19.166 --> 21:21.301
...you sure stirred up something fierce.

21:21.302 --> 21:24.142
Yeah! So what if your talent
is potion making?

21:24.608 --> 21:28.537
Oh my gosh! Totally!
Let's go talk to Zecora! Now!

21:28.861 --> 21:30.934
-Yeah!
-Woohoo!

21:32.929 --> 21:36.429
