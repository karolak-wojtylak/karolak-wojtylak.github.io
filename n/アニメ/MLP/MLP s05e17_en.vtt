00:02.750 --> 00:06.600
Aw, snickerdoodle!
Where is the darn thing?

00:07.400 --> 00:10.500
I wish for once I'd remember
to label these boxes.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.410
Big Mac, be a dear and
help me move those.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.800
Maybe it's in that
one on the bottom.

00:25.350 --> 00:28.060
Oh, dagnabbit, it's
not in there either.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.850
You can't catch me! Hey!

00:32.850 --> 00:35.350
OK! Ha ha ha! You trickster!

00:36.400 --> 00:39.230
Sisterhooves Social is
right around the corner.

00:39.550 --> 00:42.900
Thought it'd be nice to award
the winner of the big race

00:42.900 --> 00:45.950
a ribbon from when we hosted
the very first Social.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.780
If of course I can
find the darn thing.

00:52.950 --> 00:55.100
Awww, would ya lookie here?

00:55.700 --> 00:58.900
My, how Apple Bloom used
to love watching you

00:58.900 --> 01:03.200
make that thing fly. It's like
she thought you were magic.

01:04.100 --> 01:05.300
All right, enough
reminiscin'.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.750
Gotta find that ribbon.

01:10.950 --> 01:11.900
If you would just
help me

01:14.850 --> 01:16.400
then maybe I can ...

01:16.800 --> 01:17.850
Uh, Big Mac?

01:21.800 --> 01:22.480
Found 'er!

01:30.050 --> 01:42.350

We have muffins!
https://yayponies.eu/

02:01.700 --> 02:07.390
S-I-S-T-E-R-S! Which two
sisters are the best? We are!

02:07.390 --> 02:11.860
Apple Bloom and Applejack
forever. Yeeee-hewww!

02:12.100 --> 02:14.100
We are gonna win
every competition

02:14.100 --> 02:15.500
at the Sisterhooves
Social!

02:15.700 --> 02:17.700
Those other fillies aren't
gonna know what hit 'em.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.530
Oh, hey there, Big Mac.
Did you want something?

02:20.540 --> 02:21.670
Eyup.

02:21.850 --> 02:22.600
Hold that thought.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.000
Applejack, you are the
most awesome sister ever.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.140
Aw, gee whiz. Heh.

02:28.250 --> 02:31.200
Well, I think it's sweet that
you hold that opinion, but--

02:31.200 --> 02:33.550
It's not opinion.
It's objective fact.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.350
You've saved Equestria
like a gazillion times.

02:36.450 --> 02:38.350
You're smart. Funny. Strong.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.450
Why you're the best
sister of all time!

02:40.650 --> 02:44.150
Probably the best Apple of
all time! Right, Big Mac?

02:44.900 --> 02:45.800
Eyup.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.100
And with you by my
side, I am guaranteed

02:49.100 --> 02:52.170
to taste sweet, sweet
Sisterhooves Social victory!

02:52.300 --> 02:55.350
Go Apples. Go,
go, go Apples, go!

02:55.800 --> 02:58.950
Uh, Apple Bloom? I think
Big Mac's got something

02:58.950 --> 02:59.850
he wants to show you.

03:06.850 --> 03:09.400
Oh, hey! Is that the toy we used
to play with when I was little?

03:09.550 --> 03:10.200
Eyup.

03:10.550 --> 03:13.800
Neat. All right then! Let's
get back to practicin'!

03:19.600 --> 03:21.700
One more run-through of
our juggling routine,

03:22.150 --> 03:24.150
make sure our harmonies
are tight on our song,

03:24.450 --> 03:26.800
and see if we can't beat
our best pie-eatin' time.

03:27.300 --> 03:30.470
Hold on, sugar cube. I need a
minute to talk with Big Mac.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.050
Mind if I go ahead and
start eating this pie?

03:38.710 --> 03:40.740
Hey Big Mac, you all right?

03:41.600 --> 03:42.340
Eyup.

03:42.770 --> 03:45.540
You sure? You seemed a
little down back there.

03:46.550 --> 03:47.200
Nope.

03:49.540 --> 03:53.340
Come on, you can tell me. You
feelin' a little left out?

03:53.650 --> 03:55.910
Apple Bloom and I have been
spendin' a lot of time together

03:55.910 --> 03:57.000
gettin' ready for the Social.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.080
What in the--?

04:01.880 --> 04:02.940
Your Cutie Mark!

04:03.200 --> 04:06.600
You're being summoned,
Applejack! This is so cool!

04:08.000 --> 04:08.620
Eyup.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.280
Wonder where you're
being called to?

04:11.020 --> 04:12.880
Wonder what you're supposed
to do when you get there?

04:13.080 --> 04:16.340
Obviously it is something
awesome because you're awesome!

04:17.220 --> 04:20.200
But if you're being summoned
to solve a friendship problem,

04:20.400 --> 04:22.420
that means you'll have to
miss the Sisterhooves Social.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.170
And if you have to
miss the Social,

04:24.260 --> 04:25.600
then I'll have to
miss the Social,

04:25.760 --> 04:28.650
which means I won't be able to
taste sweet, sweet victory!

04:31.200 --> 04:34.770
Now calm down. Let me just
go over to Twilight's castle

04:34.770 --> 04:35.620
and see what's what.

04:36.770 --> 04:38.970
Maybe it's just a false alarm.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.910
But you said it
was a false alarm!

04:43.110 --> 04:45.400
I said "maybe"
it's a false alarm.

04:45.820 --> 04:49.080
Well, it's not. Rarity and
I have to go to Manehattan.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.750
Can't you just tell that map

04:50.750 --> 04:52.220
it'll have to wait
a couple days?

04:52.510 --> 04:53.950
No can do, sugar cube.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.880
When duty calls, I
gotta answer right away.

04:57.250 --> 05:00.000
What kind of an example would I
be settin' for my little sister

05:00.020 --> 05:00.730
if I didn't?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.510
This. Can't. Be. Happening!

05:03.770 --> 05:06.910
Your extreme awesomeness
is backfiring on me!

05:08.100 --> 05:09.600
I'm sorry,
Apple Bloom.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.040
Try and cheer her
up, won't you?

05:12.250 --> 05:13.050
Eyup.

05:15.770 --> 05:18.410
Breakfast! Come an' git it!

05:29.050 --> 05:33.020
Oh, it's no use, Big Mac.
If I know my Apple Bloom,

05:33.020 --> 05:35.000
she won't come out
of a funk this funky

05:35.020 --> 05:36.660
till her big sister gets back.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.600
Hey Apple Bloom, the Social is
going to start in a few hours.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.940
Thought you might
wanna go with us.

05:45.110 --> 05:47.140
Since Rarity and
Applejack are out of town,

05:47.370 --> 05:50.370
you and Sweetie Belle can cheer
on me and Rainbow Dash instead.

05:50.740 --> 05:52.400
Pretty great they're
letting you participate,

05:52.420 --> 05:54.480
even though you're not
technically sisters.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.650
Social's always had a
pretty loose definition

05:57.650 --> 05:59.310
of what consti-ma-tutes
a sister.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.020
Long as you share a bond
that represents the spirit

06:02.020 --> 06:03.770
of the Social, you're in.

06:04.050 --> 06:05.200
So...what do you say?

06:05.480 --> 06:06.080
You coming?

06:06.420 --> 06:09.250
Why not? I got
nothin' better to do.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.870
Let me wash up and I'll
meet you in a little bit.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.250
Oh, such a shame we
don't live closer

06:17.250 --> 06:19.110
to all your second cousins.

06:19.370 --> 06:22.420
You could maybe do the Social
with one of them instead.

06:24.940 --> 06:27.250
What is it, Big Mac?
Y'all got an idea?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.510
Eyup.

06:28.850 --> 06:29.880
What? What is it?

06:37.340 --> 06:38.710
Today's our big day!

06:39.080 --> 06:40.880
We have so got this!

06:41.140 --> 06:42.200
I'm gonna go sign us in.

06:44.220 --> 06:45.570
I guess I'm just
a little jealous

06:45.570 --> 06:47.250
you two get to
compete and I don't.

06:47.620 --> 06:49.570
But at least I get to be
here and cheer you on.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.010
I thought Apple Bloom was
going to be here, too.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.400
Guess she changed her mind.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.420
Hey! There you are.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.020
You ready to cheer on me and
Rainbow Dash to victory?

07:00.280 --> 07:01.880
Uh, not exactly.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.570
Seems I'm gonna get to
participate after all.

07:05.370 --> 07:07.770
Applejack is back from
Manehattan already?

07:08.620 --> 07:10.800
That must mean
Rarity is back, too!

07:11.370 --> 07:13.650
No. Our sisters are still gone.

07:14.020 --> 07:18.340
But it, uh, turns out my long
lost cousin Orchard Blossom

07:18.340 --> 07:20.000
was able to make it last minute.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.170
Your cousin whowhatnow?

07:24.440 --> 07:28.140
Well, I
do declare it's hotter today

07:28.140 --> 07:31.250
than the business end of
a corn cob pipe.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.140
Oh my, I am so delighted to
meet your little friends,

07:48.140 --> 07:48.970
Apple Bloom.

07:49.310 --> 07:53.020
Would these be your dear and
beloved Cutie Mark Crusaders?

07:54.850 --> 07:56.450
Sweetie Belle
and Scootaloo,

07:56.770 --> 07:58.170
Cousin Orchard Blossom.

07:58.450 --> 08:02.620
It is my extraordinary pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

08:04.420 --> 08:05.880
That's Big Mac in a dress.

08:06.910 --> 08:11.820
"Big Mac?" Why as charmed
as I am that you find me

08:11.820 --> 08:16.480
in the slightest resemblance to
such a fine and noble product

08:16.480 --> 08:20.770
of the Apple clan, I'm
astonished in equal measure.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.880
However, I shall take this
startling observation

08:23.880 --> 08:26.770
under advisement, given that
it's from such an astute

08:26.770 --> 08:30.000
and perceptive filly as
yourself, Sweetie Belle.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.170
That's awful nice of you to
say, Cousin Orchard Blossom.

08:33.420 --> 08:35.200
I've been told before
I'm pretty observant.

08:35.510 --> 08:37.450
I haven't the slightest doubt.

08:38.910 --> 08:40.140
Pardon me,

08:44.650 --> 08:48.660
my dearest cousin Applejack is
regrettably unable to be here

08:48.660 --> 08:53.050
as planned, so I, her
Cousin Orchard Blossom,

08:53.280 --> 08:55.820
will accompany Apple
Bloom in her stead.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.400
I trust that's acceptable
to all concerned?

09:01.870 --> 09:04.340
Cousin Orchard Blossom, huh?

09:04.820 --> 09:06.840
I know Applejack has
a lot of relatives,

09:06.840 --> 09:09.710
but I feel like she
would have mentioned you.

09:12.140 --> 09:15.280
Why, you must be Rainbow Dash!

09:15.570 --> 09:20.220
You're Scootaloo's... how
are y'all related again?

09:21.850 --> 09:23.910
Why don't I just let
you finish signing in?

09:24.560 --> 09:27.160
But don't think me and Scootaloo
are gonna take it easy on you

09:27.160 --> 09:28.370
just 'cause you're a stallion.

09:30.310 --> 09:31.740
Now where were we?

09:33.740 --> 09:37.570
Um, excuse me, I have
to... go to the bathroom.

09:39.570 --> 09:42.080
You mean "powder your
muzzle," don't you, dear?

09:42.420 --> 09:46.310
Such a more feminine-like
reference to nature's call,

09:46.310 --> 09:47.310
don't you agree?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.600
Have they called your
brother's bluff yet?

09:55.970 --> 09:59.630
No, but they're about to.
I can't bear to watch.

09:59.820 --> 10:03.060
Yoo hoo, Apple Bloom!

10:03.250 --> 10:05.900
They've approved us
as a pair!

10:06.680 --> 10:08.020
Hurry along now, precious.

10:08.420 --> 10:09.910
I can't believe they bought it.

10:10.250 --> 10:14.040
It's sweet he wants to help you
out like this. Weird. But sweet.

10:19.310 --> 10:23.380
Bravo. Bravo! Weren't
those two sisters great?

10:23.620 --> 10:25.800
Now where are our
next competitors?

10:26.110 --> 10:27.690
Here we are!

10:34.930 --> 10:36.300
This one please.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.850
Excellent choice... ma'am.

10:40.020 --> 10:41.570
You sure you know all the words?

10:41.800 --> 10:44.910
cause it took Applejack a pretty
long time to get it down.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.400
Did it now?

10:53.920 --> 10:56.780
<i> âª We all love our brothers âª</i>

10:56.790 --> 10:59.290
<i>âª and our fathers and mothers âª</i>

10:59.290 --> 11:04.690
<i> âª We honour them like</i>
<i> every family should âª</i>

11:04.690 --> 11:07.930
<i> âª But there's something</i>
<i> that's quite unique âª</i>

11:07.930 --> 11:10.830
<i> âª When my sister's</i>
<i> there with me âª</i>

11:10.830 --> 11:16.400
<i> âª And we share that special</i>
<i> bond of sisterhood âª</i>

11:16.410 --> 11:19.810
<i> âª Sisterhood...</i>
<i> [Sisterhooooood] âª</i>

11:19.810 --> 11:22.680
<i>âª Is a special kind of friend âª</i>

11:22.680 --> 11:25.780
âª Sisterhood...
[Sisterhooooood] âª

11:25.780 --> 11:29.820
<i> âª Is a bond that never ends âª</i>

11:29.820 --> 11:31.850
<i> âª It's not always perfect âª</i>

11:31.850 --> 11:35.060
<i> âª You might fight or</i>
<i> be misunderstood âª</i>

11:35.060 --> 11:37.680
<i> âª But together</i>
<i> you'll always have âª</i>

11:37.680 --> 11:40.760
<i> âª Sisterhood âª</i>

11:40.760 --> 11:43.460
<i> âª Sisterhood...... âª</i>

11:43.470 --> 11:44.960
<i> âª Sisterhood...... âª</i>

11:44.970 --> 11:46.430
<i> âª Sisterhood...... âª</i>

11:46.440 --> 11:48.030
<i> âª Sisterhood...... âª</i>

11:48.040 --> 11:49.470
<i> âª Sisterhood...... âª</i>

11:49.470 --> 11:53.550
<i>âª Sisterhooooooood.... âª</i>

12:04.390 --> 12:07.890
Heh heh! Are you OK,
Cousin Orchard Blossom?

12:07.890 --> 12:10.050
You sounded like you
were catching a cold

12:10.100 --> 12:11.150
or something else

12:11.150 --> 12:13.390
that would make your voice
sound totally different

12:13.400 --> 12:15.050
right at the end
of the song.

12:17.450 --> 12:19.500
Just a frog in
my throat, dear.

12:19.750 --> 12:22.340
Probably just need to
get a sip of water.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.800
If you'll excuse us,

12:23.810 --> 12:26.500
we've another event in
which to participate.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.600
Oh, my, that certainly
didn't go as I had planned.

12:32.700 --> 12:33.850
But don't you worry.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.400
We'll get you a blue
ribbon, yet, Apple Bloom.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.000
You sure about that?

12:38.450 --> 12:41.950
As sure as my name is
Cousin Orchard Blossom.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.060
But that isn't your name.

12:45.830 --> 12:47.990
C-O-U-S-I-N-S!

12:48.000 --> 12:52.530
Which two sisters, er,
cousins, are the best? We are!

12:52.530 --> 12:56.400
Apple Bloom and Applejack,
I mean Orchard Jack,

12:56.400 --> 13:00.750
Blossom forever. Yay!

13:04.450 --> 13:06.000
Yay.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.350
Oh, I don't know
why I didn't choose

13:33.380 --> 13:35.480
to wear something more casual.

13:35.650 --> 13:39.050
Why I knew that juggling routine
like the back of my hoof.

13:39.450 --> 13:42.200
But never you mind, there is
still the race to be run.

13:42.650 --> 13:45.200
I really appreciate
all the effort Big Ma--

13:45.800 --> 13:49.300
Cousin Orchard Blossom,
but maybe we just skip

13:49.300 --> 13:52.000
the whole obstacle course
thing and call it a day.

13:52.250 --> 13:55.500
Why, Apple Bloom, I
wouldn't hear of it.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.500
Your Cousin Orchard
Blossom may be many things,

13:58.500 --> 14:00.600
but she is not a quitter.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.400
I'm sure she's not. But,
it's like Applejack said,

14:04.600 --> 14:06.800
there'll be more Sisterhooves
Socials down the line.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.380
I'm sure she'll help me get a
blue ribbon next time around.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.480
But you wanted to win at
this Sisterhooves Social.

14:13.650 --> 14:17.700
And no matter what, I am
going to get you that win.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.620
Why I simply have to.

14:29.650 --> 14:31.030
All right, Scootaloo,

14:31.030 --> 14:33.930
remember the parts where
teamwork really comes into play.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.640
How could I forget? We've
been training all week.

14:37.150 --> 14:40.150
OK, hot stuff. What's our
move on the grape squish?

14:40.150 --> 14:40.880
The alley oop.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.600
Apple Toss?

14:41.600 --> 14:42.300
Flip flop.

14:42.300 --> 14:42.800
Egg carry?

14:42.800 --> 14:43.600
Flutter bomb.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.950
Yeah!

14:47.600 --> 14:49.150
Oh, dear.

14:49.550 --> 14:53.700
Competisisters,
take your positions.

14:58.230 --> 15:02.500
And ready. And set. Go!

15:06.400 --> 15:07.900
Nice jump, Scoot!

15:23.080 --> 15:25.100
Woohoo!

16:09.560 --> 16:12.000
Yikes! You almost squished ME!

16:21.740 --> 16:23.650
Pick up those
hooves, Apple Bloom!

16:23.650 --> 16:26.480
Why you're barely
moving at a mosey!

16:30.990 --> 16:32.050
Come on, junebug;

16:32.050 --> 16:34.700
it's like you've never
carried an egg before.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.800
I'm goin' as fast as I can!

16:44.470 --> 16:45.400
Hey!

16:51.670 --> 16:53.410
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

17:03.480 --> 17:06.090
Woo-hoo!

17:09.220 --> 17:13.450
I mean, victory is
ours, sweet Apple Bloom!

17:16.430 --> 17:17.430
Uh-oh.

17:17.430 --> 17:19.350
Uh-oh, indeed.

17:21.350 --> 17:23.700
I should have known
you'd eventually get busted

17:23.700 --> 17:25.240
for being a stallion.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.610
Oh, no. We've
known all along.

17:27.610 --> 17:30.610
The Sisterhooves Social has
always had a loose policy

17:30.610 --> 17:33.150
when it comes to what
counts as a "sister".

17:34.100 --> 17:37.420
But we do have a strict policy
when it comes to sportsponyship.

17:37.420 --> 17:42.000
In your "sister's" desperation
to win, he used brute strength

17:42.000 --> 17:44.300
to physically take
out the competitors.

17:44.830 --> 17:48.630
That kind of behavior is not
just unbecoming of a lady,

17:48.630 --> 17:51.050
but, quite frankly, of anypony.

17:51.400 --> 17:56.050
And for that, you two
are hereby disqualified.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.650
Looks like we win, squirt.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.150
Woo-hoo!

18:06.450 --> 18:09.350
I told you I should have just
waited until the next social

18:09.350 --> 18:10.550
to win with Applejack.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.840
You know, I'm not
mad, right?

18:30.100 --> 18:31.050
Eyup.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.870
I mean, let's face it,

18:33.880 --> 18:36.500
you dressing up as my
Cousin Orchard Blossom

18:36.500 --> 18:39.780
was a pretty crazy idea
in the first place.

18:39.780 --> 18:40.600
Eyup.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.900
And it's not like you got me
disqualified from the Social

18:44.900 --> 18:46.150
forever or anything.

18:46.490 --> 18:50.100
I can participate next time with
Applejack. Everything's fine.

18:50.790 --> 18:51.600
Eyup.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.100
I just don't understand
why you went so crazy there

18:56.100 --> 18:57.330
at the end of the race.

18:57.330 --> 19:00.000
I mean, I know you like
to win and all, but...

19:00.670 --> 19:02.900
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

19:02.900 --> 19:03.850
Nope.

19:04.910 --> 19:09.240
All right. Well, it's
getting late. You coming?

19:09.240 --> 19:10.100
Nope.

19:11.180 --> 19:14.280
OK. See you
later, I guess.

19:17.580 --> 19:18.720
Apple Bloom?

19:18.720 --> 19:19.700
Yeah?

19:20.420 --> 19:22.890
When you were little, you
used to look up to me.

19:22.890 --> 19:25.750
Thought I was the best
thing since zap-apple jam.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.360
Things are different now.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.500
Applejack's the hero
of the Apple family.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.800
Always rushin' off
to save Equestria.

19:34.370 --> 19:37.100
And I'm just here on
the farm. Doin' chores.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.650
Helpin' out the way I can.

19:38.650 --> 19:41.900
Nothin' special. Nobody's hero.
I guess I just thought...

19:42.550 --> 19:46.850
Aw, never mind. Here I am
about to start blabberin' on

19:46.850 --> 19:49.650
about my feelings. You don't
want to hear all this.

19:49.900 --> 19:50.950
Yes, I do.

19:51.650 --> 19:55.400
I guess I just thought if I
could fill in for Applejack

19:55.400 --> 19:57.550
at the Social and get
you a blue ribbon,

19:57.550 --> 20:00.450
well, I could be somepony
you looked up to again.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.400
Be your hero again. Even
if it was for just a day.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.700
It was foolish.
And I'm ashamed.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.570
Please. I just want
to be alone right now.

20:15.410 --> 20:18.210
Yeah well, too
bad, you big goof.

20:18.210 --> 20:20.410
'Cause I'm not
going anywhere.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.750
And I know that you're always
gonna be here when I need you.

20:24.520 --> 20:28.350
Heck, you'll do a whole
obstacle course in high heels

20:28.350 --> 20:30.650
if you think it'll help
me get somethin' I want.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.000
You're my big brother.

20:33.360 --> 20:37.650
You've always been a hero to me,
Big Mac, and you always will be.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.200
I'm real sorry I haven't
been lettin' you know

20:40.200 --> 20:41.600
that's how I feel.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.950
Guess both of us have
been holdin' back

20:43.950 --> 20:46.350
when it comes to
expressin' ourselves, huh?

20:46.710 --> 20:47.600
Eyup.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.480
Big Mac! Apple Bloom!

20:51.480 --> 20:54.480
Your sister's home! She says
she's got quite a story to tell

20:54.480 --> 20:56.380
about her trip to Manehattan.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.900
Be there in a bit.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.150
I'm spending some quality
time with my big brother!

21:05.930 --> 21:07.530
Hey, Big Mac.

21:07.530 --> 21:08.830
Eyup.

21:08.830 --> 21:10.850
How do you think
Cousin Orchard Blossom

21:10.850 --> 21:12.150
would describe this sunset?

21:13.640 --> 21:18.050
Why, dear, I do declare this
is the most beautiful sunset

21:18.050 --> 21:20.340
my eyes have ever looked upon.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.200
Though sittin' here
on these tree roots

21:22.200 --> 21:25.010
is a trifle uncomfortable
for my hindquarters.
