WEBVTT

00:09.923 --> 00:14.300
It is gorgeous out.
Just gorgeous!

00:21.804 --> 00:25.565
Twilight! I... have...

00:26.552 --> 00:27.553
lemme just...

00:33.052 --> 00:34.314
Dear Twilight,

00:34.465 --> 00:38.612
I am sure you are as excited as I am
about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot.

00:38.763 --> 00:40.209
Wedding?!

00:40.360 --> 00:44.052
I will be presiding over the ceremony,
but would very much like you and your friends

00:44.203 --> 00:46.582
to help with the preparations
for this wonderful occasion.

00:46.733 --> 00:50.344
Fluttershy, I would like you and your
songbird choir to provide the music.

00:50.495 --> 00:52.819
Oh my goodness! What an honor!

00:52.970 --> 00:57.236
Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more
qualified than you to host the reception.

00:59.703 --> 01:02.902
Applejack, you will be in charge
of the catering for the reception.

01:03.053 --> 01:05.456
Well, color me pleased as punch!

01:05.607 --> 01:09.252
Rainbow Dash, I would very much
appreciate it if you could perform

01:09.403 --> 01:12.552
a sonic rainboom as the bride
and groom complete their I do's.

01:12.703 --> 01:13.703
Yes!

01:13.854 --> 01:16.952
Rarity, you will be responsible
for designing the dresses

01:17.103 --> 01:18.853
for the bride and her bridesmaids.

01:19.004 --> 01:21.432
Princess Celestia wants me to...

01:22.152 --> 01:23.762
...wedding dress?

01:24.173 --> 01:26.289
For a Canterlot wedding...

01:29.328 --> 01:33.563
And as for you, Twilight, you will be
playing the most important role of all:

01:33.714 --> 01:35.892
making sure that everything
goes as planned.

01:36.043 --> 01:39.455
See you all very soon.
Yours, Princess Celestia.

01:41.412 --> 01:44.646
But... I don't understand.
Who's getting married?

01:44.797 --> 01:45.704
Oh, wait!

01:46.387 --> 01:49.408
I was probably supposed
to give you this one first.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.996
Princess Celestia cordially
invites you to the wedding of

01:53.147 --> 01:55.686
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza,
and...

01:55.837 --> 01:57.632
my brother?!

02:01.146 --> 02:06.146

02:37.049 --> 02:38.819
Your brother's getting married?

02:38.970 --> 02:42.261
Congratulations, Twilight,
that's great news!

02:42.412 --> 02:46.119
Yeah, great news... that I just got
from a wedding invitation!

02:46.319 --> 02:49.319
Not from my brother,
but from a piece of paper!

02:49.470 --> 02:51.270
Thanks a lot, Shining Armor.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.798
I mean, really,
he couldn't tell me personally?

02:54.249 --> 02:56.733
<i>Hey, Twilight,
just thought you should know...</i>

02:56.884 --> 02:59.232
<i>I'm making a really big decision
that changes everything.</i>

02:59.383 --> 03:02.500
<i>Oh, nevermind, you'll hear about it
when you get the invitation.</i>

03:02.919 --> 03:06.774
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza?
Who in the hoof is that?!

03:08.294 --> 03:10.642
Twilight? Are you okay?

03:10.793 --> 03:14.619
Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor
and I have always been so close.

03:14.770 --> 03:16.169
He's my B.B.B.F.F!

03:18.883 --> 03:20.872
Big Brother Best Friend Forever?

03:22.519 --> 03:25.229
Before I came here and learned
the importance of friendship,

03:25.380 --> 03:28.939
Shining Armor was the only pony
I ever really accepted as a friend.

03:33.956 --> 03:38.477
<i>When I was just a filly,
I found it rather silly</i>

03:38.628 --> 03:43.064
<i>To see how many other ponies I could meet</i>

03:43.215 --> 03:47.496
<i>I had my books to read,
didn't know that I would ever need</i>

03:47.647 --> 03:51.687
<i>Other ponies to make my life complete</i>

03:51.838 --> 03:54.599
<i>But there was one colt that I cared for</i>

03:54.750 --> 03:58.665
<i>I knew he would be there for me</i>

03:58.816 --> 04:02.709
<i>My big brother,
best friend forever</i>

04:03.204 --> 04:08.171
<i>Like two peas in a pod,
we did everything together</i>

04:08.670 --> 04:11.127
<i>He taught me how to fly a kite</i>

04:11.128 --> 04:13.259
<i>He taught me how to fly a kite
(Best friend forever)</i>

04:13.411 --> 04:15.901
<i>We never had a single fight</i>

04:15.902 --> 04:17.949
<i>We never had a single fight
(We did everything together)</i>

04:18.100 --> 04:22.132
<i>We shared our hopes,
we shared our dreams</i>

04:22.283 --> 04:25.933
<i>I miss him more than I realized</i>

04:26.084 --> 04:28.047
<i>It seems...</i>

04:28.198 --> 04:32.513
<i>Your big brother,
best friend forever</i>

04:32.664 --> 04:37.678
<i>Like two peas in a pod,
you did everything together</i>

04:38.129 --> 04:43.819
<i>And though he's so far away,
I hoped that he would stay</i>

04:44.290 --> 04:48.450
<i>My Big Brother Best Friend</i>

04:48.601 --> 04:52.939
<i>Forever</i>

04:53.097 --> 04:58.288
<i>Forever...</i>

05:03.874 --> 05:05.819
As one of your PFFs...

05:07.770 --> 05:09.544
Pony Friends Forever...

05:10.693 --> 05:14.322
I wanna tell you that I think your
brother sounds like a real good guy.

05:14.819 --> 05:16.528
He is pretty special.

05:16.679 --> 05:19.630
I mean, they don't let just anypony
be Captain of the Royal Guard.

05:20.998 --> 05:22.444
So let me get this straight.

05:22.595 --> 05:25.219
We're helping out with the
wedding of not only a princess,

05:25.670 --> 05:28.057
but a Captain of the Royal Guard?

05:28.819 --> 05:30.322
I guess we are.

05:40.019 --> 05:45.572
A sonic rainboom? At a wedding?!
Can you say "best wedding ever"!

05:45.723 --> 05:47.718
Best wedding ever!

05:49.588 --> 05:52.019
So you all get to help with
the big fancy wedding,

05:52.170 --> 05:54.808
but I'm the one who gets
to host the bachelor party!

05:55.019 --> 05:58.255
I have just one question,
what's a bachelor party?

06:02.279 --> 06:04.407
Why the long face, sugarcube?

06:04.558 --> 06:06.647
I'm just thinking about Shining Armor.

06:06.798 --> 06:10.089
Ever since I moved to Ponyville,
we've been seeing each other less and less.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.653
And now that he's starting
a new family with this...

06:12.804 --> 06:17.339
"Princess Mi Amore Cal-whatshername",
we'll probably never see each other.

06:17.790 --> 06:20.513
Come on, now. You're his sister.

06:20.664 --> 06:22.444
He'll always make time for you.

06:22.595 --> 06:25.390
Couldn't seem to make time
to tell me he was getting married.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.536
What's with all the guards?

06:46.687 --> 06:49.231
I'm sure they're just taking
the necessary precautions.

06:49.382 --> 06:52.404
Royal weddings do bring out
the strangest ponies.

06:56.244 --> 06:58.149
Now let's get going,
we've got work to do!

06:58.300 --> 07:01.338
And you've got a big brother
to go congratulate.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.023
Yeah. Congratulate.

07:03.174 --> 07:06.387
And then give him a piece of my mind.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.596
I've got something
to say to you, mister.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.261
Twilie!

07:25.612 --> 07:28.515
I've missed, you, kid.
How was the train ride, I-

07:28.666 --> 07:31.708
How dare you not tell me in person
that you were getting married!

07:31.859 --> 07:33.381
I'm your sister, for pony's sake!

07:34.081 --> 07:35.881
It's not my fault!

07:36.032 --> 07:39.671
Princess Celestia has requested
a major increase in security.

07:39.822 --> 07:41.496
Didn't you see all the guards
at the train station?

07:41.647 --> 07:43.681
Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up.

07:43.832 --> 07:45.232
Maybe you heard about it?

07:45.483 --> 07:47.214
It has nothing to do
with the wedding.

07:47.365 --> 07:49.978
A threat has been made
against Canterlot.

07:50.129 --> 07:54.053
We don't know who's responsible for it,
but Princess Celestia asked that

07:54.204 --> 07:55.981
I help provide additional protection.

07:57.450 --> 07:59.701
This, you need to see.

08:15.701 --> 08:20.081
The burden of keeping Canterlot safe
and secure rests squarely on my shoulders.

08:20.232 --> 08:24.008
Staying focused on the task at hand
has been my top priority.

08:27.351 --> 08:29.208
Okay, okay, I get it.

08:29.359 --> 08:31.885
You've got a really important job
protecting all of Canterlot

08:32.036 --> 08:34.309
with a force field only you
can conjure up.

08:34.760 --> 08:39.330
But still... how could you not tell me
about something as big as your wedding?

08:39.481 --> 08:41.779
Am I not that important
to you any more?

08:42.030 --> 08:44.481
Hey. You're my little sister.

08:44.632 --> 08:46.211
Of course you're important to me.

08:46.662 --> 08:51.049
But I'd understand if you didn't
want to be my best mare now.

08:52.249 --> 08:54.681
You want me to be your best mare?

08:54.982 --> 08:56.836
Well... yeah.

08:56.987 --> 08:58.387
I'd be honored!

08:59.730 --> 09:02.590
But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying
somepony I don't even know!

09:02.741 --> 09:06.142
When did you even meet this
"Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"?

09:06.293 --> 09:10.205
Twilie, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza
is Cadance.

09:10.356 --> 09:11.656
Your old foalsitter.

09:11.807 --> 09:14.391
Cadance? As in the Cadance?

09:14.542 --> 09:17.681
As in the greatest foalsitter
in all the history of foalsitters?!

09:17.981 --> 09:20.391
You tell me, she was your foalsitter.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.666
Ohmygoshohmygosh!

09:22.817 --> 09:25.609
<i>Cadance is only the
most amazing pony ever!</i>

09:25.760 --> 09:30.103
<i>She's beautiful, she's caring,
she's kind...</i>

09:31.054 --> 09:34.356
I am so lucky to have you
as my foalsitter!

09:34.507 --> 09:36.784
I'm the one who's lucky, Twilight.

09:37.482 --> 09:39.529
You're a princess.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.818
I'm just a regular old unicorn.

09:41.969 --> 09:45.717
You are anything but
a regular old unicorn.

09:46.381 --> 09:51.981
Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake,
clap your hooves and do a little shake!

09:54.981 --> 09:57.212
I am going for a hooficure
and that is that!

09:57.363 --> 09:58.795
- You are not going.
- I am. I am...

10:08.111 --> 10:10.735
<i>How many unicorns can just
spread love wherever they go?</i>

10:10.986 --> 10:12.699
<i>I only know of one!</i>

10:13.548 --> 10:15.936
And you're marrying her!

10:16.087 --> 10:19.264
You're marrying Cadance,
you're marrying Cadance!

10:19.978 --> 10:22.482
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

10:22.633 --> 10:23.647
Cadance!

10:23.798 --> 10:28.934
Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake,
clap your hooves and do a little shake!

10:29.085 --> 10:30.285
What are you doing?

10:31.089 --> 10:33.604
Cadance, it's me, Twilight!

10:39.182 --> 10:41.170
I've gotta get back to my station.

10:41.321 --> 10:44.450
But Cadance will be checking in with
all of you to see how things are going.

10:44.601 --> 10:49.604
I think I speak for both of us when I say
we couldn't be more excited to have you here.

10:49.755 --> 10:50.955
Right, dear?

10:51.106 --> 10:53.284
Absolutely.

10:53.947 --> 10:56.381
Well, we'll let you get to it.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.790
Cake, check.

11:09.977 --> 11:11.877
Ice sculpture, check.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.323
Best darn bitesize apple fritter
you ever tasted...

11:18.101 --> 11:19.215
Check.

11:19.366 --> 11:21.816
<i>I do. Do you?</i>

11:21.967 --> 11:22.967
<i>I do!</i>

11:27.202 --> 11:28.809
Hiya, Princess!

11:28.960 --> 11:32.808
Please, call me
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.530
Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.

11:35.681 --> 11:38.149
You come to check out what's
on the menu for your big day?

11:38.300 --> 11:39.561
I have!

11:46.574 --> 11:50.158
Delicious! I love, love, love them.

11:50.585 --> 11:53.415
Aw, shucks. Why don't
you take a few to go?

11:55.198 --> 11:57.538
I know how you brides can be.

11:57.689 --> 12:00.687
So busy, you forget to get
a little somethin' in your belly.

12:05.074 --> 12:06.913
Did... you see what she...

12:13.313 --> 12:15.679
Oh, you should have seen
how she acted back there.

12:15.830 --> 12:18.136
I don't know when she changed,
but she changed!

12:18.287 --> 12:21.827
<i>"Please, call me
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."</i>

12:21.978 --> 12:23.876
Did I hear someone say my name?

12:24.027 --> 12:24.827
Your highness!

12:24.978 --> 12:27.571
Let me just start by saying
what an honor it is to play a role

12:27.722 --> 12:29.861
in such a momentous occasion.

12:32.636 --> 12:34.152
Is my dress ready?

12:35.015 --> 12:36.181
Yes, of course.

12:37.032 --> 12:39.457
I've been working on it ever since
I was given the assignment.

12:39.608 --> 12:43.033
And I think you'll be pleased
with the results!

12:44.372 --> 12:47.866
I was hoping for something with
more beading and a longer train.

12:48.438 --> 12:49.881
Yes, of course.

12:50.032 --> 12:51.955
And those should be a different color.

12:52.933 --> 12:54.581
I think they're lovely.

12:54.732 --> 12:55.732
Me too.

12:55.883 --> 12:56.983
I love them.

12:58.692 --> 13:00.368
Make them a different color.

13:02.340 --> 13:05.624
Gee, maybe her name should be
"Princess Demandy-pants."

13:11.781 --> 13:12.946
Okay, let me see.

13:13.097 --> 13:14.497
We've been over the games...

13:17.956 --> 13:19.145
The dances...

13:22.179 --> 13:25.009
I think this reception is gonna
be perfect! Don't you?

13:25.260 --> 13:26.581
Perfect!

13:26.732 --> 13:29.437
...if we were celebrating
a six-year-old's birthday party.

13:30.081 --> 13:31.828
Thank you!

13:36.781 --> 13:38.469
Rest, my sister.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.747
As always, I will guard the night.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.801
Bet I can guess what
you're all thinking!

13:46.952 --> 13:50.568
Cadance is the absolute
worst bride-to-be ever.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.086
<i>Who, me?</i>

13:53.237 --> 13:55.334
Spike! That goes on the cake.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.637
Twilight, whatever are you talking about?

13:59.788 --> 14:01.626
Cadance is an absolute gem!

14:02.303 --> 14:04.400
Rarity, she was so demanding!

14:04.551 --> 14:05.690
Well of course she was!

14:05.841 --> 14:08.161
Why shouldn't she expect
the very best on her wedding day?

14:08.991 --> 14:12.862
Applejack, did you know that after she told
you how much she just 'love-love-loved'

14:13.013 --> 14:14.850
your hors-d'oeuvres,
she threw them in the trash?

14:15.101 --> 14:17.981
Aw, she was probably just
trying to spare my feelings.

14:18.455 --> 14:22.150
No, she was just being fake,
and totally insincere!

14:24.834 --> 14:27.353
She did raise her voice at one of
my birds during rehearsal.

14:27.504 --> 14:28.704
See? Rude!

14:29.716 --> 14:32.504
But... he was singing really off-key.

14:35.781 --> 14:38.577
Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed
how Cadance treated-

14:43.124 --> 14:44.303
Nevermind.

14:44.454 --> 14:46.229
Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?

14:46.480 --> 14:50.324
Sorry Twi, been too busy prepping
for my sonic rainboom

14:50.475 --> 14:53.290
to pay much attention to
the bride's bad attitude.

14:54.388 --> 14:56.331
The princess is about to get married.

14:56.482 --> 14:58.631
I'm sure any negative behavior
she might be displaying

14:58.782 --> 15:00.485
is simply the result of nerves.

15:01.682 --> 15:04.319
And I'm sure it's the result
of being an awful pony

15:04.470 --> 15:07.540
who doesn't deserve to even know
Shining Armor let alone marry him!

15:08.781 --> 15:12.430
Think maybe you're being just a tiny bit
possessive of your brother?

15:13.416 --> 15:15.340
I am not being possessive!

15:15.491 --> 15:17.917
And I am not taking it out on Cadance!

15:18.068 --> 15:19.679
You're all just too caught up
in your wedding planning

15:19.830 --> 15:22.202
to notice that maybe there
shouldn't even be a wedding!

15:34.786 --> 15:36.459
Twilie!

15:36.610 --> 15:39.434
Your big brother's looking
pretty good, don't you think?

15:41.130 --> 15:42.306
Everything okay?

15:42.457 --> 15:43.657
We need to talk.

15:43.808 --> 15:45.008
I think you're making a big-

15:46.529 --> 15:48.196
Oh, hi, sweetie.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.734
She sure has a way
of sneaking up on people.

15:50.985 --> 15:53.757
Could I speak to you for a moment,
dear?

15:54.474 --> 15:56.377
Better see what she wants.

15:58.424 --> 15:59.876
Look, we need to talk.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.027
I'm here to talk.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.063
- Look, she's okay-
- Just listen to me.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.414
I'm listening, I'm listening...

16:05.565 --> 16:08.870
I thought I made it perfectly clear
I didn't want you to wear that.

16:09.021 --> 16:11.034
This was my favorite uncle's.

16:11.184 --> 16:12.059
And...?

16:12.210 --> 16:13.970
And I think I should wear it.

16:14.121 --> 16:15.814
Are you disagreeing with me?

16:15.965 --> 16:18.125
I guess I am!

16:18.899 --> 16:22.520
Oh dear, are you getting
another one of your headaches?

16:28.118 --> 16:29.454
Feeling better?

16:31.688 --> 16:35.809
She isn't just unpleasant and rude,
she's downright evil!

16:38.834 --> 16:40.116
Twilight!

16:42.064 --> 16:43.352
Let her go.

16:44.274 --> 16:46.924
It seemed like she had something else
she wanted to tell me.

16:49.534 --> 16:51.082
Who goes there?

16:51.233 --> 16:53.686
Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle.

16:54.267 --> 16:57.060
Shining Armor's in real trouble!
You have to help-

16:58.654 --> 16:59.889
Dresses?

17:00.233 --> 17:01.244
What are you...?

17:01.394 --> 17:03.264
Can you believe it?

17:03.415 --> 17:07.464
We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore
Cadenza's new bridesmaids!

17:07.615 --> 17:09.027
"New" bridesmaids?

17:09.178 --> 17:11.384
What happened to her "old" bridesmaids?!

17:11.535 --> 17:12.535
She didn't say.

17:12.686 --> 17:16.458
But she did tell us that she would
love love love it if we'd fill in for them.

17:16.609 --> 17:18.555
Seeing as we've been working
so hard and everything.

17:18.834 --> 17:20.939
And you had your doubts about her.

17:21.090 --> 17:22.520
Told you she was an absolute gem!

17:22.671 --> 17:24.162
You sure this is what I should wear?

17:25.693 --> 17:28.177
Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.

17:28.679 --> 17:30.061
I'll see what I can do.

17:30.312 --> 17:31.637
This is so exciting!

17:31.788 --> 17:33.329
I know! This is awesome!

17:34.054 --> 17:36.408
Looks like I really am on my own.

17:43.634 --> 17:46.083
Perfect, girls. No need to rush!

17:48.500 --> 17:50.828
Then of course, Cadance will enter.

17:59.136 --> 18:02.725
I'll say a few words,
and then we'll begin with the vows.

18:02.876 --> 18:05.803
Shining Armor, you'll get
the ring from your Best Mare.

18:07.594 --> 18:08.898
Do you?

18:09.049 --> 18:10.249
I do!

18:10.400 --> 18:13.239
Hey... has anypony seen Twilight?

18:14.809 --> 18:16.147
I'm here!

18:16.333 --> 18:18.595
I'm not gonna stand next to her.

18:18.746 --> 18:20.102
And neither should you!

18:21.686 --> 18:25.367
I'm sorry, I don't know
why she's acting like this.

18:25.518 --> 18:27.264
Maybe we should just ignore her.

18:27.415 --> 18:29.304
You have to listen to me!

18:30.134 --> 18:32.375
Oh goodness! Are you okay?

18:32.526 --> 18:33.526
I'm fine.

18:33.677 --> 18:34.677
Ya sure about that?

18:35.128 --> 18:37.150
I've got something to say!

18:38.459 --> 18:40.291
She's evil!

18:45.145 --> 18:47.100
She's been horrible to my friends...

18:47.651 --> 18:50.270
She's obviously done something
to her bridesmaids...

18:50.621 --> 18:52.085
And if that wasn't enough,

18:52.236 --> 18:55.393
I saw her put a spell on my brother
that made his eyes go all...!

19:03.041 --> 19:05.745
Why are you doing this to me?!

19:05.896 --> 19:07.460
Because you're evil!

19:08.718 --> 19:12.568
Evil! And if I don't stop you,
you're gonna ruin my brother's life!

19:20.234 --> 19:23.158
You want to know why my eyes went all...?

19:24.496 --> 19:27.725
Because ever since I started having
to perform my protection spell,

19:27.876 --> 19:29.879
I've been getting terrible migraines.

19:30.030 --> 19:35.083
Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me,
she's been using her magic to heal me!

19:35.734 --> 19:38.046
And she decided to
replace her bridesmaids

19:38.197 --> 19:41.290
because she found out the only reason
they wanted to be in the wedding

19:41.441 --> 19:43.384
was so that they could
meet Canterlot royalty!

19:43.535 --> 19:45.924
And if she hasn't been on her
best behavior with your friends,

19:46.075 --> 19:49.271
it's because with me being so busy,
she's had to make all the decisions

19:49.422 --> 19:50.422
about the wedding!

19:50.573 --> 19:51.673
I was just trying to-

19:51.824 --> 19:54.211
She's completely stressed out
because it's really important to her

19:54.362 --> 19:55.962
that her big day be perfect!

19:56.363 --> 19:59.739
Something that obviously
wasn't important to you.

20:02.534 --> 20:06.928
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go and comfort my bride.

20:07.656 --> 20:10.124
And you can forget about
being my best mare.

20:10.625 --> 20:14.738
In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't
show up to the wedding at all.

20:20.549 --> 20:23.465
C'mon, y'all.
Let's go check on the princess.

20:28.571 --> 20:31.291
- I was...
- You have a lot to think about.

20:34.845 --> 20:37.216
Maybe I was being overprotective.

20:38.814 --> 20:40.638
I could've gained a sister.

20:40.789 --> 20:44.231
But instead... I just lost a brother.

20:45.259 --> 20:50.042
<i>He was my Big Brother,
Best Friend</i>

20:50.193 --> 20:54.130
<i>Forever...</i>

20:54.747 --> 20:59.434
<i>And now, we'll never do anything</i>

20:59.592 --> 21:03.809
<i>Together...</i>

21:11.652 --> 21:13.057
I'm sorry!

21:15.049 --> 21:16.566
You will be.
