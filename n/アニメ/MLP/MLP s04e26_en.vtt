WEBVTT

00:04.288 --> 00:05.711
What's wrong, Twilight?

00:05.882 --> 00:07.736
<i>It doesn't seem that my</i>
<i>new role as a Princess</i>

00:07.740 --> 00:08.969
<i>equates to all that much.</i>

00:09.239 --> 00:16.846
I am Tirek! And I will take what
should've been mine long ago!

00:17.377 --> 00:20.392
With each passing moment, he
grows stronger still.

00:20.624 --> 00:23.151
And I know just the princess
who can stop him.

00:23.334 --> 00:25.662
I'm afraid I must call in
another to stop Tirek.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.493
Oh ho! You're talking
about me I presume.

00:28.585 --> 00:31.313
Haven't you girls just
learned so much!

00:31.328 --> 00:33.276
And there's something
interesting about the sections

00:33.283 --> 00:34.400
that Discord bookmarked.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.663
Each of you received
something from the pony

00:36.673 --> 00:38.083
whose life you helped change.

00:39.217 --> 00:41.683
There's still one key
missing: my element.

00:42.085 --> 00:46.429
Join me, Discord and
reclaim your greatness.

00:46.649 --> 00:48.934
<i>Discord has betrayed</i>
<i>the ponies of Equestria</i>

00:49.229 --> 00:51.059
<i>and joined forces with Tirek.</i>

00:51.272 --> 00:54.515
<i>There is no doubt that Tirek</i>
<i>is after Alicorn magic.</i>

00:55.036 --> 00:57.521
We must rid ourselves
of our magic

00:57.621 --> 01:00.349
before Tirek has the chance
to steal it from us.

01:05.366 --> 01:12.360
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies
See you next season for more muffins ponies!</i>

01:40.200 --> 01:42.696
<i>Tirek is set on</i>
<i>possessing Alicorn magic.</i>

01:43.108 --> 01:46.064
When he comes for us, we cannot
have what he is looking for.

01:47.301 --> 01:50.171
I'm more than willing to do
my part and give up my magic.

01:50.433 --> 01:51.590
<i>You misunderstand.</i>

01:51.797 --> 01:54.495
Our magic cannot just
disappear into thin air.

01:54.827 --> 01:56.640
Somepony must keep it safe.

01:57.016 --> 01:59.356
That somepony is
you, Twilight.

01:59.584 --> 02:00.616
Why me?

02:00.774 --> 02:02.942
We do not believe
that Tirek is aware

02:02.958 --> 02:05.902
that a fourth Alicorn Princess
exists in Equestria.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.904
If we transfer our
magic to you,

02:08.152 --> 02:10.122
Tirek will not know
where it has gone.

02:10.390 --> 02:12.454
Do you understand what
we're asking of you?

02:13.051 --> 02:16.776
Yes. It's just I'm only now
learning how to control

02:16.784 --> 02:19.494
my own Alicorn magic. To
take on even more...

02:19.500 --> 02:22.602
Twilight, you represent
the Element of Magic.

02:22.878 --> 02:25.810
If there is anypony who
can do this, it's you.

02:27.879 --> 02:30.359
Taking on this task will be one
of the most difficult things

02:30.362 --> 02:31.342
I will ever do.

02:31.711 --> 02:33.090
But with the help
of my friends...

02:33.260 --> 02:34.977
I'm sorry, Princess Twilight,

02:35.164 --> 02:37.736
but you must keep your
new abilities a secret.

02:38.019 --> 02:40.839
I fear that your friends being
aware of your new power

02:41.176 --> 02:42.946
could put them at great risk.

02:43.145 --> 02:45.949
Do you still think you can
take on this responsibility?

02:46.747 --> 02:49.633
This is the role I am meant to
play as a Princess of Equestria.

02:50.048 --> 02:51.855
I will not
fail to do my duty!

02:52.310 --> 02:53.974
Then we must begin at once.

03:18.597 --> 03:19.568
That can't be right.

03:19.923 --> 03:21.137
What can't be right?

03:21.894 --> 03:23.582
Nothing. Carry on.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.002
It is done.

03:57.121 --> 03:58.782
You weren't gone very long.

03:59.092 --> 04:00.948
Does that mean
everything's OK?

04:01.358 --> 04:03.229
Yup. Everything's fine.

04:03.974 --> 04:04.472
Heh heh!

04:05.121 --> 04:07.771
In that case, I'm
going back to bed.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.782
Sun's not up, then
neither am I.

04:11.326 --> 04:13.955
That's strange; the sun
should be up by now.

04:15.252 --> 04:16.575
The sun should be up by now!

04:19.114 --> 04:20.288
You can do this.

04:41.962 --> 04:45.278
Shining Armor. Why, whatever
are you doing here?

04:45.611 --> 04:47.319
Back off, traitor.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.546
<i>The only one Discord</i>
<i>betrayed was himself.</i>

04:52.669 --> 04:55.662
Abandoning his true nature
to make "friends"

04:55.742 --> 04:58.622
with weak-minded equines
who offer him nothing.

05:11.322 --> 05:13.635
How could you do this?

05:16.538 --> 05:18.620
Why don't you go and
have a little fun?

05:19.141 --> 05:21.424
I won't stand in
your way.

05:38.111 --> 05:39.118
What have you done?

05:44.680 --> 05:47.605
WHERE IS YOUR MAGIC?

05:52.039 --> 05:53.609
I have to gain better control.

05:53.726 --> 05:55.192
I sure can't practice here.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.268
Twilight? Where are we going?

05:59.518 --> 06:01.227
Oh, uh, hi, Spike.

06:02.103 --> 06:03.943
Gotta go...somewhere else.

06:04.909 --> 06:06.522
Whoa!

06:09.192 --> 06:10.142
Whoa!

06:11.135 --> 06:11.828
Twilight?

06:20.487 --> 06:22.649
Oh my goodness. Are
you all right?

06:22.940 --> 06:24.671
Jumpin' june bugs,
Twilight.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.565
When did you learn
to fly that fast?

06:26.993 --> 06:30.485
I must've caught a particularly
strong breeze...

06:31.256 --> 06:32.054
or something.

06:32.573 --> 06:34.234
Must've been "or something"

06:34.341 --> 06:36.489
because there wasn't
any breeze up there.

06:36.823 --> 06:37.990
I don't know what happened.

06:38.343 --> 06:40.433
But I don't really have time
to figure it out right now.

06:42.081 --> 06:44.450
Another visit to the Castle of
the Two Sisters, I presume?

06:44.866 --> 06:46.848
We'd be more than
happy to accompany you.

06:47.038 --> 06:47.781
Not today.

06:48.581 --> 06:49.992
Tirek may still be a threat.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.801
I need you all to stay here
and encourage everypony

06:52.813 --> 06:53.998
to remain inside.

07:03.438 --> 07:06.593
Getting rid of your magic so
that I cannot take it from you?

07:07.008 --> 07:08.249
That was your plan?

07:10.099 --> 07:11.648
How does it feel?

07:12.089 --> 07:15.252
Knowing that soon
every Pegasus, Unicorn,

07:15.266 --> 07:17.863
and Earth Pony will
bow to my will

07:18.175 --> 07:21.159
and that there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.344
You will not prevail, Tirek.

07:23.806 --> 07:27.192
Give my regards to Cerberus.

07:31.843 --> 07:34.883
<i>You meant,our will,</i>
<i>didn't you?</i>

07:35.877 --> 07:37.133
Of course.

07:37.514 --> 07:39.840
Here. I want you to
have something.

07:40.175 --> 07:43.108
This was given to me by
someone very close to me.

07:43.340 --> 07:46.579
I give it to you as a sign
of my gratitude and loyalty.

07:46.983 --> 07:50.169
Oh my! I do love
a good accessory.

07:50.573 --> 07:52.651
I suppose that's
Rarity's influence.

07:55.116 --> 07:58.517
Amusing. But we have no
time for such things.

07:58.542 --> 08:00.694
With the Princesses out of
the way we can now--

08:02.515 --> 08:04.889
Is this meant to be humorous?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.042
Oh no!

08:06.056 --> 08:07.514
I haven't touched that one yet.

08:08.243 --> 08:09.145
There is a fourth?

08:09.457 --> 08:11.168
And you did not
tell me this?

08:11.336 --> 08:12.862
I just needed some assurance

08:13.053 --> 08:15.951
that you truly considered
this a team effort.

08:16.292 --> 08:18.042
And now I have it.

08:18.476 --> 08:21.539
Then where can we find
this fourth princess?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.047
Where is her castle?

08:23.198 --> 08:25.923
Castle? Oh. No.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.650
Princess Twilight lives
above a library in Ponyville.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.836
Castle. Ha ha!

08:33.315 --> 08:35.578
Not for much longer.

08:42.733 --> 08:43.527
<i>All right, y'all,</i>

08:43.830 --> 08:46.169
<i>I think we've warned</i>
<i>everypony to stay inside.</i>

08:46.489 --> 08:48.725
I'm sure Discord
will catch Tirek

08:48.827 --> 08:50.626
and this will all be over soon.

08:50.751 --> 08:53.756
I'll bet he takes
his sweet time.

08:53.896 --> 08:56.739
<i>Or perhaps these things</i>
<i>just take time.</i>

08:57.272 --> 08:58.171
You're back!

08:58.517 --> 09:00.199
Did you bring the
cucumber sandwiches?

09:00.290 --> 09:01.075
I did!

09:01.986 --> 09:05.826
I imagine they'll be your last
decent meal for quite some time.

09:11.178 --> 09:12.316
Ta-da!

09:12.476 --> 09:13.828
You've gathered up all of them?

09:14.068 --> 09:16.468
And her little dragon, too.

09:17.235 --> 09:19.006
Why are you doing this?

09:19.157 --> 09:20.864
I thought we were friends.

09:21.082 --> 09:22.323
Oh, we were.

09:22.401 --> 09:25.590
But Tirek offered me so much
more than just tea parties.

09:25.818 --> 09:27.332
Surely you saw this coming.

09:27.566 --> 09:30.481
I didn't. I really didn't.

09:45.619 --> 09:48.000
You really think she'd
do anything for them?

09:48.337 --> 09:52.171
If Twilight has magic to
give, it will be yours.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.654
Soon there won't be a Pegasus,
Earth Pony, or Unicorn

09:55.666 --> 09:59.227
who will be able to
stand up against us.

09:59.475 --> 10:03.533
Us? Who said
anything about us?

10:03.761 --> 10:04.386
You did.

10:05.531 --> 10:07.580
You've helped me grow strong.

10:07.799 --> 10:10.333
You've provided the means
by which I can obtain

10:10.390 --> 10:12.154
Princess Twilight's magic.

10:12.462 --> 10:15.252
And now you are no
longer of any use to me.

10:25.658 --> 10:29.939
But you said this was a sign
of your gratitude and loyalty.

10:30.232 --> 10:32.686
A gift from someone
close to you.

10:33.118 --> 10:35.322
My brother who betrayed me.

10:35.830 --> 10:38.200
It is as worthless as he is.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.840
Surely you saw this coming.

10:43.248 --> 10:46.398
I didn't. I truly didn't.

10:52.339 --> 10:53.525
I can do this.

10:58.403 --> 11:01.086
See? Ha! Perfectly
controlled teleportation!

11:07.841 --> 11:09.767
<i>PRINCESS TWILIGHT!</i>

11:09.841 --> 11:11.155
Tirek!

11:11.586 --> 11:14.497
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO ME!

11:28.267 --> 11:30.519
You're going to
give me what I want.

11:42.973 --> 11:44.064
No!

12:15.625 --> 12:19.164
Now I understand what your
fellow princesses have done.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.757
It appears we are
at an impasse.

13:35.176 --> 13:37.658
How about a trade,
Princess Twilight?

13:40.420 --> 13:44.074
Their release for all the
Alicorn magic in Equestria.

13:49.215 --> 13:52.349
What's it going to
be, Princess?

13:56.714 --> 13:58.204
Don't do it, Twilight!

13:58.438 --> 14:00.071
We aren't worth it.

14:00.302 --> 14:01.838
<i>Oh, but you are,</i>
<i>Fluttershy.</i>

14:02.403 --> 14:05.605
You're the pony who taught
me that Friendship is Magic.

14:05.783 --> 14:10.366
I had magic and friendship,
and now I don't have either.

14:10.786 --> 14:14.753
Enough! I want an answer.
And I want it now!

14:27.695 --> 14:31.933
I will give you my magic,
in exchange for my friends.

14:34.181 --> 14:36.005
As you wish.

14:43.610 --> 14:44.981
All of my friends.

14:45.574 --> 14:47.400
After the way he
has betrayed you,

14:47.412 --> 14:49.330
you still call him a "friend"?

14:50.534 --> 14:51.820
Release him!

14:52.325 --> 14:54.037
If that's what you want.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.527
Thank you, Twilight.

14:58.616 --> 14:59.418
I'm sorry.

14:59.966 --> 15:00.792
I know.

15:01.631 --> 15:03.320
Your turn.

15:28.433 --> 15:30.938
Twilight, what
were you thinking?

15:31.530 --> 15:33.873
Tirek tricked me into believing
that he could offer me something

15:33.886 --> 15:35.580
more valuable than friendship.

15:35.998 --> 15:39.459
But there is nothing worth
more. I see that now.

15:39.871 --> 15:42.663
He lied when he said that
this medallion was given

15:42.673 --> 15:45.038
as a sign of gratitude
and loyalty.

15:45.385 --> 15:48.961
But when I say that it is a
sign of our true friendship,

15:49.920 --> 15:52.138
I am telling the truth.

15:56.286 --> 15:58.202
You think that might
be the last one we need?

15:58.493 --> 15:59.921
We have to get to the chest.

16:22.530 --> 16:23.118
Together!

16:23.381 --> 16:25.291
I think we have to
do this together.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.517
How is this possible?
You have no magic!

17:20.753 --> 17:21.972
You're wrong, Tirek!

17:22.220 --> 17:24.351
I may have given you
my Alicorn magic,

17:24.520 --> 17:27.857
but I carry within me the
most powerful magic of all!

19:04.980 --> 19:09.892
Sweet Celestia! Are you all
seeing what I'm seeing?

19:10.292 --> 19:11.802
<i>But whose is it?</i>

19:12.179 --> 19:14.995
I believe it is yours,
Princess Twilight.

19:17.328 --> 19:20.852
You've been wondering what you
are meant to do as a Princess.

19:21.235 --> 19:22.509
Do you know now?

19:22.907 --> 19:26.130
As Princess, I believe I
have the power to spread

19:26.146 --> 19:28.470
<i>the Magic of Friendship</i>
<i>across Equestria.</i>

19:28.741 --> 19:30.835
<i>That is the role I am meant</i>
<i>to have in our world.</i>

19:31.297 --> 19:33.139
The role I choose to have.

19:33.771 --> 19:35.880
But I didn't defeat
Tirek on my own.

19:36.076 --> 19:38.081
It took all of us
to unlock the chest.

19:38.350 --> 19:39.880
Then it is unlikely
you are meant

19:39.894 --> 19:41.830
to take on this
task alone.

19:42.167 --> 19:43.986
Oooh! Wow!

19:44.060 --> 19:48.394
<i>You are now Twilight Sparkle,</i>
<i>the Princess of Friendship.</i>

19:53.067 --> 19:57.112
But what is the Princess of
Friendship without her friends?

20:06.534 --> 20:09.274
Wait a minute.
Where's my throne?

20:09.588 --> 20:11.896
I don't think you're
quite there yet.

20:12.066 --> 20:15.024
Yes, well, I suppose not.

20:16.819 --> 20:24.854
<i>♪ upbeat </i>

20:24.905 --> 20:27.672
