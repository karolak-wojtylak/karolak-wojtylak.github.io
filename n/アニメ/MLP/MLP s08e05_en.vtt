WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:07.106
I'm so glad I made it to Las
Pegasus before the fastest,

00:07.208 --> 00:10.742
most thrilling ride of
all time closes for good!

00:11.144 --> 00:14.613
Wait. The fastest, most
thrilling ride of all time?

00:16.017 --> 00:19.251
She hasn't heard of
"The Wild Blue Yonder"?

00:19.653 --> 00:22.421
[scoff] Of course, I have!

00:22.523 --> 00:24.523
It's that one where uh...

00:24.825 --> 00:26.959
All right, you got me.
What is it?

00:27.161 --> 00:30.196
Only the coolest
roller coaster ever!

00:30.298 --> 00:32.664
Pfft. You can't really call
yourself a Wonderbolt

00:32.766 --> 00:34.366
if you haven't
been on it.

00:40.107 --> 00:42.975
Oh, it looks incredible!

00:43.177 --> 00:44.643
Oh, it is.

00:44.745 --> 00:48.013
First, you strap yourself into
the cloud rocket car

00:48.115 --> 00:50.449
and then you're catapulted
straight through...

00:50.551 --> 00:54.220
a series of daring dips
and terrifying turns...

00:55.422 --> 00:57.056
flipping upside
down so many times,

00:57.158 --> 00:58.357
you don't know
which way is up...

01:01.896 --> 01:05.464
till finally, you climb to the
highest peak on the rails...

01:05.566 --> 01:07.833
then drop towards the
ground at lightning speed

01:07.935 --> 01:10.502
before coming up to
a screeching halt!

01:10.604 --> 01:13.005
It's the coolest
ride ever to exist

01:13.107 --> 01:15.808
in the history of Equestria!

01:16.210 --> 01:19.011
So.. when did you ride it?

01:19.413 --> 01:22.547
Oh. Heh heh. I haven't.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.926
The ride closes this week!
Forever!

02:07.128 --> 02:08.928
But I can't go to Las Pegasus

02:09.030 --> 02:11.763
because I have to teach
at Twilight's school.

02:11.965 --> 02:12.698
I'm going to miss out

02:12.800 --> 02:16.002
on the coolest roller
coaster of all time!

02:16.904 --> 02:18.704
Unless...

02:18.806 --> 02:22.041
Why do I feel like you're about
to ask me a mighty big favor?

02:22.143 --> 02:23.275
Can you cover my classes?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.078
Absolutely.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.046
Really? Awesome!

02:31.185 --> 02:32.718
On one condition.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.155
You tag along with a few other
ponies goin' to Las Pegasus.

02:39.361 --> 02:43.395
[laughter] Surely you don't
mean Granny Smith?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.064
No, no. Of course not!

02:45.166 --> 02:49.335
I mean Granny Smith and the rest
of the "Gold Horseshoe Gals!"

02:49.937 --> 02:52.137
Hurry yer haunches, Hinnies!

02:55.242 --> 02:56.942
Grand-Auntie Apple Sauce,

02:57.144 --> 02:58.510
Cousin Apple Rose,

02:58.612 --> 03:00.612
and Cousin Goldie Delicious!

03:01.715 --> 03:03.849
Why, I'm sure they'd be plum
tickled to have ya join

03:03.951 --> 03:06.685
their annual Grandmares'
trip to Las Pegasus.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.120
It'll be perfect!

03:08.222 --> 03:10.922
I'll teach your classes, and
you can look after them for me.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.092
[thwack] Look after them!?

03:13.194 --> 03:14.960
So they don't get
too carried away.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.162
Usually, Big Mac goes
along as a chaperone,

03:17.264 --> 03:18.964
but I'm sure he'd
love a break.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.871
There is NO way I'm going to
Las Pegasus with a bunch of

03:25.973 --> 03:28.173
old, slow grannies!

03:28.375 --> 03:30.942
So you don't mind
missing your only chance

03:31.044 --> 03:33.312
to ride The Wild Blue Yonder?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.849
Fine! I'll go.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.551
Hah! That's the spirit!

03:39.653 --> 03:41.553
Now skedaddle so I can
help 'em get ready.

03:41.755 --> 03:46.625
Granny: Applejack! Have you seen
my Cranky Flank cream?

03:46.727 --> 03:50.229
I can't find it in this
whole tootin' farmhouse!

03:50.531 --> 03:52.431
It's uh... gonna
take a while.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.073
Urghh.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.542
Why is this taking so long?

04:03.644 --> 04:05.077
The Wild Blue
Yonder's gonna close

04:05.179 --> 04:07.679
before we even get
to Las Pegasus!

04:08.581 --> 04:11.715
Here, I made a list to help
ya keep the grandmares

04:11.817 --> 04:12.784
out of trouble.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.219
Don't want to have to
bring 'em back home

04:14.321 --> 04:16.321
before you get to go
on yer roller coaster!

04:16.423 --> 04:17.889
That could happen!?

04:17.991 --> 04:20.425
Only if you don't
follow the rules!

04:20.527 --> 04:22.494
These grannies
need a lot of care.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.762
If one of 'em overdoes it,

04:23.864 --> 04:26.364
it's bye bye Las Pegasus
for the lot of ya.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.635
"Make sure they
get their naps...

04:29.837 --> 04:31.937
eat only soft foods...

04:32.139 --> 04:33.739
careful when dancing...

04:34.241 --> 04:35.907
don't get too excited"!?

04:36.009 --> 04:36.942
Seriously!?

04:37.144 --> 04:40.112
And don't let 'em out
of your sight. Ever.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.615
Wait. Then how am I supposed
to go on the roller coaster?

04:43.717 --> 04:46.685
You'll find time. And you might
even learn a thing or two

04:46.787 --> 04:49.154
about havin' a good time
from these old gals.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.193
Yeah, that'll happen.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.161
All right,
y'all.

04:56.263 --> 04:57.963
Time to get this
show on the road.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.432
Heh. Or in the sky,
in this case.

05:05.239 --> 05:06.238
Ugh!

05:06.940 --> 05:08.240
Come on, come on!

05:17.050 --> 05:18.750
Go go go go go!

05:33.734 --> 05:35.267
Agh!

05:35.569 --> 05:36.902
Everypony OK
in there?

05:37.104 --> 05:39.771
Dandy as a pansy
in a plant pot!

05:39.873 --> 05:44.576
You know, this hot air balloon
ride reminds me of the time

05:44.678 --> 05:46.145
I climbed a tree!

05:46.247 --> 05:48.547
Have I ever told you that story?

05:48.749 --> 05:51.216
Only about a million times!

05:51.318 --> 05:53.319
HUH? What did ya say?

05:54.221 --> 05:57.222
They said they've
heard the tree story!

05:57.524 --> 06:01.526
Oh, you want to
hear the tree story? OK!

06:01.628 --> 06:02.928
Here we go again..

06:03.030 --> 06:07.198
Back when I was a young filly,
I was afraid of tree-climbing!

06:07.300 --> 06:09.601
Knees knocking,
hooves sweating...

06:09.803 --> 06:11.670
Have you ever had
the hoof sweats?

06:11.772 --> 06:13.939
Well, they're just
the worst thing.

06:14.241 --> 06:17.209
You know, Cousin Strudel,
she used to get em too.

06:17.311 --> 06:20.078
Now, of course she was a
champion fritter thrower-

06:31.992 --> 06:36.028
The Wild Blue Yonder
is IN OUR HOTEL?

06:36.930 --> 06:40.665
Uh, I bet you grannies
are feeling super tired

06:40.767 --> 06:42.067
from your journey.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.235
Nope. How about a
trot down the avenue

06:44.337 --> 06:45.804
to see the
sights, girls?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.072
Oh, forget the sights!

06:47.174 --> 06:50.075
I came here to play some
serious horseshoe toss!

06:50.177 --> 06:53.011
Oh, can we see the rainbow
fountains at the water show?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.746
They're so magical.

06:54.848 --> 06:58.750
My pores are crying for a mud
mask at the Prism Palace spa!

07:00.788 --> 07:03.422
You know what would
be REALLY FUN?

07:03.724 --> 07:05.190
Relaxing in our room!

07:05.692 --> 07:08.226
C'mon! Last one to the
hotel is a rotten apple!

07:11.331 --> 07:12.632
Lemme get that for ya.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.008
Omigosh, omigosh,
omigosh, omigosh!

07:23.110 --> 07:24.309
There it is..

07:24.411 --> 07:26.811
The best rollercoaster ever!

07:28.683 --> 07:31.517
Oow! Warm up those withers, ladies!

07:31.619 --> 07:35.454
There's a horseshoe hurling
trophy with our names on it!

07:39.827 --> 07:43.262
[ghostly voice] Don't let
them get too excited.

07:43.464 --> 07:46.698
Or you'll have
to go home!

07:46.900 --> 07:49.401
[gasp] Whoa, whoa, whoa,

07:49.503 --> 07:52.037
That sounds a
little too exciting.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.173
Why don't we get you
checked in first?

07:57.911 --> 08:03.114
Oh, my, you are a strong
pony, aren't you, Sugar Hocks?

08:07.354 --> 08:08.219
Ugh.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.226
Welcome to our Gold
Horseshoe suite!

08:14.328 --> 08:18.030
Only the best of the best
for our favorite guests.

08:18.532 --> 08:21.667
Which of course means
you lovely mares.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.169
Why, thank ya a
bushel and a peck,

08:24.371 --> 08:27.439
you scrumptious morsel
o' frosted carrot cake!

08:28.141 --> 08:30.408
Oh, uh... Thank
you, ma'am.

08:33.981 --> 08:37.516
I think he was sweet on me.
Maybe I should ask him

08:37.618 --> 08:40.018
to accompany me to the
magic show tonight.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.153
Bah hah!

08:41.255 --> 08:43.655
Sure your name's
not Apple Saucy?

08:43.757 --> 08:45.424
Better find the brakes
on that buggy, sugar!

08:45.526 --> 08:46.576
We just got here!

08:46.777 --> 08:49.727
You're right. Better see what
else is out there first.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.631
The day is young and I am not!

08:55.936 --> 08:59.471
Uh. Granny Smith's right!
Let's not overdo it.

09:01.475 --> 09:05.878
How about a nice nap so you
can really enjoy Las Pegasus?

09:08.582 --> 09:09.915
Good idea!

09:10.017 --> 09:13.652
We could use some
shut-eye, hm?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.186
But I'm not tired....

09:15.488 --> 09:16.721
Oh! Right!

09:16.823 --> 09:18.323
Uh, yawn...

09:20.794 --> 09:25.430
You go along now and explore
while we rest, sugar booger.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.765
Yawn.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.733
If you say so!

09:31.572 --> 09:33.472
What? They'll be
in here sleeping

09:33.574 --> 09:34.806
the whole time
I'm gone.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.143
Quit judging me!

09:44.418 --> 09:47.352
[Ahem] One ticket for the
coolest roller coaster

09:47.454 --> 09:49.153
of all time, please.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.361
But... but... This
line never ends!

09:56.563 --> 09:57.462
I know, right?

09:57.564 --> 09:59.264
Good thing we can just
stand here all day

09:59.366 --> 10:01.967
without any responsibilities
waiting for us!

10:05.205 --> 10:06.771
Oh, hey, thanks!

10:07.173 --> 10:08.640
Enjoy the ride.

10:14.515 --> 10:17.682
Heh. They didn't
even know I left.

10:18.919 --> 10:19.651
Whoa!

10:21.655 --> 10:22.320
Meow?

10:22.522 --> 10:23.488
Gaaahh!

10:23.612 --> 10:25.357
♪♪

10:26.693 --> 10:28.126
They're gone!

10:33.233 --> 10:37.502
Granny Smith! Apple Rose!
Are you here?

10:38.004 --> 10:39.070
Apple Sauce?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.140
Goldie?

10:44.277 --> 10:47.579
[groan] I'm the worst chaperone ever.

10:47.781 --> 10:51.916
Don't let them out
of your siiiight!

10:52.018 --> 10:53.351
I know, I know!

10:55.689 --> 10:56.755
Excuse me, sir?

10:56.857 --> 10:59.090
Have you seen a group of
old mares around here?

10:59.392 --> 11:02.961
Lady, you just described half
the ponies in this place.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.466
Oh! This place is huge!

11:08.668 --> 11:10.268
They could be anywhere!

11:10.470 --> 11:15.840
[chanting]
Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie!

11:15.942 --> 11:16.908
Can they do it?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.310
Can good ole Goldie Delicious
and the Gold Horseshoe Gals

11:19.412 --> 11:21.012
break the all-time
resort record, folks?

11:25.719 --> 11:28.954
Now that's how you
hurl a horseshoe!

11:29.456 --> 11:33.058
Hah! No way! Goldie's
totally got game!

11:33.360 --> 11:35.994
Make some noise for the
best-played game of horseshoes

11:36.096 --> 11:37.996
this resort has ever seen!

11:38.098 --> 11:39.964
Can you believe
your eyes, folks?

11:44.271 --> 11:46.838
Yeah! Go Goldie!

11:47.140 --> 11:49.541
Stand back; she's
getting excited!

11:49.843 --> 11:50.575
Huh?

11:52.145 --> 11:52.978
Uh oh.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.715
Uh... Mind if I try?

11:59.286 --> 12:02.754
Whoops, guess I'm no
good at this game.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.022
Sorry.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.058
And the Gold
Horseshoe Gals are out!

12:07.160 --> 12:08.860
Looks like the show's
over, everypony.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.962
Awwwww!

12:13.266 --> 12:15.233
Oh, I'm so glad I found you.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.567
Everypony feeling OK?

12:16.669 --> 12:17.702
Not too excited?

12:17.904 --> 12:19.871
Pretty much the
opposite right now.

12:20.773 --> 12:21.407
Good.

12:21.509 --> 12:25.076
From now on, I'm not letting
you grannies out of my sight!

12:26.713 --> 12:30.815
In that case, let's paint
the town candy apple red!

12:30.917 --> 12:33.418
Oooh! We could
play more games!

12:33.520 --> 12:35.420
Or go shopping for hats!

12:35.522 --> 12:38.189
Have I ever told you about
the time I got a new hat

12:38.291 --> 12:41.793
and it turned out
to be a bird? Ha ha ha ha.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.696
THAT'S what we oughta do!

12:45.198 --> 12:46.231
REALLY?

12:48.835 --> 12:50.802
Hit the buffet!

12:51.004 --> 12:54.138
All that horseshoe tossin'
sure works up an appy-tite.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.340
[sigh] Uh huh.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.948
I love me some nachos!

13:04.050 --> 13:06.084
I'mma set my dentures
loose on these viddles

13:06.186 --> 13:07.885
until the crumbs cry uncle!

13:10.056 --> 13:13.358
They can only
eat soft fooods!

13:13.460 --> 13:17.728
You're a nacho away
from no rolleycoaster!

13:18.798 --> 13:19.897
[zoom] [chomp]

13:20.799 --> 13:22.166
Come on, Granny!

13:22.268 --> 13:23.702
You know you
can't have those.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.403
They're super crunchy!

13:28.909 --> 13:32.611
How about some nice,
soft carrot soup instead?

13:32.913 --> 13:35.380
I thought you was supposed
to be the fun one.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.982
Wait! I am fun!

13:38.284 --> 13:39.684
P.A. System: Attention
all thrill-seekers!

13:39.786 --> 13:42.954
There's only one day left to
ride the ride of all rides:

13:43.056 --> 13:45.590
the Wild Blue Yonder,
before it's gone for good!

13:45.692 --> 13:47.225
Get in line! Now!

13:50.730 --> 13:53.765
So, what does everypony
want to do tonight?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.734
I was thinking...

13:55.936 --> 13:58.870
go to our room and put
on eyemasks and earplugs?

14:01.174 --> 14:04.242
I'd rather hit the club and
show off my dance moves.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.778
I'm quite a legend when
it comes to rhumba.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.850
Sounds kind of intense.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.320
Aren't you all exhausted
from your big day?

14:15.522 --> 14:16.421
Heck no!

14:16.623 --> 14:19.590
We save up our energy all
year for Las Pegasus weekend!

14:19.692 --> 14:20.759
Isn't that right, girls?

14:21.161 --> 14:22.594
Mm hm!

14:22.896 --> 14:24.963
Ugh. Dancing it is, then.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.130
I'll be there...

14:36.943 --> 14:40.378
[haunting voice]
Careful when dancing!

14:40.580 --> 14:42.713
UGH! Stop doing that!

14:43.951 --> 14:46.985
Uh, that's probably
enough dancing for now!

14:47.187 --> 14:48.319
Right, Apple Rose?

14:48.421 --> 14:50.755
Oh, that was just my warm up!

14:55.929 --> 14:58.463
Look! It's our
favorite magicians...

14:58.565 --> 15:00.531
Big Bucks and Jackpot!

15:00.633 --> 15:03.768
And aren't they looking
handsome as ever!

15:10.844 --> 15:14.278
You little fillies have
got some smooth moves!

15:17.517 --> 15:21.552
Say, how would you Gold
Horseshoe Gals like to bring

15:21.654 --> 15:25.523
some of that good energy
into our magic show tonight?

15:25.825 --> 15:28.727
Here's five complimentary
VIP tickets

15:28.929 --> 15:33.765
to our most amazing trick, in
the Pony Fantastique Theater.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.133
Just over there.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.436
Sugarcube, we never
miss your show.

15:40.006 --> 15:40.872
Fabulous!

15:41.074 --> 15:42.540
We'll save a spot for you...

15:42.842 --> 15:44.208
on stage.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.177
And.. in our hearts.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.947
So gross.

15:51.183 --> 15:52.984
Yeee haw, girls!

15:53.086 --> 15:56.187
Apple Sauce landed us some Very
Important Pony tickets

15:56.289 --> 15:57.655
for the show tonight!

15:57.757 --> 15:59.357
Hee hee hee hee!

16:01.861 --> 16:03.895
Oh, come on!

16:03.997 --> 16:06.931
You said you were going back
to the room after dancing!

16:07.133 --> 16:10.101
So each pony could
have some alone time?

16:10.503 --> 16:13.037
Oh, now don't be a
stick in the mud.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.940
Trust me, you'll
love this show.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.309
It's the best thing
in Las Pegasus.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.377
Whoo hoo!

16:20.347 --> 16:23.481
Oh, hey, thanks for giving
me your place in line!

16:23.683 --> 16:26.184
They said I'm one of
the last ponies ever

16:26.286 --> 16:28.386
to ride the Wild
Blue Yonder!

16:41.568 --> 16:44.970
And now, for the trick
that made us famous.

16:45.372 --> 16:50.241
The most dangerous magical
feat known to ponykind.

16:55.782 --> 17:01.386
We'd like to invite some very
special mares to the stage.

17:02.088 --> 17:03.954
That's our cue, girls!

17:05.425 --> 17:06.991
Hey! Where are you going?

17:07.093 --> 17:08.192
Come back!

17:15.802 --> 17:18.503
Meet our lovely assistants.

17:21.975 --> 17:24.642
They will make a
Splashtastic Escape

17:24.744 --> 17:27.378
using only the instructions
we give them...

17:27.680 --> 17:29.180
with our minds!

17:29.782 --> 17:31.883
Don't try this at home, folks!

17:43.296 --> 17:44.963
Do I really have
to say anything?

17:46.332 --> 17:48.933
Release those
grannies right now!

17:56.309 --> 17:59.709
[sploosh]
[shouts from the audience]

18:01.381 --> 18:03.247
What'd ya go and do that for?

18:03.349 --> 18:05.450
That was our big star moment!

18:05.652 --> 18:06.951
You were in danger!

18:07.153 --> 18:08.286
I saw the water!

18:08.388 --> 18:09.453
You were trapped!

18:09.655 --> 18:10.821
Oh, pish tosh!

18:10.923 --> 18:12.757
This is a magic show.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.859
We've seen it a
thousand times.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.827
Everypony always escapes.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.899
That's right, folks!

18:21.101 --> 18:24.836
Because of our.. um... uh...
skill as magicians!

18:25.138 --> 18:27.305
And now, a disappearing act!

18:31.144 --> 18:33.177
Well, I hope you're happy.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.880
We've been waiting to be picked
as the lovely assistants

18:35.982 --> 18:38.449
in that trick for years!

18:38.751 --> 18:40.585
You keep ruining our fun!

18:40.787 --> 18:42.487
I had a hot hoof goin'
in that game

18:42.589 --> 18:43.922
you decided to lose for us!

18:44.024 --> 18:47.592
And I wanted to eat those
nachos at the buffet.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.594
And I could have torn
up the dance floor,

18:49.696 --> 18:51.863
if you didn't
keep stopping me.

18:52.165 --> 18:55.500
They're being too polite
to say it, so I will.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.202
Rainbow Dash, we
thought you'd be a hoot,

18:58.304 --> 19:00.404
but I ain't never
met a wetter hen!

19:00.706 --> 19:01.605
What?!

19:01.707 --> 19:02.507
She's right.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.076
You've had your mane in a
twist ever since we arrived.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.412
Is something the
matter, dear?

19:08.114 --> 19:10.615
I'm so sorry, everypony!

19:10.817 --> 19:13.618
The truth is, all I've wanted
to do for this whole trip is

19:13.720 --> 19:15.720
ride the Wild Blue Yonder!

19:15.822 --> 19:19.190
I mean, it's why I came to
Las Pegasus in the first place!

19:19.392 --> 19:22.226
Applejack told me not to
let you out of my sight,

19:22.528 --> 19:25.096
or you might overdo it and
we'd have to go home early.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.498
Applejack put
you up to this?

19:32.105 --> 19:34.072
Well, now it's too late.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.375
I ruined your trip and
it's the last day ever

19:37.477 --> 19:39.644
to ride the Wild
Blue Yonder.

19:39.946 --> 19:43.781
The line is so long,
I'll never get to go on it.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.153
Hey! What's so funny?

19:48.255 --> 19:50.889
[chuckle] Is that all you wanted?

19:51.391 --> 19:54.058
Well, fish-flavored
kitten-kibble.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.860
Why didn't you say so sooner?

19:57.397 --> 19:58.796
Come on, girls!

20:05.605 --> 20:08.072
We're "Gold Horseshoe" members!

20:08.174 --> 20:10.809
The most exclusive
club in Las Pegasus.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.544
And she's with us.

20:16.483 --> 20:19.350
We've been comin' here every
moon since we can remember.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.219
Even some we don't remember!

20:21.621 --> 20:24.289
It definitely has its perks.

20:25.091 --> 20:28.292
Like fancy suites and
roller coaster rides?

20:28.694 --> 20:29.860
That's right!

20:29.962 --> 20:32.163
And I hope you like
riding in the front.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.964
Um, YES!

20:35.702 --> 20:37.635
[giggle] This is amazing!

20:37.637 --> 20:38.770
Isn't this amazing?

20:38.872 --> 20:42.106
Sugar. You probably want
to hold on 'bout now.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.149
Whoo hoo!

20:56.756 --> 20:59.957
I'm sorry I misjudged you
for being older ponies.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.293
You mares are
actually pretty cool.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.627
Rainbow Dash?

21:03.729 --> 21:04.829
Yeah, Granny?

21:05.131 --> 21:07.865
The gals and I have
been talkin' and well...

21:08.167 --> 21:10.101
we think you're
a hoot after all.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.703
We'd like to invite you to
become a permanent member

21:12.805 --> 21:15.306
of the "Gold Horseshoe
Gals"! Hoo hoo!

21:18.244 --> 21:19.710
O-oh! Really!?

21:20.212 --> 21:21.579
Mm hm.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.581
Same time next year?

21:24.083 --> 21:26.717
I wouldn't miss it for anything.
