WEBVTT

00:04.638 --> 00:06.839
Thank you so much, Zecora!

00:06.941 --> 00:10.042
I never would have found the
crisscross moss without you!

00:10.444 --> 00:11.442
<i> Of course! </i>

00:11.544 --> 00:14.446
<i> I know where it grows</i>
<i> so it's not much to ask.</i>

00:14.548 --> 00:17.883
<i> Though retrieving it has</i>
<i> been a difficult task.</i>

00:17.985 --> 00:20.586
Oh, but the oxen visiting
Sweetfeather Sanctuary

00:20.688 --> 00:22.921
next week will surely
appreciate it!

00:23.023 --> 00:25.490
It really adds a
shine to their coat.

00:28.494 --> 00:32.231
<i> There we go. Now, that</i>
<i> wasn't so tough.</i>

00:32.433 --> 00:35.834
<i> Fluttershy tell me,</i>
<i> will this be enough?</i>

00:35.936 --> 00:39.172
Gee, I don't know, it's
a pretty big pack,

00:39.374 --> 00:41.873
so maybe enough to
fill up this sack?

00:42.075 --> 00:44.409
[gasp] [giggle] Oh, my!

00:44.511 --> 00:46.578
You're rubbing
off on me, Zecora!

00:49.317 --> 00:51.683
Oh! [shouts]

00:54.787 --> 00:56.355
Oh, no, oh no, oh no!

00:57.991 --> 00:59.891
Zecora! Are you all right?

01:00.093 --> 01:03.162
<i> No need to fret,</i>
<i> I only got wet...</i>

01:03.364 --> 01:05.530
<i> At least now I can easily grab</i>

01:05.632 --> 01:08.266
<i> all the crisscross moss</i>
<i> there is to be had!</i>

01:15.007 --> 01:18.310
[gasp]
What's happening to you?

01:18.712 --> 01:21.313
<i> Honestly, it's hard to tell,</i>

01:21.415 --> 01:25.016
<i> but suddenly I</i>
<i> don't feel so well.</i>

02:11.898 --> 02:13.465
All right, Zecora,

02:13.567 --> 02:16.068
let's have a listen to
the ol' ticker!

02:16.470 --> 02:17.036
<i> ♪ [jazz drumming] ♪</i>

02:17.037 --> 02:17.714
<i> ♪ [jazz drumming] ♪</i>
Hmmm...

02:17.715 --> 02:18.415
<i> ♪ [jazz drumming] ♪</i>

02:18.416 --> 02:19.227
<i> ♪ [jazz drumming] ♪</i>
Hmmm.

02:19.228 --> 02:19.750
<i> ♪ [jazz drumming] ♪</i>

02:20.874 --> 02:23.008
Do you think it's
serious, Doctor?

02:23.110 --> 02:25.611
Well, that wasn't a good sign.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.746
I can't believe a
<i> flower</i> did this!

02:28.048 --> 02:30.415
I take back thinking
it was pretty!

02:37.223 --> 02:40.326
We're looking for any
color other than red.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.528
Phew!

02:44.932 --> 02:47.933
Oh! It's just as I thought.

02:48.035 --> 02:53.638
I'm afraid you have a very rare
disease called ...Swamp Fever!

02:55.776 --> 02:58.377
<i> Tell me, Doctor,</i>
<i> what should I do?</i>

02:58.479 --> 03:01.180
<i> I've never heard of</i>
<i> Swamp Fever, mind you.</i>

03:01.282 --> 03:04.583
Unfortunately, very little is
known about the disease,

03:04.885 --> 03:07.085
except, of course, its symptoms:

03:07.187 --> 03:08.987
change of coat,
coughing bubbles,

03:09.089 --> 03:12.491
shock sneezing, confusion
and the last stage...

03:12.693 --> 03:15.260
The afflicted turn
into the very trees

03:15.362 --> 03:17.829
that drop the disease-
spreading flower.

03:18.431 --> 03:19.431
Oh!

03:19.533 --> 03:21.633
<i> Is there anything</i>
<i> that can be done?</i>

03:21.735 --> 03:23.569
<i> For such a terrible</i>
<i> conundrum?</i>

03:24.171 --> 03:27.072
A cure has yet to be discovered.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.874
I'm sorry, Zecora.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.175
Hmmm...

03:30.577 --> 03:32.278
It's a lot to take in..

03:32.980 --> 03:34.513
I'll leave you
two to discuss.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.817
Zecora, this is
all my fault!

03:39.019 --> 03:41.052
If you hadn't been helping
me get the crisscross moss,

03:41.154 --> 03:43.355
you wouldn't have
gotten Swamp Fever!

03:43.557 --> 03:45.824
I'm so sorry.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.493
<i> Fluttershy, you</i>
<i> are not to blame.</i>

03:48.595 --> 03:50.729
<i> These things happen,</i>
<i> all the same.</i>

03:50.931 --> 03:52.831
I refuse to accept that!

03:52.933 --> 03:55.400
There has to be<i> somepony</i>
who can help you.

03:56.702 --> 03:57.402
Oh!

03:57.504 --> 04:00.505
<i> There's a healer of legend</i>
<i> who never would fail.</i>

04:00.607 --> 04:03.542
<i> But I only know her</i>
<i> from ancient folk tales.</i>

04:03.744 --> 04:06.578
<i> Mystical and masked,</i>
<i> she came in the night</i>

04:06.680 --> 04:09.948
<i> and cured everything from</i>
<i> hoof cough to fur blight.</i>

04:10.050 --> 04:12.617
<i> What became of the</i>
<i> healer, nopony knows,</i>

04:12.719 --> 04:16.021
<i> for she disappeared</i>
<i> ages and ages ago.</i>

04:16.123 --> 04:18.557
The Mystical Mask, of course!

04:18.959 --> 04:21.893
My parents would tell me about
her whenever I was sick in bed.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.429
<i> There's so many accounts</i>
<i> of her power to heal</i>

04:24.531 --> 04:27.566
<i> She can't just be a legend.</i>
<i> I think she's real.</i>

04:27.768 --> 04:31.103
If that's who we need to cure
you, then I'm going to find her!

04:31.305 --> 04:33.571
And I know just the
pony who can help!

04:36.977 --> 04:37.909
[door opens] Twilight!

04:38.878 --> 04:40.178
[door opens] Twilight!

04:42.983 --> 04:45.183
Oh, I'm so sorry
to bother--

04:45.585 --> 04:47.919
are... are you cooking?

04:48.221 --> 04:50.389
Yeah, Spike and I are
having a cook-off.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.423
My cauliflower bites blew
her sweet potato muffins

04:52.525 --> 04:53.659
out of the water!

04:54.061 --> 04:55.527
I'm glad you're
here, Fluttershy,

04:55.629 --> 04:58.197
because we're going to need
a second opinion about that.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.202
Um... they're both
delicious. But ...

05:04.304 --> 05:05.637
Zecora has Swamp Fever
and there's no cure

05:05.739 --> 05:07.006
and it's all my fault
and the only pony

05:07.108 --> 05:08.207
who can cure her is
the Mystical Mask

05:08.309 --> 05:09.410
and I need your
help to find her!

05:09.534 --> 05:10.411
Twilight: Er...

05:11.112 --> 05:14.045
So what'd she pick? The
cauliflower bites, right?

05:23.556 --> 05:25.857
[sigh] That's the last book
on ancient ponies

05:26.059 --> 05:28.627
and still no mention of
the Mystical Mask.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.830
Hmm, did we check the
unabridged versions?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.698
Yes. And the books
on rare diseases,

05:33.800 --> 05:35.133
the books on rare plants

05:35.235 --> 05:37.569
and the entire section
on bog habitation.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.105
Well, we might have to look
through every book

05:40.207 --> 05:43.708
in the entire library, but I
know we'll figure it out!

05:44.110 --> 05:45.043
Oh...

05:54.286 --> 05:56.521
Oh, another dead end...

05:56.623 --> 05:58.323
Have you found
anything yet, Twilight?

05:58.425 --> 05:59.558
[snoring]
-Twilight?

05:59.660 --> 06:00.392
Ah! [crash]

06:00.594 --> 06:02.460
Goodness, are you OK?

06:02.962 --> 06:04.530
[sigh] I'm fine.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.666
Fluttershy, you know that
I want to help Zecora.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.669
But I think we'd be a lot better
off if we got some sleep.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.671
We've been at this for hours.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.573
Oh, I'm so sorry!

06:14.675 --> 06:16.708
I didn't realize how
late it had gotten!

06:17.510 --> 06:18.376
No problem.

06:18.478 --> 06:19.544
I'll grab you
a pillow and--

06:19.646 --> 06:22.180
Oh, no no no, I meant
<i> you</i> should sleep.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.750
I can't rest until
Zecora is healed!

06:25.552 --> 06:28.753
I understand how you feel, but I
still think we'd have more luck

06:28.855 --> 06:30.289
if we tried again
in the morning.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.991
Just promise me you'll
take a break soon.

06:33.293 --> 06:33.926
Mm-hmm.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.729
Good night, Fluttershy.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.768
[mumbling] 9 by 13 inch pan...

06:43.870 --> 06:44.603
Twilight!

06:45.105 --> 06:46.705
Non-stick pans!

06:47.007 --> 06:50.141
[sigh] What's all the commotion
in here, ladies?

06:50.343 --> 06:53.344
Sorry! But I figured out
who the Mystical Mask is.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.313
[gasp] You did?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.848
All I had to do was
cross-reference

06:56.950 --> 06:58.416
a book about masks
with another book

06:58.518 --> 06:59.884
on ancient
Equestrian healers,

06:59.986 --> 07:01.620
then use a third book
to translate it all

07:01.722 --> 07:03.354
from Old Ponish
and there it was!

07:03.456 --> 07:04.623
Zecora was right!

07:04.725 --> 07:07.125
The Mystical Mask
wasn't just a legend.

07:07.227 --> 07:10.094
The Mystical Mask
was MAGE MEADOWBROOK!

07:11.998 --> 07:14.365
The ancient sorceress
from Hayseed Swamp?

07:14.467 --> 07:16.567
We studied her at
Celestia's school.

07:16.669 --> 07:17.836
Are you sure!?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.204
Absolutely!

07:19.306 --> 07:21.339
Mage Meadowbrook wasn't
just a sorceress,

07:21.441 --> 07:23.107
she was also a
healer and back then,

07:23.209 --> 07:25.811
healers wore masks so they
wouldn't get sick themselves!

07:26.013 --> 07:29.080
Fluttershy, I am so
incredibly proud of you

07:29.182 --> 07:31.917
for using your research
skills to figure this out!

07:32.319 --> 07:34.285
But... Meadowbrook
lived ages ago and...

07:34.487 --> 07:35.987
Didn't she disappear?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.056
Mm hm. But if we go
to Hayseed Swamp,

07:38.158 --> 07:39.891
maybe we can find
something she left behind.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.826
Something that could
lead to a cure!

07:41.928 --> 07:45.396
It seems like a long shot,
but I guess it's possible.

07:47.232 --> 07:49.500
We have to try! I've got
our route all planned out

07:49.602 --> 07:51.236
and on the way we can
check up on Zecora and--

07:51.538 --> 07:54.239
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're leaving<i> now?</i>

07:54.341 --> 07:55.040
Of course!

07:55.142 --> 07:56.508
Every second we spend waiting,

07:56.610 --> 07:59.044
is a second Zecora
is coughing bubbles!

07:59.146 --> 08:01.045
But Fluttershy,
you haven't slept.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.647
And that's a long journey.

08:02.749 --> 08:05.383
There's no use trying to talk
me out of this, Twilight!

08:05.985 --> 08:07.752
We've got no
time to waste!

08:07.854 --> 08:10.188
Can we at least
grab some breakfast!?

08:11.357 --> 08:12.857
I packed cauliflower bites.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.493
Aww. No sweet
potato muffins?

08:15.695 --> 08:17.729
I.. uh.. ate them all.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.364
They were actually
really good.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.739
...and that's when I
realized the Mystical Mask

08:27.841 --> 08:29.942
was actually Mage
Meadowbrook!

08:30.144 --> 08:32.978
[cough]
<i> That's marvelous, Fluttershy!</i>

08:33.080 --> 08:34.779
<i> I am quite impressed.</i>

08:34.881 --> 08:36.415
<i> While you're gone</i>
<i> on your journey</i>

08:36.517 --> 08:39.117
<i>I'll try not to be</i> ...<i> worried.</i>

08:39.419 --> 08:43.188
[gasp] Oh, no! Zecora,
you didn't rhyme!

08:43.290 --> 08:44.890
You must be getting worse!

08:45.092 --> 08:47.992
<i> Oh! No, no, no! Not at all...</i>

08:48.094 --> 08:50.795
<i> Something, something... ball?</i>

08:51.197 --> 08:52.230
Achoo!

08:53.766 --> 08:55.033
Ah! That's it!

08:55.135 --> 08:56.334
We have to go now!

08:56.436 --> 08:57.936
Lead the way, Fluttershy!

09:19.593 --> 09:22.961
So... where do you think
Meadowbrook lived?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.397
[yawn] I'm not sure.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.866
Maybe there's
somepony we can ask.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.969
I think we might be
the only ponies here.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.408
Wait! I recognize that tree!

09:40.413 --> 09:42.581
Oh! Yes, this has to be it!

09:42.683 --> 09:44.983
It's just like the
illustrations of her home!

09:45.385 --> 09:48.386
Anypony who lives in
a tree is OK by me.

09:52.859 --> 09:53.892
Phew!

09:53.994 --> 09:56.094
Well, if the doorway
is sealed up,

09:56.196 --> 09:57.963
we just have
to dig our way in.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.699
Back up, Twilight; I don't
want you to get hurt!

10:03.103 --> 10:05.269
Or we could try
the handle.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.808
It really blends
in with the bark.

10:11.010 --> 10:11.976
Easy to miss.

10:14.346 --> 10:18.349
Wow, it looks like this place
has been abandoned for years.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.654
[gasp] Twilight! Look!

10:22.756 --> 10:26.058
It's the same kind of lily pad
that gave Zecora Swamp Fever!

10:26.460 --> 10:29.494
Hmm. I wonder if Meadowbrook
was looking for a cure

10:29.596 --> 10:30.996
for Swamp Fever too.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.031
[gasp] Do you think she found it?

10:33.433 --> 10:36.067
I hope so. But let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

10:37.538 --> 10:39.538
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.807
You're making your excited
squeaking noise.

10:42.209 --> 10:46.311
Uh, I wasn't making my
excited squeaking noise.

10:48.448 --> 10:52.517
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!

10:52.619 --> 10:54.619
Y'all can stop screaming now.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.254
Didn't mean to scare ya.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.789
I do that a lot.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.157
Scare ponies?

10:59.259 --> 11:00.992
Or rock creepily in the dark?

11:01.294 --> 11:03.762
Well.. both, I s'pose.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.463
Name's Cattail.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.765
Pleased to meet ya!

11:07.167 --> 11:09.968
Likewise, but um, may I ask,

11:10.070 --> 11:12.170
why are you in Mage
Meadowbrook's home?

11:12.372 --> 11:14.506
Oh, I take care of the place.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.541
I ain't much of a cleaner but..

11:16.643 --> 11:19.044
from what I hear,
my kin wasn't either,

11:19.146 --> 11:22.981
so I doubt they'd mind a few
cobwebs in our ancestral home.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.184
[gasp] You're related to
Mage Meadowbrook?

11:26.486 --> 11:27.252
Mm hm.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.320
Oh, my goodness,
Twilight, we did it!

11:29.522 --> 11:32.090
Not only did we find Mage
Meadowbrook's old house,

11:32.192 --> 11:34.726
we actually found one
of her descendants!

11:34.828 --> 11:37.195
Honestly, I would
not have guessed it.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.031
So, you lookin' for
some kind of cure, huh?

11:40.133 --> 11:42.801
Well, now, I know
Meadowbrook was known

11:42.903 --> 11:45.003
to always be writing
in her journals.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.373
If she had the cure you want,
I reckon that's where it'd be.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.109
Come on! I'll show
ya the library.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.978
Library? Now
we're talking!

11:57.850 --> 12:01.953
Oh. Well, libraries come
in all shapes and sizes.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.421
This is good!

12:03.523 --> 12:05.856
It'll take us less time
to go through everything.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.565
<i>"Today my mom made me eat peas.</i>
<i> Peas are yucky."</i>

12:13.967 --> 12:15.867
And... we can probably
skip this one.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.869
Unless she found a cure
when she was a foal...

12:17.971 --> 12:19.371
<i> "I met a colt today.</i>

12:19.573 --> 12:22.607
<i> He pulled my mane so I</i>
<i> put a frog on his head."</i>

12:22.709 --> 12:23.942
Also not helpful.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.210
But I do kind of want to
see where it goes.

12:26.834 --> 12:27.334
Huh.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.016
Wait, listen to this!

12:31.218 --> 12:34.619
<i>"Today, I tried again to</i>
<i>brew an un-sniffle elixir...</i>

12:36.422 --> 12:38.991
<i> " ... and I finally</i>
<i> got it right!</i>

12:40.193 --> 12:41.660
Achoo!

12:49.301 --> 12:52.036
Meadowbrook, I think
it's time you had this.

12:54.273 --> 12:57.041
[gasp] My very own
healer's mask!

12:57.143 --> 12:58.676
You think I'm
ready, Mother?

12:58.878 --> 12:59.978
Mm hm.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.484
[gasp] What caused this?

13:08.654 --> 13:11.022
<i> Mother calls it "Swamp Fever".</i>

13:11.124 --> 13:15.160
<i> We've been trying to find a</i>
<i> cure, but it hasn't been easy.</i>

13:21.334 --> 13:23.534
<i> The fever's spread</i>
<i> like wild fire.</i>

13:28.108 --> 13:30.942
<i> I fear if we don't</i>
<i> find the cure soon,</i>

13:31.044 --> 13:34.479
<i> everypony will be</i>
<i> in grave danger...</i>

13:37.884 --> 13:41.986
<i> With mother sick, I didn't</i>
<i> think I'd ever find a cure,</i>

13:42.088 --> 13:45.123
<i> but staring at those</i>
<i> cursed flowers today.</i>

13:45.225 --> 13:47.092
<i> I saw something...</i>

13:54.767 --> 13:56.434
[gasp] Flash Bees!

13:58.804 --> 14:02.874
<i> I realized the flower's poison</i>
<i> didn't affect the Flash Bees</i>

14:02.976 --> 14:06.110
<i> and if they were</i>
<i> immune to Swamp Fever,</i>

14:06.212 --> 14:08.446
<i> their honey could be the cure!</i>

14:31.270 --> 14:34.873
<i> But they were so aggressive</i>
<i> defending their hive,</i>

14:34.975 --> 14:37.342
<i> I didn't know how I</i>
<i> was going to get it!</i>

14:41.046 --> 14:43.247
Here goes nothin'!

14:48.487 --> 14:52.958
<i> Today I cured Mother and</i>
<i> the rest of the bayou.</i>

14:53.360 --> 14:56.194
<i> It was the greatest feeling</i>
<i> I've ever experienced</i>

14:56.296 --> 14:58.062
<i> and I promise to</i>
<i> dedicate my life</i>

14:58.164 --> 15:00.865
<i> to curing ponies all</i>
<i> over Equestria.</i>

15:01.067 --> 15:03.201
Cattail: And she did just that.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.471
Right up till she
disappeared without a trace.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.507
So all we have to do is find
those aggressive Flash Bees

15:09.709 --> 15:11.409
and get them to give
us their honey!

15:12.812 --> 15:15.280
Of course, it doesn't
say how she did that.

15:18.517 --> 15:20.385
What? Is my mane messy?

15:20.487 --> 15:22.387
I know I haven't slept
in a while but...

15:24.823 --> 15:29.727
[gasp] Oh, no! I've caught
Swamp Fever!

15:35.602 --> 15:36.534
Huh?

15:41.874 --> 15:43.774
Are you sure these
are necessary?

15:43.976 --> 15:44.609
What?

15:44.811 --> 15:47.812
I said, are you sure
these are necessary?

15:48.014 --> 15:51.749
YES! I won't risk
infecting you or Cattail.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.152
What you can't risk
is getting any sicker.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.921
If you don't rest, your
symptoms will only get worse.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.925
Mm-hm. You really should rest
up before going up

16:01.027 --> 16:02.961
against those
Flash Bees.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.063
They are nasty critters.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.265
Um, you don't know
this about me,

16:07.367 --> 16:09.734
but I'm pretty
good with animals.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.836
And besides, Dogtail...

16:12.038 --> 16:13.104
Cattail.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.907
Um, Zecora is counting on me.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.743
I have to help her just like
Meadowbrook helped her mother

16:18.945 --> 16:21.245
and all those bayou
ponies long ago.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.414
But Fluttershy, as
much as Meadowbrook

16:23.516 --> 16:25.083
took care of other ponies,

16:25.185 --> 16:27.385
I'm sure she also
took care of herself!

16:27.487 --> 16:30.189
You're not going to
change my mind, Twilight!

16:30.491 --> 16:34.224
Ooh. For being sick, she
sure is strong.

16:36.562 --> 16:39.365
Cattail: The Flash Bee
hive is just up yonder.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.867
Are you sure you don't
want me to come with you?

16:42.969 --> 16:45.403
No, it's too
dangerous, Twilight.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.372
Besides, I've already
gotten one friend hurt.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.408
I won't let it
happen to another.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.512
Phew. OK, Fluttershy.
You can do this!

17:02.288 --> 17:03.588
Mind over matter!

17:20.807 --> 17:22.540
Hello, Flash Bees!

17:22.742 --> 17:25.042
I was hoping I could
get some of your honey.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.614
Oh, I see.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.149
You don't let others have any.

17:31.251 --> 17:34.252
Well, I'm sorry, but
I<i> really</i> need it.

17:35.689 --> 17:38.156
Huh. I didn't want it to
have to come to this

17:38.358 --> 17:39.891
but I'll just have to use...

17:40.393 --> 17:42.093
The Stare.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.437
You really are
aggressive.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.146
Oh, dear.

18:07.019 --> 18:10.989
Ooh. What happened? Where am I?

18:11.191 --> 18:13.624
Oh. I'm so glad you're OK!

18:13.826 --> 18:15.460
You're still in
Meadowbrook's tree.

18:15.562 --> 18:19.497
You fainted but Twilight shot
some magic up and caught ya.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.132
It was crazy.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.933
Goodness gracious!

18:24.904 --> 18:26.170
Have you heard from Zecora?

18:26.372 --> 18:27.405
Is she OK?

18:27.907 --> 18:28.640
Uh...

18:28.742 --> 18:32.744
We got word your zebra friend
has started sprouting leaves.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.580
She's already
turning into a tree?

18:35.882 --> 18:37.582
I thought we'd
have more time.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.351
Actually, you've been
asleep for three days.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.519
Three days!?

18:43.021 --> 18:43.721
Mm hm.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.090
You were asleep so long, we were
afraid you wouldn't be able

18:46.192 --> 18:47.458
to move when you woke up,

18:47.660 --> 18:49.927
but thankfully you just
wore yourself down.

18:50.229 --> 18:50.995
Oh, dear.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.563
We have to get
back to the hive.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.198
I've wasted so much time-

18:54.300 --> 18:56.534
Now hang on there,
Fluttershy,

18:56.636 --> 18:58.803
those Flash Bee
critters are tricky.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.070
Cattail's right.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.440
I can't even use magic
to calm them down.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.475
We'll have to find another
way to get the honey.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.345
We've tried everything
from disguises

19:07.547 --> 19:10.080
to things I won't
even speak of.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.918
He's been through a lot
these past three days.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.152
Wait...

19:15.254 --> 19:17.187
disguises...

19:25.263 --> 19:27.064
[gasp] That's it!

19:27.166 --> 19:28.366
I know how she did it!

19:28.468 --> 19:30.467
I know how Meadowbrook
got the honey!

19:34.406 --> 19:37.909
<i> This</i> is how Meadowbrook got
the honey from the Flash Bees.

19:38.111 --> 19:40.078
She threw a mask at 'em?

19:40.180 --> 19:42.180
I wouldn't recommend that.

19:42.282 --> 19:45.683
No. The male bees aren't
aggressive around the queen bee

19:45.785 --> 19:48.753
and this mask has the same
stripes that she does!

19:49.055 --> 19:50.688
Fluttershy, that's brilliant!

19:51.757 --> 19:53.123
A-A-Achoo!

19:53.225 --> 19:54.425
Whoa!

19:54.927 --> 19:56.460
There's no time to waste!

19:56.662 --> 19:57.828
Hooves crossed!

20:00.132 --> 20:02.833
Oh, golly, I can't watch!

20:05.505 --> 20:06.737
Mind over matter!

20:25.023 --> 20:25.990
Twilight!

20:26.692 --> 20:28.258
It's working!

20:37.803 --> 20:40.505
I think she's cured
now, Fluttershy.

20:40.607 --> 20:45.810
<i> Oh, I do feel fine,
<i> and this honey is divine</i>.</i>

20:46.512 --> 20:48.679
Oh, you're
rhyming again!

20:48.781 --> 20:51.015
Welcome back,
my friend!

20:51.117 --> 20:53.918
<i> Thank you Fluttershy,</i>
<i> for all you endured.</i>

20:54.020 --> 20:56.988
<i> If not for you, I</i>
<i> would not be cured.</i>

20:57.390 --> 20:59.457
Oh.. If it wasn't for me,

20:59.559 --> 21:02.193
you wouldn't have been
sick in the first place!

21:02.695 --> 21:05.095
<i> Regret is not what</i>
<i> you should feel,</i>

21:05.197 --> 21:08.599
<i> because on this journey,</i>
<i> you've learned a great deal.</i>

21:08.701 --> 21:10.001
That's true.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.770
I certainly learned that if you
don't take care of yourself,

21:12.972 --> 21:15.539
you won't be able to take
care of anypony else.

21:15.641 --> 21:19.810
In fact, if I had rested, like
Twilight suggested all along,

21:20.012 --> 21:23.413
maybe I would have thought to
use Meadowbrook's mask sooner.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.118
Please tell me you
found the cure.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.088
A-Achoo!

21:30.812 --> 21:32.212
Achoo!
