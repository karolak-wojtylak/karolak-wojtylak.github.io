WEBVTT

00:03.204 --> 00:05.070
Order, order everypony!

00:05.172 --> 00:06.738
I hereby call to
order this meeting

00:06.840 --> 00:08.840
of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club!

00:12.613 --> 00:13.745
First order of business:

00:13.847 --> 00:15.481
Let's celebrate the one
and only Rainbow Dash!

00:15.583 --> 00:16.949
Yay! She's amazing. Now
if there's nothing else,

00:17.051 --> 00:18.718
that concludes this meeting of
the Rainbow Dash Fan Club.

00:18.820 --> 00:19.986
Thank you all for coming.
Any questions?

00:23.257 --> 00:24.023
Huh?

00:24.825 --> 00:25.857
Meeting adjourned!

00:32.199 --> 00:34.465
I'd like to call to order
the first ever meeting

00:34.568 --> 00:36.802
of the newest and
most exciting club...

00:36.904 --> 00:39.972
of which I am the president,
founding, and only member...

00:40.174 --> 00:41.974
The Washouts Fan Club!

01:23.250 --> 01:27.018
Oh, hey Scootaloo, I was
just in the neighbor--

01:27.120 --> 01:28.487
Oh, what's this?

01:29.757 --> 01:32.090
Did I interrupt your
fan club meeting?

01:32.292 --> 01:34.960
Hey! What are
you doing here?

01:35.162 --> 01:37.296
I could ask you
the same question!

01:37.898 --> 01:41.267
Oh uh, you know... stuff.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.269
Definitely not starting a
new fan club or anything...

01:44.571 --> 01:46.338
HA! It's no use
pretending.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.840
I heard everything
when I was outside eavesdropping

01:48.942 --> 01:50.776
like I do for
every meeting!

01:50.978 --> 01:52.544
You eavesdrop on
every meeting?

01:52.646 --> 01:54.079
That's... weird.

01:54.681 --> 01:57.816
Well, sure it sounds weird
when you say it out loud.

01:57.918 --> 02:00.285
And I probably shouldn't because
eavesdropping is wrong,

02:00.387 --> 02:01.286
but still...

02:01.388 --> 02:03.689
Why are you starting
a new fan club?

02:04.091 --> 02:07.392
I just think maybe it's
time for me to explore...

02:07.494 --> 02:08.994
other fan clubs.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.502
What is a "The Washouts?"

02:17.604 --> 02:21.473
Only the newest and greatest and
ONLY stunt troupe in Equestria!

02:21.675 --> 02:22.841
Stunt troupe?

02:23.043 --> 02:25.076
How can I explain it?
Like the Wonderbolts,

02:25.178 --> 02:28.847
just TWENTY BAJILLION
PERCENT COOLER.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.049
Twenty bajillion!?

02:31.151 --> 02:34.119
They do all sorts of extreme
stunts that focus on daredevilry

02:34.221 --> 02:36.254
and sheer guts, rather
than boring old

02:36.356 --> 02:38.123
flight-and-formation junk.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.560
Boring old flight
and formation junk!?

02:41.762 --> 02:43.662
Are you just repeating
everything I say?

02:43.864 --> 02:45.497
Only because my brain
feels like it's strapped

02:45.599 --> 02:47.432
to one of those rockets
about to explode.

02:47.634 --> 02:48.634
So you do
get it!

02:49.036 --> 02:50.902
Aren't they awesome?

02:54.241 --> 02:56.942
Can you believe she
actually said that?

02:57.244 --> 03:01.446
Pfft. Well, yeah, eavesdropping on
every meeting is kinda weird.

03:01.748 --> 03:05.784
I mean she basically said that
the Wonderbolts aren't cool!

03:05.886 --> 03:09.288
And.. and it kinda sounded like she
didn't think I was cool either.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.824
But pah! We all
know that's crazy.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.926
I mean, I'm definitely
not worried

03:15.028 --> 03:17.362
about her looking up
to somepony else.

03:17.464 --> 03:18.563
Heh. Nope.

03:18.665 --> 03:19.364
Not.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.132
At.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.200
ALL.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.435
Well, I'd understand
if you were.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.104
It'd be like if Apple Bloom
started lovin' bananas

03:26.206 --> 03:27.172
more than apples!

03:27.274 --> 03:28.874
Hahaha!

03:29.176 --> 03:30.909
Y'all tell me if that
ever happens, you hear?

03:31.211 --> 03:35.046
But what could the Washouts
possibly have that I don't?

03:35.148 --> 03:36.381
Why don't you find out?

03:37.985 --> 03:41.419
They're doing a show in
Ponyville this weekend!?

03:43.724 --> 03:48.827
Wow... they do look pretty
amazing...ly unamazing. Heh.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.930
Trying so hard to look
amazing, is what I mean.

03:52.532 --> 03:55.099
NICE SAVE, TWILIGHT!

04:04.144 --> 04:07.545
[groan] I knew we should have
lined up last night.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.120
I'm sorry for making us late.
Who would have guessed

04:15.222 --> 04:17.956
X-TREME CHOCOLATE AIR SHOW
CUPCAKES would take an...

04:18.058 --> 04:20.558
x-tremely long time to bake?

04:25.332 --> 04:28.967
Look at this! It's a
total Wonderbolts rip-off!

04:29.269 --> 04:31.836
What do you mean? The show
hasn't even started yet!

04:31.938 --> 04:33.972
Yeah, but look at what
we're sitting on.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.441
<i>Hello!</i>

04:36.543 --> 04:38.877
The Wonderbolts
have bleachers too.

04:39.020 --> 04:41.988
We practically invented
sitting on bleachers.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.048
Ugh!

04:43.150 --> 04:48.453
And look at that! Popcorn
and cotton candy? RIP-OFF!

04:50.791 --> 04:52.991
Huh!? Yeah!

04:53.093 --> 04:54.959
[aggressive announcer]
<i> This is the time.</i>

04:55.061 --> 04:56.995
<i> This is the place.</i>

04:57.197 --> 04:59.364
<i> This is the team...</i>

04:59.766 --> 05:04.102
<i> THIS IS... THE WASHOUTS!</i>

05:07.875 --> 05:10.075
Eh. Quality confetti
cannon work!

05:10.877 --> 05:11.843
Agh!

05:16.983 --> 05:18.416
Oh, yeah!

05:21.688 --> 05:26.291
<i> Say it with me now, the</i>
<i> Washout's official motto...</i>

05:26.493 --> 05:29.828
"LEAP BEFORE YOU LOOK!"

05:32.432 --> 05:33.131
Lame.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.540
<i> Remember ponies, while</i>
<i> they're amazingly awesome,</i>

05:41.642 --> 05:44.009
<i> The Washouts are highly</i>
<i> trained professionals</i>

05:44.111 --> 05:47.312
<i> with protective</i>
<i> fireproof flight suits!</i>

05:47.414 --> 05:49.781
<i> Do not try this at home!</i>

06:01.027 --> 06:01.693
Whoa.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.231
Come on! Come on!

06:09.135 --> 06:10.469
She's not gonna make it!

06:12.505 --> 06:13.638
[collective gasp]

06:19.880 --> 06:22.580
THAT. WAS. INSANE!

06:22.682 --> 06:24.749
WHOO HOO!

06:24.851 --> 06:26.218
I told you!

06:26.520 --> 06:29.455
I mean... [ahem] it
was pretty cool.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.724
Who are these guys..?

06:38.865 --> 06:41.566
I can't just go up
and TALK to them!

06:41.668 --> 06:43.301
You can if you're with me.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.671
After all, one of the reasons
there's a Rainbow Dash fan club

06:46.773 --> 06:49.741
is because I'm
fearless. Observe.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.680
Hey!

06:58.751 --> 07:00.351
Uh... so...

07:00.453 --> 07:02.353
as a fellow aerobatic
professional,

07:02.455 --> 07:04.689
I really enjoyed
your show.

07:04.891 --> 07:08.026
Heh, actually, you might
recognize me since I'm a...

07:08.228 --> 07:09.962
"pause for dramatic effect..."

07:11.064 --> 07:12.864
A Wonderbolt.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.935
Join the club!

07:18.571 --> 07:20.839
OK....?

07:22.141 --> 07:24.476
No, I mean literally join
the club. We're called

07:24.578 --> 07:26.778
"The Washouts" because we
all used to be Wonderbolts

07:26.880 --> 07:29.948
just like you... until
we "washed out."

07:30.450 --> 07:31.950
No way!

07:32.352 --> 07:33.384
Yep. Ah.

07:33.486 --> 07:34.719
Name's Rolling Thunder.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.088
I got booted out of
Wonderbolt Academy cause of

07:37.190 --> 07:40.058
"flagrant disregard for
hazardous weather." Psh.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.360
If doin' barrel rolls through
nine-hundred million volts

07:42.462 --> 07:44.729
of electricity in a raging
thunderstorm is wrong,

07:44.931 --> 07:46.598
then I don't want to be right.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.968
Cool!

07:49.270 --> 07:51.403
Heh. This here's Short Fuse...

07:51.705 --> 07:52.737
Ah. Nice to meet you.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.005
What's your story?

07:54.507 --> 07:55.540
ANGER ISSUES!

07:55.642 --> 07:57.442
GET OFF MY BACK!

07:58.144 --> 08:00.612
Uh, OK.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.348
So... who's the leader?

08:03.750 --> 08:08.086
Only the most reckless
ex-Wonderbolt of all time...

08:08.188 --> 08:15.890
♪♪

08:16.063 --> 08:18.329
[gasp] Lightning Dust!

08:18.631 --> 08:20.398
Rainbow Dash.

08:21.568 --> 08:24.603
Scootaloo. I'm
Scootaloo. Hi.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.543
Lightning Dust...

08:31.645 --> 08:33.645
I should have known you
were the brains behind

08:33.747 --> 08:36.081
a crazy idea like
the Washouts.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.950
Or should I say
"lack of brains."

08:40.020 --> 08:42.053
You two really know each other?

08:42.155 --> 08:46.692
OH MY GOSH THIS IS SO COOL!

08:46.894 --> 08:49.694
Your friend got me kicked
out of the Wonderbolts.

08:50.096 --> 08:53.232
Oh. That's, uh... less cool.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.936
And it was the best thing
that ever happened to me!

08:57.638 --> 08:59.404
Great to see you,
"Wing Pony!"

08:59.506 --> 09:01.673
I heard you're a
full-fledged Bolt now!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.642
Yeah, well,
I'm still--

09:03.744 --> 09:04.543
Mad at me?

09:04.945 --> 09:06.745
Look, was it wrong
of me to endanger

09:06.847 --> 09:08.747
the lives of your
friends? Yeah.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.983
But hey, now I only
endanger these knuckleheads!

09:13.687 --> 09:15.454
Don't call me <i>knucklehead</i>.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.826
Come on, you know you miss me.

09:20.928 --> 09:24.329
Me and her? We blew
everypony out of the sky.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.964
Really!?

09:26.166 --> 09:30.802
Actually yeah, really. All that
wind was totally dangerous.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.203
But we had fun, right?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.673
Two fastest times
on the Dizzitron.

09:34.775 --> 09:38.410
If I remember correctly, I had
you beat by half a second.

09:38.612 --> 09:42.714
Only because when I went, I
cranked up the dizziness factor!

09:44.585 --> 09:46.417
Well, I'm glad it
all worked out.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.587
Your show was
pretty dynamite.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.155
Wanna know the secret?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.924
We basically ignore
everything the Wonderbolts

09:53.026 --> 09:54.826
ever taught us about safety.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.230
Well, we do have safety
rules for a reason.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.783
Don't listen to
her, kid.

10:00.884 --> 10:03.935
All their "rules" were just ways
of keeping their little club

10:04.037 --> 10:06.838
exclusive so they could
feel good about themselves.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.907
It's not about making
anypony feel bad,

10:09.009 --> 10:11.109
it's about finding
the best flyers.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.678
The best of the best.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.948
I started the Washouts
because I believe anypony

10:17.050 --> 10:18.817
can be the best of the best.

10:20.754 --> 10:21.820
You know...

10:21.922 --> 10:24.390
Rolling Thunder is gonna
be out for a while...

10:24.892 --> 10:27.492
Ah! During the finale, I
caught the ol' hind leg

10:27.594 --> 10:30.830
in the Crushinator Jaws of
Smash-a-lot, patent pending.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.966
There's a spot on the team
if you want to join up.

10:37.403 --> 10:40.605
I appreciate the offer, but
I'm already a Wonderbolt.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.374
I'll do it! Can I do it?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.710
Lemme think: no?

10:45.312 --> 10:47.212
I wasn't asking <i>you</i>.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.414
Aw, you're cute.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.616
But technically, you haven't
"washed out" of the Bolts,

10:51.718 --> 10:53.852
which is kinda... our thing.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.555
And also... "No!"

10:56.657 --> 10:59.057
Oh! What if I joined and
dropped out super-quick?

10:59.359 --> 11:00.992
That's it! You're
coming with me!

11:01.962 --> 11:03.262
Where are we going?

11:03.464 --> 11:05.964
To hear what the actual
Wonderbolts think about you

11:06.066 --> 11:08.901
joining just to drop
out for the Washouts.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.003
Say "hi" to Spitfire for me!

11:20.180 --> 11:21.846
Ever seen two
simultaneous

11:21.948 --> 11:24.483
inverse displacement
rolls before?

11:24.585 --> 11:26.352
Pfft. Woulda been alot
cooler through the

11:26.453 --> 11:29.220
Crushinator Jaws of
Smash-a-lot, patent pending.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.790
You... What!?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.526
See, this is what I
was telling you about!

11:34.931 --> 11:35.964
I got this.

11:37.565 --> 11:39.798
You know what happens
when something goes <i>wrong</i>

11:39.900 --> 11:42.167
with the Crushinator
Jaws of Smash-a-lot?

11:42.469 --> 11:43.668
"...Patent pending?"

11:43.770 --> 11:46.505
You end up in a
full-body-wing-and-hoof cast

11:46.707 --> 11:48.374
drinkin' through a straw!

11:49.776 --> 11:51.376
But with enough practice...

11:51.478 --> 11:52.295
Practice!?

11:52.396 --> 11:55.613
Well, la-dee-<i> doodle</i> -da!

11:55.816 --> 11:57.782
Let me give you a
different scenario.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.217
You're probably
saying to yourself,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.219
"I'm young, I'm strong.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.756
I'm gonna go out there
and "stunt" some "tricks"

12:04.858 --> 12:07.425
with my new friend,
Lightning Dust.

12:07.627 --> 12:10.595
Well, I'm here to tell
you if you play that game,

12:10.697 --> 12:14.299
you're gonna find out it's
pretty hard to "stunt tricks"

12:14.401 --> 12:19.705
in a FULL-BODY-WING-AND-HOOF
CAST DRINKIN' THROUGH A STRAW!

12:20.207 --> 12:21.406
I think she
gets the point-

12:21.508 --> 12:23.174
I'M NOT FINISHED!

12:23.476 --> 12:26.611
Listen, I get it, kid.
I used to be like you.

12:26.813 --> 12:29.781
Tellin' myself: "I'm
gonna touch the sky!"

12:30.083 --> 12:30.716
I don't--

12:30.818 --> 12:33.785
Well,
WHOOP-DEE-DOODLE-DOO!

12:34.087 --> 12:36.421
You think you got it
made in the shade?

12:36.523 --> 12:39.024
Well, things are gonna
be pretty shady indeed

12:39.126 --> 12:42.193
when you can't go out in the
sun cause you're in

12:42.295 --> 12:47.365
a FULL-BODY-WING-AND-HOOF
CAST DRINKIN' THROUGH A STRAW!

12:47.467 --> 12:50.569
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

12:52.339 --> 12:54.873
Excellent.
Have a hat.

12:57.210 --> 13:01.113
Er, sorry. That was a
little... intense.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.149
I just want to make
sure you don't get hurt.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.751
That way you can
follow in my hoofsteps.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.954
Everypony's dream, right?

13:09.456 --> 13:11.756
More like "follow
your wing-flaps."

13:11.958 --> 13:12.824
Same difference.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.361
Thanks, "super-
talented flyer,"

13:16.463 --> 13:19.030
for clearing up
what <i>I</i> should do!

13:19.132 --> 13:21.900
Clearing things up is
one of my specialties.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.736
Now come on, let's go rip up
all your Washout posters

13:24.838 --> 13:27.472
into tiny pieces and
throw 'em off a cliff.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.678
I just thought of a great
way to raise awareness

13:33.780 --> 13:36.849
for your original fan club.
You know, the one about me.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.018
How about a silent
auction where every item

13:40.120 --> 13:41.653
is just a picture
of yours truly?

13:41.755 --> 13:43.655
Haha, nahhh, I'm just kidding.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.424
That makes me seem too
egotistical, doesn't it?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.359
OH OH! But maybe
if they're framed,

13:48.461 --> 13:50.995
it's like, "Wow, she's so
humble", you think?

13:52.999 --> 13:53.765
Scootaloo...?

13:54.835 --> 13:56.134
Er. Scootaloo?

13:57.871 --> 13:59.170
Anypony seen Scootaloo?

14:00.273 --> 14:03.241
My fault, my fault--
sorry, I... Twilight!

14:04.711 --> 14:07.345
Sorry, I was just, um...

14:08.782 --> 14:10.982
Please tell me you got that
stuff so you could rip it up

14:11.084 --> 14:12.284
and throw it off a cliff.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.485
They were doing an autograph
session before practice..

14:15.588 --> 14:17.922
Seriously? Ugh.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.758
You haven't seen
Scoot, have you?

14:19.860 --> 14:21.426
Actually...

14:24.197 --> 14:25.797
I can't believe
Scootaloo ditched me

14:25.899 --> 14:27.498
to watch them "practice"!

14:27.600 --> 14:29.868
Why can't she see how
dangerous they are?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.603
That's kind of
the whole draw.

14:31.705 --> 14:32.671
It's exciting.

14:32.772 --> 14:35.038
But it's like the harder
I try to convince Scoot

14:35.141 --> 14:37.809
they're dangerous, the
more she likes them!

14:38.211 --> 14:40.912
You can't control her
actions, only yours.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.082
Teach her what's safe and what
isn't, like a good role model,

14:44.284 --> 14:46.317
then hope she makes
the right decisions.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.953
But what if she
chooses them over me?

14:49.055 --> 14:50.422
She's gonna get hurt.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.057
I think I know somepony
else who might get hurt

14:53.159 --> 14:54.192
if that happens.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.128
Maybe you're right.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.529
But this isn't about me.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.665
I'm just worried about Scoot.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.572
Wow, you're really working
hard on this new stunt.

15:09.175 --> 15:13.411
WHAT KIND OF SORRY EXCUSE FOR
A TOMATO SANDWICH IS THIS?

15:17.150 --> 15:20.551
Sorry Dash, autograph
session's over.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.921
Unless you want to buy
Short Fuse's limited-edition

15:23.023 --> 15:24.489
half-eaten
tomato sandwich.

15:24.691 --> 15:28.694
I'M NOT SIGNING
THAT ABOMINATION!

15:29.296 --> 15:31.196
You haven't seen
Scootaloo, have you?

15:31.298 --> 15:35.500
Oh! Isn't she that pony
that used to respect you?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.704
I'd appreciate you
helping me find her...

15:39.806 --> 15:42.707
so I can apologize for trying
to make her quit liking you.

15:43.209 --> 15:47.712
[mean laugh] Oh, I'm pretty
sure she still likes us.

15:57.223 --> 15:59.490
Lightning Dust, I
know we go way back,

15:59.692 --> 16:01.692
but I can't let
her do this!

16:01.894 --> 16:04.395
I don't need <i>you</i>
standing up for me.

16:04.497 --> 16:08.633
Obviously you do, because you
can't see how dangerous this is.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.235
Do you not remember
what Spitfire said?

16:11.337 --> 16:12.971
Ugh, lemme guess,

16:13.473 --> 16:16.040
"You'll be in a
full-body-wing-and-hoof cast

16:16.142 --> 16:18.777
drinkin' through a straw!"

16:19.079 --> 16:20.945
That doesn't even
sound like Spitfire.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.981
That's it,
we're leaving!

16:25.218 --> 16:26.651
Just because I
look up to you

16:26.853 --> 16:28.820
doesn't mean I
have to BE you!

16:29.322 --> 16:32.590
But based on your definition
of what makes somepony great,

16:32.692 --> 16:36.160
I have bad news: I'll NEVER
be the "best of the best",

16:36.262 --> 16:40.632
or a Wonderbolt
because I. CAN'T. FLY.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.234
Is that what you wanted to hear?

16:44.737 --> 16:46.404
But not being able
to fly doesn't mean

16:46.506 --> 16:48.406
I can't do
something awesome,

16:48.508 --> 16:52.043
like strapping my scooter to a
multi-stage liquid-fuel rocket

16:52.145 --> 16:54.178
and jumping twenty
two wagons lined up

16:54.280 --> 16:56.147
in front of a
roaring crowd!

16:56.749 --> 16:58.182
That was awfully specific.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.186
That's cause it's what she'll
be doing in the show tonight.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.489
Half-off for Princesses!
Bring your friends.

17:05.291 --> 17:08.593
Scootaloo, are you sure that's
what you really want to do?

17:08.995 --> 17:10.261
Absolutely.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.932
And there's <i>nothing</i>
you can do to stop me!

17:14.234 --> 17:16.000
You're right. You're
your own foal

17:16.102 --> 17:18.203
and you have to make
your own decisions.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.139
Good. Because I already have.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.376
Oh.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.048
I'm sorry for making
us late again.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.049
Who would have guessed

17:31.151 --> 17:33.017
Scootaloo's Super-
Difficult-Stunt-Special

17:33.119 --> 17:36.220
Cupcakes would have been
so super-difficult to bake?

17:40.260 --> 17:43.196
Whoo wee, looks like all
of Ponyville's here...

17:44.898 --> 17:46.364
except for Rainbow Dash.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.799
[Announcer]<i> And here to</i>
<i> introduce the most</i>
<i> dangerous stunt</i>

17:49.902 --> 17:54.672
<i> we've ever performed, it's</i>
<i> your fearless captain...</i>

17:54.774 --> 17:58.576
<i> La La La Lightning Dust!</i>

18:04.484 --> 18:08.119
In just a moment, the newest
member of the Washouts

18:08.221 --> 18:12.857
will be ROCKET-SLEDDING down
that hill, up that ramp,

18:13.059 --> 18:17.862
and over all twenty-two wagons,
to land on the other side...

18:17.964 --> 18:19.298
in one piece...

18:19.600 --> 18:21.466
..heh ...if she's lucky.

18:21.568 --> 18:26.570
Put your hooves together
for HALF-PINT DYNAMITE!

18:28.942 --> 18:30.675
Whoo yeah!

18:36.149 --> 18:37.099
Lightning Dust?

18:37.500 --> 18:40.150
I have to tell you, I actually
started Equestria's first

18:40.253 --> 18:42.520
Washouts Fan Club...
as far as I know.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.923
So this is a real honor, ma'am.
Umm, do we call you ma'am?

18:46.025 --> 18:49.227
You land this jump, you can
call me whatever you want.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.933
Wow, that sure is...

18:55.135 --> 18:57.035
Dangerous? Nahh.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.669
Well, maybe a little.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.939
Has anypony tested it before?

19:01.341 --> 19:02.907
Where's the fun in that?

19:07.547 --> 19:09.314
There's MORE?

19:09.516 --> 19:11.949
You're not thinking of
backing out, are you?

19:12.051 --> 19:15.487
No! I'm just thinking about
drinking through straws.

19:16.089 --> 19:19.657
Are you the president
of my fan club, or not?

19:19.859 --> 19:21.209
Of course, it's just...

19:21.310 --> 19:23.160
You wouldn't want to get
impeached for dishonoring

19:23.263 --> 19:25.329
my wishes, would you?

19:25.431 --> 19:27.465
I-- Is that a thing?

19:29.802 --> 19:30.968
Light it up!

19:35.074 --> 19:38.276
OK, now I am thinking
about backing out!

19:38.378 --> 19:39.443
Too late!

19:55.795 --> 19:58.362
I know I was supposed to let
you make your own decisions,

19:58.464 --> 20:00.598
but that doesn't mean I
can't swoop in and save you

20:00.700 --> 20:01.866
from time to time.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.170
If I'd known you
were gonna bail,

20:06.272 --> 20:08.173
I would have done
the trick myself!

20:08.975 --> 20:10.741
Great! So you won't
mind how that rope's

20:10.843 --> 20:12.110
about to coil around your hoof!

20:14.080 --> 20:16.614
Rivals for LIFE!

20:18.418 --> 20:20.518
Wouldn't have it any other way.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.120
I'm sorry for joining
the Washouts...

20:23.222 --> 20:25.490
Lightning Dust wasn't
who I thought she was.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.893
She didn't care about me being
scared or putting me in danger.

20:28.995 --> 20:32.296
She only wanted a good show,
even if it meant I got hurt.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.200
That's not the kind of
pony I wanna look up to.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.502
I'm the one who should
be apologizing...

20:38.604 --> 20:42.039
for not acting like somepony
who deserves a fan club.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.774
I've been lucky enough
to have somepony

20:43.876 --> 20:45.476
who thinks I'm
the coolest,

20:45.678 --> 20:47.912
but there's nothing cool
about making you feel like

20:48.014 --> 20:50.448
you'll never be
as awesome as me.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.885
I think we should cancel
the Washouts Fan Club,

20:55.087 --> 20:58.990
because I know a fan club that
could use some new members.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.958
The Rainbow Dash Fan Club!

21:05.531 --> 21:07.198
Welcome to the
first ever meeting

21:07.300 --> 21:10.134
of the newest fan club
for the awesomest,

21:10.236 --> 21:14.038
previously under-appreciated
pony in Ponyville...

21:14.140 --> 21:15.740
with founding member and
president Rainbow Dash

21:15.842 --> 21:20.678
presiding, it's the...
Scootaloo Fan Club!

21:24.384 --> 21:26.484
You know, Rainbow
Dash was right.

21:26.586 --> 21:29.387
Eavesdropping on your own
fan club isn't weird at all.
