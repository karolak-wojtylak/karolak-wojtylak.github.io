WEBVTT

00:06.680 --> 00:08.240
Hey! Rainbow Dash!

00:10.320 --> 00:11.820
Hiya, Scootaloo! What's up?

00:12.160 --> 00:14.210
The Rainbow Dash fan
club just decided

00:14.500 --> 00:17.120
everypony's coming to see you
when the Wonderbolts' new tour

00:17.140 --> 00:18.280
comes through Ponyville!

00:18.620 --> 00:20.840
Well, it's great that you guys
are going to the show, Scoot,

00:20.920 --> 00:23.160
but I won't actually
be performing in it.

00:23.460 --> 00:24.580
Reservists aren't
in the show

00:24.600 --> 00:26.720
unless one of the real
Wonderbolts can't fly.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.920
I'll probably be working
crowd control or something.

00:31.220 --> 00:33.720
You're still gonna be
wearing a Wonderbolts uniform

00:33.740 --> 00:34.380
though, right?

00:34.660 --> 00:35.800
A Reservist one, yeah.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.440
Hmm. That's good
enough for me!

00:53.240 --> 00:54.480
Whoa!

00:54.920 --> 00:56.750
Rainbow Dash! Glad
we found you.

00:57.120 --> 01:00.560
We need you in the show when
we get to Ponyville. Flying.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.260
But she's only
in the Reserves!

01:03.780 --> 01:05.100
Not anymore, kid.

01:05.460 --> 01:07.620
You mean...

01:09.500 --> 01:14.000
Rainbow Dash! You're finally
a full-fledged Wonderbolt!

01:14.640 --> 01:17.300
Woo-hoo! Yeah!
Rainbow Dash! Woo!

01:19.900 --> 01:21.640
What
she said.

01:31.800 --> 01:41.140
Regular subtitles

http://yayponies.eu/

02:08.780 --> 02:11.740
Uh, anypony see my wing
balm? I don't wanna be stiff

02:11.780 --> 02:13.680
when I show up at
Wonderbolt headquarters.

02:14.340 --> 02:15.140
Got it.

02:16.540 --> 02:18.580
Do you have time to tell us
what happened, Rainbow Dash?

02:18.780 --> 02:21.170
Ooo yes, we must
know every detail!

02:21.460 --> 02:23.740
Start from when you were
a foal and you first knew

02:23.760 --> 02:26.300
your destiny was to
become a Wonderbolt!

02:27.040 --> 02:29.580
Well, not
much to tell, really.

02:30.060 --> 02:32.780
Spitfire told me the
Wonderbolts need me

02:32.820 --> 02:34.180
to go on tour with them.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.880
That's really great.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.640
I know how long you've been
waiting for a spot to open up.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.720
Yeah, Fire Streak decided to
retire and teach full-time.

02:43.100 --> 02:45.760
Cloudsdale Flight School will
probably be churning out

02:45.800 --> 02:46.900
Wonderbolts with him there.

02:47.180 --> 02:50.200
But guess who was at the
top of the Reserve list?

02:50.500 --> 02:52.560
Ooh ooh! I know! Pick me!

02:53.440 --> 02:55.000
So what do you
do now, Dashie?

02:55.360 --> 02:58.460
I have to report to
Wonderbolts Headquarters

02:58.860 --> 03:00.900
this afternoon. It's only
two days till tour starts

03:01.040 --> 03:02.400
and I need to learn
the routine.

03:02.460 --> 03:04.360
You're leaving already?

03:04.500 --> 03:06.740
But we barely started your
congratulation party!

03:06.900 --> 03:09.320
I haven't even thought about
your going away party yet.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.300
Pinkie, I'm not
leaving Ponyville.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.250
I just have to
train for this show.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.380
I hope everything
goes well.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.700
It sounds like an
awful lot of pressure,

03:18.880 --> 03:21.140
having to learn
everything so quickly.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.330
Yeah, good luck, Dash!

03:23.680 --> 03:26.680
Luck? Save that
for the rest of the team.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.520
Now that my awesomeness has
finally been recognized,

03:30.900 --> 03:32.640
the other Wonderbolts
will have to keep up

03:32.700 --> 03:34.510
or eat my cloud-trail.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.340
Everypony knows you're a
great flier, Rainbow Dash,

03:37.680 --> 03:39.400
but so are the rest
of the Wonderbolts.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.450
It might be more
challenging than you think.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.300
You're right.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.520
I mean, do I show up
wearing sunglasses or not?

03:47.940 --> 03:49.960
Sunglasses are
automatically cool,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.500
but anypony can
put them on.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.020
Maybe I'd stand out
more if I didn't.

03:58.820 --> 04:00.680
Team briefings are
every morning at--

04:00.720 --> 04:01.660
--oh seven twenty.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.700
Because there were twenty
ponies in the original

04:03.720 --> 04:05.600
EUP Guard that became
the Wonderbolts.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.540
Right. And I know you've
seen the Academy bunks,

04:08.800 --> 04:11.040
but these are the official
Wonderbolts' barracks--

04:11.260 --> 04:13.760
--built by Admiral
Fairweather himself!

04:15.640 --> 04:17.760
Don't forget rule
number one, newbie:

04:18.120 --> 04:21.580
always check both ways
before crossing the runway.

04:28.780 --> 04:32.140
Uh sure, but nopony
else is here!

04:32.480 --> 04:34.720
They will be. And most
of the Wonderbolts

04:34.740 --> 04:37.140
like to make a flashy
entrance, so stay alert.

04:37.620 --> 04:38.960
Right. No problem.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.000
Whoa! Is that
General Flash's cap?

04:45.200 --> 04:47.680
And the original crest with
the Wonderbolts motto on it.

04:47.900 --> 04:51.540
"Altius volantis."
"Soaring higher!"

04:52.120 --> 04:56.400
WOW! I mean... cool.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.120
OK, newbie, we've got
a show in two days,

05:00.160 --> 05:01.840
which means you've gotta
hustle your haunches

05:01.880 --> 05:02.860
to learn this routine.

05:03.180 --> 05:05.600
You've got five minutes to
get dressed and get outside

05:05.660 --> 05:07.000
to meet the rest of the team.

05:07.580 --> 05:09.440
Yes, ma'am! I'll have
all the moves down

05:09.460 --> 05:10.300
by the end of the day.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.440
Let's hope so. We're
all expecting you

05:12.480 --> 05:13.840
to make quite
an impression.

05:20.460 --> 05:24.700
Lookin' good! OK, you're about
to take your first flight

05:24.760 --> 05:30.180
as an actual Wonderbolt.
No pressure.

05:30.540 --> 05:33.430
Just gotta go out there and
knock 'em off their hooves.

05:33.820 --> 05:36.640
OK, Wonderbolts, get
ready to meet your most

05:36.660 --> 05:38.320
awesome member ever!

05:47.060 --> 05:48.540
Hey! Look out!

05:48.600 --> 05:49.080
Huh?

05:50.680 --> 05:51.520
Whoa!

06:04.600 --> 06:08.180
Whoa! Most awesome
entrance by a newbie ever!

06:08.460 --> 06:10.280
Are you OK, Rainbow Dash?

06:10.440 --> 06:12.700
More like Rainbow Crash!

06:18.080 --> 06:21.900
OK, flight school. Get
ready for Rainbow Dash!

06:24.200 --> 06:26.320
Whooooooooa!

06:32.320 --> 06:34.360
More like Rainbow Crash!

06:36.360 --> 06:44.140
Rainbow Crash, Rainbow Crash,
Rainbow Crash, Rainbow Crash!

06:46.760 --> 06:49.360
Hey! You guys buzzed
me on purpose!

06:49.600 --> 06:52.360
Not quite. You forgot
rule number one, newbie.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.760
"Always check both ways
before crossing the runway."

06:57.860 --> 07:01.000
Yeah, well, I was just...
testing you guys.

07:01.180 --> 07:06.420
Yeah, right.

07:06.480 --> 07:09.900
All right, nopony got hurt
and we've got a lot to do,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.280
so let's forget about
this and get flying.

07:12.820 --> 07:17.800
Classic rookie move, Rainbow
Crash. That was amazing.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.400
Higher, Crash! You're
breaking formation!

07:32.780 --> 07:34.620
Check your nine, Crash!

07:40.400 --> 07:42.520
Tighter, Crash! Get in there!

07:42.840 --> 07:45.440
My name's not Crash!

07:46.460 --> 07:49.220
Whoah!

07:50.320 --> 07:51.740
Huh! Coulda fooled me!

07:58.160 --> 08:00.520
Hey Crash, I know it
was a tough day today,

08:00.580 --> 08:02.320
but don't worry, you'll
get the hang of it.

08:02.920 --> 08:06.900
Tough day? Please. If I can
pull off a Sonic Rainboom,

08:06.960 --> 08:10.220
I can learn this routine. I'll
have it down cold tomorrow.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.140
Probably even come up with
a couple of improvements.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.900
Rainbow Dash, over here.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.140
Yes, ma'am?

08:16.420 --> 08:17.620
I'm glad you're
still here.

08:17.820 --> 08:19.860
Oh yeah? Did you want
some ideas on how

08:19.900 --> 08:22.000
to make the show
extra awesome?

08:22.300 --> 08:25.260
Not quite. I know you've
been a Reservist for a while,

08:25.300 --> 08:27.020
but the Bolts have a
few of their own rules

08:27.080 --> 08:28.280
you might not know about.

08:32.460 --> 08:34.000
Like worst flier
of the day

08:34.120 --> 08:36.110
has to clean up the
whole compound.

08:36.580 --> 08:37.940
Better get to it, Crash.

08:39.940 --> 08:42.760
My name's not Crash.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.640
Surprise!

08:54.980 --> 08:55.760
What?

08:56.440 --> 08:59.940
Hooray, Rainbow Dash!
Our favorite Wonderbolt!

09:02.320 --> 09:04.380
We know you're probably
tired, Rainbow Dash,

09:04.460 --> 09:06.900
but Pinkie wanted to
throw you a real party.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.310
Your Best Day EVER party!

09:09.620 --> 09:13.400
Yeah. It was
something, all right.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.520
Well, we can't wait
to hear all about it.

09:15.820 --> 09:19.000
And I'd love to
tell you. I really would.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.680
But I'm pretty beat.

09:23.180 --> 09:26.340
You know, from all the
excitement of my big day.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.540
Um, is something
wrong, Rainbow Dash?

09:31.860 --> 09:34.380
What could be wrong? I'm
finally a Wonderbolt,

09:34.440 --> 09:38.080
which means everything has to
be totally perfectly awesome.

09:38.540 --> 09:42.540
Oh no, something is wrong.
What happened, darling?

09:42.940 --> 09:44.540
I told you, it's nothing.

09:44.720 --> 09:48.180
I mean, maybe some of the
Wonderbolts started calling me

09:48.220 --> 09:49.360
"Rainbow Crash".

09:49.680 --> 09:52.480
Oh no! Isn't that the
same terrible nickname

09:52.520 --> 09:54.940
those bullies in flight
school used to call you?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.140
Why would they call you that?

09:58.500 --> 10:01.280
Well, I, kinda, sorta
fell into a garbage can.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.100
Ugh!

10:03.740 --> 10:05.340
Well, look at the
bright side!

10:05.580 --> 10:07.280
At least they didn't
call you Rainbow Trash!

10:07.980 --> 10:10.140
So you started off
on the wrong hoof.

10:10.340 --> 10:12.880
I bet every new Wonderbolt
has a tough first day.

10:13.180 --> 10:13.880
Um-hum!

10:14.100 --> 10:16.760
What you need is to find a
positive way to stand out.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.160
As soon as you're known
for something else,

10:19.400 --> 10:21.320
that nasty old nickname
will be forgotten.

10:21.840 --> 10:22.780
Rarity's right.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.120
Why don't you think of the
Wonderbolts like us?

10:25.320 --> 10:28.340
We're a team, but we all stand
out in different ways.

10:29.960 --> 10:34.440
That's it! I'm gonna stand out
in a different way.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.760
Just like you guys!

10:37.200 --> 10:40.660
Goodbye, Rainbow Crash,
hello, Captain Awesome!

10:47.160 --> 10:48.540
Good morning, everypony!

10:48.680 --> 10:51.520
Who's ready for a fantastic day
of flying? I know I am!

10:51.700 --> 10:52.720
I just couldn't be more excited

10:52.740 --> 10:55.220
for the big show tomorrow. Are
you guys excited? I'm excited!

10:55.340 --> 10:56.660
Actually, I'm always excited!

10:56.680 --> 10:59.220
Some ponies even call
me "Dynamic Dash"

10:59.420 --> 11:01.600
because I'm so full of
energy all the time!

11:02.680 --> 11:05.730
Uh, Wonderbolts don't
get excited, Crash.

11:05.860 --> 11:08.240
You gotta keep a level
head to fly the way we do.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.800
Well, of course I know that!

11:14.020 --> 11:17.380
But the truth of the matter is,
you should be excited.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.020
It's the dream of near every
little Pegasus pony

11:21.060 --> 11:23.520
to grow up and fly
with the Wonderbolts

11:23.740 --> 11:26.040
and here you all are doing it.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.410
So are you.

11:27.700 --> 11:31.260
True. Go ahead and call me
"Forthright Filly"

11:31.300 --> 11:35.690
if you want, but she-ucks, I
like to tell it like it is.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.840
And I believe a pony oughta
appreciate hard work

11:38.900 --> 11:41.500
paying off like this because
being a Wonderbolt

11:41.780 --> 11:43.560
is somethin' special.

11:43.960 --> 11:44.720
<i> We know.</i>

11:55.060 --> 11:57.800
You know, I was just reading
about how dihedral wing angles

11:57.840 --> 11:59.740
can help increase stability
in banking turns.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.620
It made me think that
pre-flight checklists

12:01.660 --> 12:03.460
could really help
increase our efficiency,

12:03.660 --> 12:05.380
so I went ahead and made
them for everypony.

12:08.340 --> 12:10.420
I'm always finding so much
interesting information

12:10.460 --> 12:12.760
in books. In fact, a lot of
ponies call me

12:13.040 --> 12:14.540
"Reading Rainboom."

12:15.020 --> 12:17.420
We all know how
wings work, newbie

12:17.580 --> 12:19.460
and we already have checklists!

12:19.700 --> 12:21.780
Now get off the runway!

12:25.020 --> 12:27.660
I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to help

12:27.700 --> 12:30.980
because I care about all of the
Wonderbolts oh so much.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.120
Yesiree, just call
me "Care Mare."

12:36.520 --> 12:39.640
Um, but if you're busy now, I
can just come back later.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.440
Or, you know, not at all.

12:47.620 --> 12:48.500
OK.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.740
I must tell you how much I
just love these uniforms!

12:54.800 --> 12:57.460
Why, ever since I was a foal,
I've admired the mixture

12:57.520 --> 12:59.720
of bold lines and
classic contours.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.240
They don't call me "Rainbow
Fash" for nothing!

13:03.020 --> 13:05.250
Uh...

13:05.560 --> 13:07.100
The "Fash" is for fashion.

13:07.700 --> 13:08.460
Crash!

13:10.120 --> 13:11.680
I'm not sure why you're
acting like this,

13:11.700 --> 13:12.760
but you need to stop.

13:13.940 --> 13:16.540
I was just, you know,
trying to show everypony

13:16.580 --> 13:19.360
all the awesome ways I can
contribute to the Bolts.

13:19.660 --> 13:21.600
I know you're excited to find
your place on the team,

13:21.800 --> 13:23.940
but just focus on the
routine for now, OK?

13:24.500 --> 13:25.260
Yes, ma'am.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.100
Maybe this will
help motivate you.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.280
"Crash?"

13:33.960 --> 13:35.980
Couldn't you just put
my regular name on it?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.540
That's not how it
works around here.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.880
We all have our nicknames on our
jackets. Right, Clipper?

13:41.240 --> 13:41.980
Clipper?

13:42.160 --> 13:43.160
Right, boss!

13:45.220 --> 13:48.360
Now it's official. Welcome to
the Wonderbolts, Crash!

13:51.740 --> 13:53.840
If I don't come up with
something unforgettable

13:53.880 --> 13:54.890
to add to the routine,

13:55.100 --> 13:58.120
I'm gonna be Rainbow Crash
for the rest of my life.

14:11.220 --> 14:13.420
This is gonna be so amazing!

14:13.580 --> 14:15.850
I know! I'm almost as
excited as Pinkie Pie!

14:15.960 --> 14:18.620
I can't wait to see Rainbow
Dash's first performance

14:18.640 --> 14:20.850
as an honest to
goodness Wonderbolt!

14:21.120 --> 14:22.820
I hope there's
cotton candy!

14:24.880 --> 14:27.600
We should all remember
to be extra supportive

14:27.660 --> 14:29.060
for Rainbow Dash, too.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.400
Excellent point. It's simply
dreadful that she's had

14:32.440 --> 14:35.320
such a rough start after
finally achieving her dream.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.820
Rainbow Dash is a pretty
resilient pony.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.400
I'm sure she's shaken
off her tough first day

14:40.460 --> 14:41.820
and turned it around by now.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.280
Speaking of - hey Dash!

14:46.350 --> 14:48.700
Oh, perfect! Hey, can
I borrow Scootaloo?

14:49.060 --> 14:50.460
Me? What for?

14:50.740 --> 14:52.860
Oh, I just
needed some help

14:52.900 --> 14:55.740
and figured the president of
the Rainbow Dash fan club

14:55.780 --> 14:57.880
was the right pony for the job.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.660
I thought the Wonderbolt
Reserves were here to help.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.980
Oh, yeah, they're all busy doing
official Reserves stuff.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.400
But don't worry, with
Scootaloo's help,

15:07.460 --> 15:10.340
everything's gonna be awesome.
Better than awesome.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.440
Does-does that mean practice
went well yesterday?

15:13.740 --> 15:14.680
Gotta go!

15:19.840 --> 15:21.960
What are we doing up here,
Rainbow Dash?

15:22.160 --> 15:23.940
I just need a small
favor from you

15:23.980 --> 15:26.400
that's really gonna make this
show something special.

15:26.780 --> 15:29.820
Now, the Wonderbolts are going
to fly over this ridge

15:29.860 --> 15:31.620
right before the
finale of the show.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.660
I'll fly by last and
when I signal you,

15:36.720 --> 15:38.540
you zip up the ramp
on your scooter

15:38.620 --> 15:40.680
and kick the storm
cloud into my path.

15:41.020 --> 15:41.660
What?

15:42.260 --> 15:44.700
That kick will shoot
off a lightning bolt

15:44.760 --> 15:47.900
right behind me, making
me look totally awesome!

15:48.100 --> 15:50.540
And then I'll do some
incredible Rainbow Dash flying

15:50.620 --> 15:53.520
with it, to create the
coolest, show-stoppingest,

15:53.620 --> 15:56.740
lightning-tastic light show
anypony has ever seen!

15:57.940 --> 15:59.720
Are you sure about this?

16:00.060 --> 16:02.840
It's gonna
be so awesome!

16:03.260 --> 16:07.360
And no pony will ever call me
"Rainbow Crash" after this.

16:08.280 --> 16:11.180
Oh, gotta go! Be ready for
me, OK, Scootaloo?

16:11.960 --> 16:14.260
Um, OK?

16:15.940 --> 16:19.680
Mares and gentlecolts, fillies
and foals of all ages,

16:19.900 --> 16:22.300
look to the skies and
prepare to be awestruck

16:22.340 --> 16:27.340
by the incredible flying
prowess of the Wonderbolts!

16:37.520 --> 16:39.900
I hope Spike and Pinkie Pie
are done getting their snacks

16:40.060 --> 16:41.840
or they're going to
miss Rainbow Dash!

16:42.220 --> 16:43.660
Oh don't worry, Fluttershy.

16:44.020 --> 16:46.330
Nothing could keep Pinkie
Pie from missing this.

16:46.700 --> 16:49.000
Except
maybe cotton candy.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.660
C'mon, Pinkie, the
show's starting!

16:53.800 --> 16:57.600
One second! Just a little bit
bigger, please, but hurry!

16:58.300 --> 16:59.280
Bigger!

17:16.780 --> 17:19.100
That was amazing!
She's doing great!

17:19.880 --> 17:21.230
Bigger!

17:39.320 --> 17:40.720
I hope this works!

17:54.500 --> 17:55.960
Ahhhh!

18:06.440 --> 18:07.620
Ahhh!

18:09.600 --> 18:11.920
Whoahh!

18:14.940 --> 18:15.900
Ahhhh!

18:16.080 --> 18:17.380
Whoah!

18:24.060 --> 18:25.240
Hope I'm not too late!

18:25.260 --> 18:27.660
Pfft! I don't know what
took that pony so long.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.600
Ahhh!

18:35.820 --> 18:38.360
That was amazing!

18:40.660 --> 18:43.020
Way to go, Rainbow Crash.

18:51.220 --> 18:53.260
You gonna tell us what
just happened, newbie?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.740
I am so sorry.

18:56.020 --> 18:56.860
I should hope so.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.180
You changed the routine
without consulting me

18:59.220 --> 19:00.580
and put other
ponies at risk.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.960
I've drummed flyers out
of the Bolts for less.

19:03.160 --> 19:07.470
I know and I'm ready for
whatever punishment you want.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.480
You guys were right to
call me Rainbow Crash.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.780
I've always been
a standout flier,

19:12.820 --> 19:14.600
but since I joined
the Wonderbolts,

19:15.160 --> 19:17.650
I've only stood out
for making mistakes.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.120
It's been my
dream my whole life,

19:21.200 --> 19:24.920
but I guess maybe I'm not
Wonderbolt material after all.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.180
Are you serious?

19:27.740 --> 19:30.730
You're the most talented
flier we've ever had.

19:31.060 --> 19:34.800
And you've saved all of
Equestria like, a dozen times!

19:35.040 --> 19:35.780
I-I--

19:35.880 --> 19:37.660
Of course you're supposed
to be a Wonderbolt!

19:37.900 --> 19:39.380
We've been waiting
for a spot to open up

19:39.440 --> 19:41.060
ever since you
joined the Reserves.

19:41.440 --> 19:45.240
But... you guys... all
called me Rainbow Crash.

19:45.580 --> 19:48.020
Yeah, so? My
nickname's Clipper.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.480
You know why they
call me that?

19:49.900 --> 19:51.980
Uh, cause you're as
fast as a ship?

19:52.420 --> 19:55.340
Because I clipped my
wing on a flagpole

19:55.400 --> 19:57.500
as I was landing on
my first day. Huh.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.260
Huh.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.180
Flatfoot. My first day I
misjudged my landing

20:03.240 --> 20:05.360
and came down right on
Spitfire's hoof.

20:06.180 --> 20:06.960
Daisy.

20:07.360 --> 20:07.960
Slowpoke.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.460
Hoof 'n' Mouth.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.100
You don't want to know
what they call me.

20:14.460 --> 20:18.420
Whoa, that is
so much worse than Crash.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.320
Right?

20:19.580 --> 20:22.400
So, does this mean I'm
still on the team?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.220
You think you can be
part of this team

20:24.280 --> 20:26.080
and not constantly
try to showboat?

20:26.360 --> 20:28.860
I promise. I spent my
whole life trying to be

20:28.940 --> 20:31.100
a standout flier, but now
that I'm a Wonderbolt,

20:31.400 --> 20:33.760
it's time to be OK
with fitting in.

20:34.240 --> 20:37.200
Good. Because I really didn't
want to miss the chance

20:37.260 --> 20:39.940
to tease you for years about
this catastrophe!

20:40.140 --> 20:42.340
I mean, that crash was epic!

20:45.060 --> 20:46.620
But you're on
probation for a month!

20:47.000 --> 20:48.060
Got a problem with that?

20:48.420 --> 20:49.020
No, ma'am.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.300
Hey Rainbow Dash, we just
wanted to check on you.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.580
Are you doing OK?

21:06.760 --> 21:08.260
I'm doing great, thanks!

21:08.620 --> 21:09.900
Sure you don't need any help?

21:10.280 --> 21:12.460
Nah. This mess is my
responsibility

21:12.500 --> 21:14.920
and I've gotta clean it up
myself. And after this,

21:15.120 --> 21:17.260
Spitfire's got me cleaning
the Wonderbolts compound

21:17.300 --> 21:18.100
for the next month.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.960
So why are you in
such a good mood?

21:23.180 --> 21:25.700
Duh! Because I'm a Wonderbolt!
