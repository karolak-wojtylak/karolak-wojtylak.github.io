00:02.117 --> 00:06.416
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

00:06.567 --> 00:08.966
You've really outdone yourselves,
Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

00:09.117 --> 00:13.113
This is sure to be the winning entry
of this year's National Dessert Competition!

00:13.264 --> 00:14.664
Oh, thank you Pinkie!

00:14.815 --> 00:18.154
And thanks for transporting it
all the way to Canterlot for us.

00:18.305 --> 00:20.336
Absolutely! It's my honor and I-

00:20.487 --> 00:23.273
Beg pardon but,
could we maybe move things along?

00:23.424 --> 00:26.196
This here cake's a mite heavy,
right Big Macintosh?

00:26.867 --> 00:28.308
Eeyup.

00:28.459 --> 00:30.129
All righty then, Big Mac!

00:32.217 --> 00:34.059
To the train depot!

00:36.316 --> 00:38.968
That's it Big Mac, nice and slow.

00:39.119 --> 00:40.964
This is precious cargo you're carrying.

00:41.115 --> 00:43.847
Yes, it took months
of planning and testing.

00:43.998 --> 00:45.098
I would hate for it to-

00:47.818 --> 00:48.966
Fall!

00:50.417 --> 00:51.946
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

00:52.097 --> 00:55.293
Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy,
a little pegassistance?

00:59.967 --> 01:01.909
I'll get it there safely, you'll see!

01:03.817 --> 01:04.851
Of course, Pinkie.

01:05.002 --> 01:06.502
We never doubted you.

01:12.917 --> 01:14.978
Twilight, can I see you a second?

01:16.174 --> 01:19.317
A nice protective spell
as extra insurance...

01:19.468 --> 01:20.568
Better safe than sorry.

01:25.372 --> 01:27.539
AJ, Rarity, one last thing?

01:32.490 --> 01:35.898
All right everypony,
we're in the home stretch here.

01:36.817 --> 01:40.280
See, Mr. and Mrs. Cake?
I got it here without a hitch!

01:40.616 --> 01:43.457
Now all we have to do is get it...

01:44.838 --> 01:46.239
in?

01:50.291 --> 01:55.291

02:31.629 --> 02:34.907
Thank you all for helping me get
the cake safely on the dessert car.

02:35.058 --> 02:37.675
Thank you for inviting us all
to go with you to Canterlot

02:37.825 --> 02:39.567
for the National Dessert Competition.

02:39.718 --> 02:42.324
I'm sure the festivities
will be just lovely.

02:42.475 --> 02:44.598
Fooey on the festivities,
I can't wait to try

02:44.749 --> 02:46.284
all those tasty treats!

02:48.056 --> 02:50.569
Well, the tastiest treat
of all is sure to be the Cake's

02:50.720 --> 02:53.685
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

02:53.836 --> 02:57.312
All that rich creamy goodness
of the marzipan,

02:57.463 --> 02:59.941
combined with the tart tanginess
of the mascarpone,

03:00.092 --> 03:04.998
blended perfectly with the smooth,
silky sweetness of the meringue...

03:05.149 --> 03:07.915
That's why I call the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness

03:08.066 --> 03:09.866
the "MMMM".

03:12.435 --> 03:13.725
Exactly.

03:13.876 --> 03:17.257
It's the most delicious delectable
delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria.

03:17.408 --> 03:19.800
And it's sure to win first prize.

03:19.801 --> 03:21.490
This is not so.

03:21.641 --> 03:23.544
For I, Gustave Le Grand,

03:23.695 --> 03:28.262
do challenge your crude cake
to a duel of delectable delacacies

03:35.035 --> 03:37.595
They will undoubtedly strike down
all the competition,

03:37.746 --> 03:40.122
winning first prize and crowning me...

03:40.273 --> 03:41.773
<i>le champion!</i>

03:41.924 --> 03:43.553
Not a chance, Le Grand.

03:43.829 --> 03:44.904
Doughnut Joe!

03:45.055 --> 03:46.831
What are you doing in Ponyville?

03:46.982 --> 03:51.486
Picking up the final all-important
ingredient for my contest entry...

03:51.637 --> 03:54.382
"Doughnutopia"!

03:54.533 --> 03:56.511
And with these super-sprinkles,

03:56.662 --> 04:01.164
my doughnuts are gonna dunk all
the other lousy desserts steal first prize,

04:01.315 --> 04:03.565
and make my doughnut shop famous...

04:03.716 --> 04:05.264
forever!

04:05.791 --> 04:11.364
Oh, Joe... your dippy doughnuts
could never outrun me.

04:12.685 --> 04:15.254
Hello. What's your name?

04:15.405 --> 04:18.203
I am Mulia Mild.

04:18.354 --> 04:21.934
Behold, my chocolate mousse moose.

04:22.085 --> 04:25.898
It will trample all your treats,
be given first prize,

04:26.049 --> 04:30.081
and make me the greatest chef
in Equestria...

04:31.185 --> 04:35.301
Madame Mild, you and your
mousse moose are mistaken.

04:38.716 --> 04:41.108
The Cakes'
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness

04:41.259 --> 04:42.419
is going to win!

04:42.570 --> 04:46.409
Your simple cake could never
take my moose.

04:53.384 --> 04:56.875
Well, it sure looks like we're in
for a delicious competition tomorrow.

04:57.026 --> 04:59.585
Maybe we should all settle in
for a good night's sleep.

05:10.534 --> 05:12.657
I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.

05:12.808 --> 05:15.288
Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself.

05:16.385 --> 05:18.367
Wait! Didn't you hear those chefs?

05:18.518 --> 05:20.442
We have to protect "MMMM".

05:20.793 --> 05:21.993
Mmmm?

05:22.144 --> 05:23.344
Mmm hmm.

05:23.495 --> 05:26.936
I know for super sure that "MMMM"
is the best dessert in all of Equestria.

05:27.087 --> 05:28.613
And I know that they know it too.

05:28.764 --> 05:29.864
So...

05:30.015 --> 05:33.546
So... one of them is going to
sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight!

05:33.697 --> 05:35.420
You have to help me stand guard!

05:35.571 --> 05:37.816
Pinkie, you're overreacting.

05:37.967 --> 05:40.334
Yeah, those chefs aren't gonna
do your cake any harm.

05:40.485 --> 05:42.779
But they are! I just know it.

05:42.930 --> 05:45.391
Fine!
If you wanna stand guard, go for it.

05:45.542 --> 05:46.942
We're going to bed.

05:54.935 --> 05:56.007
I'll show them.

05:56.158 --> 05:57.935
I'll stay up all night and protect you.

05:58.086 --> 06:02.080
Nothing and nopony will stop me
from keeping you safe.

06:18.388 --> 06:20.131
Stop, you saboteur!

06:25.697 --> 06:27.585
I have you now!

06:53.185 --> 06:55.205
Thank Celestia, you're okay!

06:55.356 --> 06:58.165
But one of those bakers
is mixing up something bad.

06:58.316 --> 07:00.851
So I'm not leaving you again,
no matter what.

07:03.785 --> 07:05.055
Who turned out the moon?

07:05.585 --> 07:07.563
Don't go near that cake, thief!

07:08.185 --> 07:09.432
Stop, thief!

07:09.583 --> 07:11.468
Oh, are you okay thief?

07:21.025 --> 07:23.124
Overreacting my hoof.

07:23.275 --> 07:25.585
I knew I was going to have
to keep a close eye on you.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.157
And that's just what I'm gonna do.

07:42.031 --> 07:43.003
The cake!

07:44.642 --> 07:48.219
You look mmmm-marvelous.

07:52.535 --> 07:57.459
I know. I think some congratulations
are in order for a job well done.

07:57.785 --> 08:02.483
You better hold off on giving yourself
an award just yet Pinkie... look!

08:02.634 --> 08:03.947
Look at what?!

08:13.721 --> 08:14.803
What is it?

08:14.954 --> 08:15.878
What happened?

08:16.029 --> 08:18.021
It's the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

08:18.172 --> 08:20.600
It's been... mutilated!

08:21.832 --> 08:24.228
Now, we just need
to find out who done it.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.121
You mean, who "did it".

08:27.272 --> 08:28.978
Exactly. Who did-done-dood it.

08:29.429 --> 08:31.538
Well, having read many mystery novels,

08:31.689 --> 08:34.978
I know that the only way to
discover the culprit is to investigate.

08:35.129 --> 08:36.129
Exactly.

08:40.444 --> 08:43.731
And as chief detective,
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

08:44.744 --> 08:47.355
- You're investigatin'?
- Yes!

08:47.506 --> 08:49.532
And Twilight shall be
my lowly assistant

08:49.683 --> 08:52.809
who asks silly questions
with obvious answers.

08:53.621 --> 08:55.127
Fine, Pinkie.

08:55.278 --> 08:57.339
Should we start looking for clues?

08:57.790 --> 09:00.075
Perfect silly question,
my dear Twilight.

09:00.226 --> 09:02.452
Because the obvious answer is...

09:02.603 --> 09:04.158
Yes?

09:04.309 --> 09:06.718
No! 'Cause I know who did it.

09:08.338 --> 09:10.862
Pinkie, how could you possibly know?

09:11.013 --> 09:12.894
How could I possibly not know?

09:13.045 --> 09:15.656
Clearly, this dastardly deed
was done by the baker

09:15.807 --> 09:17.629
who knew their dessert
could not measure up

09:17.780 --> 09:21.441
to the mastery of the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

09:25.038 --> 09:26.844
Gustave!

10:01.569 --> 10:03.878
Thus, destroying the cake,
and the Cakes' chance

10:04.028 --> 10:06.267
of winning the
National Dessert Competition.

10:06.418 --> 10:07.918
But it makes no sense!

10:08.069 --> 10:09.832
What do you mean, lowly assistant?

10:09.983 --> 10:12.209
Well first, if you were tied
to the train tracks,

10:12.360 --> 10:13.648
how are you now here?

10:16.178 --> 10:18.288
Guess that isn't
a totally silly question.

10:18.439 --> 10:21.778
And second, the cake hasn't been sliced,
it's been bitten.

10:21.929 --> 10:23.544
Just look at the teeth marks!

10:24.282 --> 10:26.626
You're right, my fine fellow.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.698
Gustave Le Grand
is clearly in the clear.

10:29.849 --> 10:33.036
Which means the "MMMM"
was destroyed by another baker.

10:33.187 --> 10:36.741
A baker whose doughnuts are do-nots.

10:36.892 --> 10:39.661
That's right, it was Joe!

10:43.528 --> 10:48.151
Or as he's known in the spy world,
Mane. Con Mane.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.240
Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!

11:38.628 --> 11:39.678
Pinkie!

11:39.829 --> 11:42.317
There is no laser beam security system.

11:42.468 --> 11:45.031
And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane!

11:45.182 --> 11:46.971
He's big, gruff, and messy!

11:48.383 --> 11:51.664
Although, you would look
rather dapper in a tuxedo.

11:52.488 --> 11:54.578
You may be right, lowly assistant.

11:54.729 --> 11:55.798
May be?

11:55.949 --> 11:58.278
Now that I'm taking
a closer look at these desserts,

11:58.429 --> 12:01.907
I see that one simply cannot
look me in the eye.

12:02.058 --> 12:04.774
Pinkie... that moose is a mousse!

12:04.925 --> 12:05.825
Yes!

12:05.976 --> 12:10.467
And the mule behind the moose panicked
when she saw the mastery of the "MMMM".

12:10.618 --> 12:13.230
So you're saying that the culprit is...

12:13.381 --> 12:15.748
Mulia Mild!

12:42.510 --> 12:46.052
Putting an end to the Cakes'
dreams of taking first prize.

12:46.353 --> 12:49.858
I hope you're proud of yourself, Mulia.

12:50.009 --> 12:53.128
Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous!
Look at her!

12:56.180 --> 12:57.388
I guess you're right...

12:57.539 --> 12:58.539
Thank you!

12:58.690 --> 13:01.193
But I was so sure that it was
one of the other bitter bakers

13:01.344 --> 13:02.944
that destroyed the "MMMM".

13:03.095 --> 13:06.158
That way, their delicious dessert
would reign supreme.

13:06.309 --> 13:09.086
I mean, just look at Joe's Doughnutopia.

13:09.237 --> 13:12.678
It's a spectacular city
of doughnutty delight,

13:12.829 --> 13:16.358
topped temptingly
in sprinklicious sprinkles.

13:21.767 --> 13:25.218
But then, there's
Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose.

13:25.669 --> 13:29.557
Why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous
mousse moose tempts the taste buds

13:29.708 --> 13:33.527
with this silky, smooth, yummy-nummy,
chocolateyness.

13:33.678 --> 13:37.281
So, why did this criminal devour the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness

13:37.432 --> 13:40.253
while leaving this trio
of tasty treats untouched?

13:50.958 --> 13:54.288
Now I have no idea who do-doned it!

13:59.591 --> 14:02.587
This mystery gets more mysterious
every minute.

14:02.738 --> 14:06.254
Well, you have to stop the wild
accusations and get to the truth.

14:06.405 --> 14:09.970
Everypony go back to your cars
while we do a little investigating.

14:12.127 --> 14:15.298
Okay Pinkie, in order to
really solve this mystery,

14:15.449 --> 14:17.871
we're going to have to find clues.

14:19.827 --> 14:22.810
Now you were here,
at the scene of the crime all night.

14:23.227 --> 14:25.254
You're not accusing me, are you?

14:25.505 --> 14:26.654
No!

14:26.805 --> 14:29.437
But maybe you saw something
that will help us.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.977
I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!

14:32.128 --> 14:34.897
Good... let's retrace your steps.

14:40.607 --> 14:44.255
Then, I chased the culprit down
the train towards the caboose.

14:45.047 --> 14:47.360
But when I got there, he was gone.

14:53.515 --> 14:55.561
Our first clue.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.827
I think I know who did it, Pinkie.

15:02.978 --> 15:04.507
- Already?
- Yes.

15:04.658 --> 15:06.770
But I need more evidence to confirm.

15:06.921 --> 15:08.330
Tell me what happened next.

15:08.681 --> 15:13.729
I heard somepony else in the dessert car,
and chased them up to the engine.

15:14.527 --> 15:18.727
But, when I got there, all I saw
was the conductor shoveling coal.

15:18.878 --> 15:20.630
The conductor, huh?

15:23.807 --> 15:25.982
But, that doesn't make any sense.

15:34.035 --> 15:35.863
What happened next, Pinkie?

15:36.014 --> 15:38.787
Well... I went back to the dessert car.

15:50.182 --> 15:51.352
Yes?

15:53.110 --> 15:56.434
The curtains mysteriously closed,
all on their own.

15:56.585 --> 15:59.202
Interesting. Anything else?

15:59.353 --> 16:01.869
I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud.

16:02.777 --> 16:04.256
And then they were gone!

16:04.495 --> 16:07.327
When I opened the curtains,
I saw that the portrait by the door

16:07.478 --> 16:08.778
was all crooked.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.448
Oh my, what is that?

16:19.677 --> 16:21.195
What next, Pinkie?

16:21.687 --> 16:25.015
That's it. I was here guarding
the cake the rest of the night.

16:27.655 --> 16:30.879
I mean... I slept by the cake
the rest of the night.

16:31.030 --> 16:33.326
And when you woke up,
half the cake was gone?

16:33.477 --> 16:34.277
Exactly.

16:34.628 --> 16:36.654
By Jove, I think I've got it.

16:36.805 --> 16:38.601
Call everypony back.

16:38.752 --> 16:40.708
We have a cake culprit to catch.

16:44.594 --> 16:46.701
Why are we all here again?

16:47.452 --> 16:50.180
I bet you're wondering
why you're all here again.

16:50.331 --> 16:51.831
She's good.

16:52.227 --> 16:55.794
We have discovered the true culprit
of this cake carnage.

16:56.478 --> 16:57.574
But how?

16:57.825 --> 17:00.344
Well you see, when committing a crime,

17:00.495 --> 17:03.329
it's crucial that one
never leaves behind clues.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.134
Especially an obvious clue like... this.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.359
A blue feather.

17:10.510 --> 17:14.268
I knew it was you, Gustave Le Grand.

17:14.419 --> 17:17.436
Pinkie, Gustave doesn't
have blue feathers.

17:17.587 --> 17:20.335
No, 'cause he's been dying them!

17:20.859 --> 17:22.297
No, Pinkie.

17:22.448 --> 17:24.375
Remember how when you chased
the suspect to the caboose,

17:24.526 --> 17:25.826
they suddenly disappeared?

17:25.977 --> 17:28.246
That's because they flew away.

17:28.397 --> 17:31.104
But the thief did leave
a little something behind...

17:31.255 --> 17:33.845
didn't you, Rainbow Dash?

17:34.715 --> 17:36.274
I don't even like cake!

17:36.425 --> 17:40.647
So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!

17:40.798 --> 17:43.477
Case not solved, because
when we went to the engine,

17:43.628 --> 17:44.828
I saw the conductor's hat.

17:44.979 --> 17:48.598
And inside the hat was... this.

17:49.537 --> 17:53.538
So it was you, that pink hair came
from your rainbow colored mane!

17:53.689 --> 17:56.272
I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!

17:56.423 --> 17:57.423
So you're wearing a wig?

17:58.427 --> 17:59.437
Cut it out!

17:59.438 --> 18:01.165
Pinkie, remember?

18:01.316 --> 18:04.042
You chased a pony to the engine,
where you thought you saw

18:04.193 --> 18:05.517
the conductor shoveling coal.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.433
But that wasn't the conductor at all.

18:07.584 --> 18:09.823
It was... Fluttershy.

18:11.607 --> 18:13.773
You're going down, Fluttershy.

18:13.924 --> 18:14.924
Pinkie!

18:16.075 --> 18:18.674
But then another clue
confounded my suspicions.

18:19.248 --> 18:22.550
You were guarding the cake
when the curtains mysteriously closed.

18:22.701 --> 18:25.070
But that's no mystery, that's magic.

18:25.221 --> 18:27.545
But when the thief tried
to make their great escape,

18:27.696 --> 18:30.320
they left a little addition to the portrait.

18:32.995 --> 18:35.327
Has anypony else noticed
that Rarity is wearing

18:35.478 --> 18:37.141
her hair rather differently today?

18:38.257 --> 18:41.667
What? Is it a crime to change
one's style every now and again?

18:41.818 --> 18:43.803
Why, I think it's a crime not to.

18:43.904 --> 18:45.377
Really?

18:48.473 --> 18:50.036
Fine, I'm guilty!

18:50.187 --> 18:51.932
I wear false eyelashes.

18:53.529 --> 18:55.353
Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.

18:55.754 --> 18:56.904
So did I.

18:57.055 --> 18:59.285
Oh nuts, so did I.

18:59.436 --> 19:01.360
You just made it sound
so delectable.

19:01.511 --> 19:02.511
So tasty.

19:02.662 --> 19:04.419
And boy was it!

19:04.770 --> 19:07.763
I only meant to take a little,
lady-like bite.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.214
And it was so good.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.466
Yeah, I just dove right in!

19:11.617 --> 19:13.647
But I'm really really sorry.

19:13.798 --> 19:15.098
Terribly sorry.

19:15.649 --> 19:17.095
Sorry, Pinkie.

19:17.246 --> 19:18.805
That's okay.

19:18.956 --> 19:22.191
At least this mystery
is finally solved.

19:22.342 --> 19:23.242
But it isn't.

19:23.393 --> 19:26.030
We figured out who ate the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness,

19:26.181 --> 19:29.290
but we still don't know who devoured
the other bakers' goods.

19:29.441 --> 19:32.195
You're right, Twilight.
You know what we have to do?

19:32.346 --> 19:35.538
Well, yes I do. Do you?

19:35.689 --> 19:37.927
Look for clues!

19:47.716 --> 19:51.092
Well, Pinkie. Did you find
the devourer of the desserts?

19:51.343 --> 19:55.753
I most certainly did.
It was, none other than...

19:55.927 --> 19:58.738
the bakers!

19:59.805 --> 20:04.097
First of all, Gustave has mousse
in his moustache.

20:11.424 --> 20:15.233
And Mulia has sprinkles
in her freckles!

20:16.617 --> 20:18.427
What do you say, bakers?

20:18.778 --> 20:20.827
Oh I am so sorry, Mulia.

20:20.978 --> 20:24.445
But Pinkie made your
mousse moose sound...

20:30.943 --> 20:34.491
And the way she spoke
of your Doughnutopia,

20:34.642 --> 20:37.507
it was too delectable to resist.

20:41.673 --> 20:44.938
Well everypony,
we finally have the mystery solved.

20:45.089 --> 20:49.124
Yes, but now we don't have any desserts
to enter into the contest!

20:49.275 --> 20:52.663
I think we can fix that. Come on!

20:54.947 --> 20:56.833
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

20:56.984 --> 21:00.473
<i>today I learned that it's not good
to jump to conclusions.</i>

21:00.624 --> 21:04.146
<i>You have to find out all the facts
before saying somepony did something.</i>

21:04.297 --> 21:08.477
<i>If you don't, you could end up blaming
somepony for something they never did.</i>

21:08.628 --> 21:13.613
<i>This could hurt their feelings,
and it can make you look really foolish.</i>

21:13.764 --> 21:17.793
<i>So from now on, I'll always
make sure to get all the facts.</i>

21:18.513 --> 21:20.970
How's that for a lesson,
Princess Celestia?

21:23.567 --> 21:25.019
Care for a bite?

21:25.420 --> 21:27.887
I don't mind if I do.
