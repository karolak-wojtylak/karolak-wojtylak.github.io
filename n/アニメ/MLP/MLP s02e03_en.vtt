WEBVTT

00:07.217 --> 00:07.773
Quill.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.454
Check.

00:10.612 --> 00:11.475
Parchment.

00:11.476 --> 00:12.209
Check.

00:12.210 --> 00:13.035
Extra ink.

00:13.036 --> 00:13.557
Check.

00:13.558 --> 00:14.968
Extra-extra ink.

00:14.969 --> 00:15.894
Check.

00:16.193 --> 00:17.850
Is that everything on the checklist?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.186
-Yep!
-Great.

00:19.187 --> 00:22.521
Now that we've completed the checklist
of things we need to create a checklist...

00:22.522 --> 00:25.984
...we can make my checklist of the things
I have to get done by the end of the day.

00:26.217 --> 00:27.274
Ready?

00:27.432 --> 00:28.462
Ready!

00:28.463 --> 00:32.835
Item 1: Create checklist of the things
I have to accomplish by the end of the day.

01:18.925 --> 01:19.956
How are we doing, Spike?

01:20.207 --> 01:21.343
Let's see...

01:21.344 --> 01:23.136
We've already dropped off
your cape at the cleaner's...

01:23.137 --> 01:25.133
...returned the blackboard
you borrowed from Cheerilee...

01:25.134 --> 01:27.574
...ordered new parchment and quills
from the stationery shop...

01:27.633 --> 01:31.064
Hmm... Seems like we just placed
an order for those a few days ago.

01:32.406 --> 01:35.158
Can imagine why we go
through so many of them.

01:35.375 --> 01:38.213
Sounds like we're ahead
of schedule. What's next?

01:38.679 --> 01:40.215
Cupcakes!

01:44.463 --> 01:46.512
Uh, I only ordered twelve.

01:46.513 --> 01:47.944
Oh, I know, dear.

01:47.945 --> 01:51.552
But I had an extra, so I though
I'd make it a baker's dozen.

01:53.592 --> 01:55.366
Oh, that was very thoughtful of you.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.884
It's just some of the icing
from the extra cupcake...

01:57.885 --> 02:00.778
...is getting all over
the one next to it. See?

02:02.454 --> 02:04.172
Oh! Sure.

02:04.173 --> 02:06.533
It's just that I'm planning on
sharing these at a picnic later...

02:06.534 --> 02:10.090
...and I don't want anypony to feel like
somepony else is getting more icing.

02:10.862 --> 02:13.798
Oh... no, of course not.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.418
Not to worry.

02:15.454 --> 02:17.649
I'll just move some of this one to...

02:18.029 --> 02:20.980
Hmm... I think I may have
scooped too much.

02:21.107 --> 02:23.252
Oops! Now those two have more.

02:23.487 --> 02:25.189
Let's just try this again.

02:27.378 --> 02:29.747
Hmm... No, that won't do.

02:30.023 --> 02:33.062
Let me just... hmm...
put some here, then...

02:33.119 --> 02:37.408
No, that's not right. A little more
on this one, a little bit... wait...

02:37.409 --> 02:42.079
I'll just... Ooh, a little bit
here... here... and...

02:42.231 --> 02:43.295
Perfect!

02:44.292 --> 02:46.791
Hmm, oh yes. Much better.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.583
Okay! Time to tackle
the next item on our...

02:49.584 --> 02:50.705
Oops!

02:50.706 --> 02:54.582
Looks like we're gonna have to add
"Give a baby dragon a bath" to our list.

02:58.406 --> 03:02.029
Very efficient! And a little bit gross.

03:03.587 --> 03:04.855
Looks like that's everything.

03:05.046 --> 03:06.769
Almost everything.

03:06.770 --> 03:10.289
"Triple-check checklist to make sure
we didn't miss anything..."

03:10.290 --> 03:12.701
"...when the double-checked
the checklist".

03:12.776 --> 03:14.409
Uh, check.

03:15.401 --> 03:19.738
I've been holding that quill so long
I've got a claw cramp.

03:20.846 --> 03:24.234
Good thing we don't have anything
to report to Princess Celestia this week.

03:24.235 --> 03:26.264
I don't think I can write another word.

03:26.428 --> 03:29.354
We haven't sent a letter
to Princess Celestia this week?!

03:29.355 --> 03:30.966
Why? Is that bad?

03:30.967 --> 03:33.309
Bad?! BAD?! Of course it's bad!

03:33.310 --> 03:35.912
I'm supposed to send Princess
Celestia a letter every week...

03:35.913 --> 03:38.020
...telling her about a lesson
I've learned about friendship!

03:38.021 --> 03:40.402
Not every other week.
Not every ten days.

03:40.403 --> 03:42.736
Every! Single! Week!

03:44.183 --> 03:46.607
Where's my calendar?!
Where's my calendar?!

03:46.608 --> 03:49.002
Where it always is?

03:49.872 --> 03:51.882
When did we send the last one?

03:52.057 --> 03:54.124
Last Tuesday?

03:54.285 --> 03:56.457
And today is...

03:56.985 --> 03:57.964
Tuesday?

03:59.162 --> 04:00.924
Nonononononono...

04:02.469 --> 04:04.911
If I don't send her a letter
by sundown, I'll be...

04:05.739 --> 04:07.784
TARDY!!!

04:08.704 --> 04:09.867
What's that now?

04:09.868 --> 04:12.892
Tar-dy, Spike. Late! I'll be late!

04:13.093 --> 04:16.706
Oh, how could I've let this happen?
I'm usually so organized.

04:16.707 --> 04:18.694
I've never been late for an assignment.

04:18.695 --> 04:21.556
Oh, please! You're the most
studious student ever.

04:21.557 --> 04:24.994
I'm sure the princess will forgive you
if you miss one little deadline.

04:24.995 --> 04:27.099
I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.161
This is the ruler of all of Equestria
we're talking about.

04:30.162 --> 04:32.620
The pony who holds
my fate in her hooves.

04:33.801 --> 04:35.189
What if she doesn't forgive me?

04:35.190 --> 04:36.931
Yeah, I don't think she...

04:36.932 --> 04:38.313
What if instead she starts thinking...

04:38.314 --> 04:40.969
...I'm not taking my studies
on friendship seriously?

04:40.970 --> 04:41.609
Why would she...

04:41.610 --> 04:44.236
What if she makes me come back to
Canterlot and puts me back in school...

04:44.237 --> 04:47.889
...and makes me *prove* I've been
taking them seriously by giving me a task?

04:48.067 --> 04:49.804
What if I don't pass?!

04:49.840 --> 04:52.698
-But why wouldn't you pass...
-She's my teacher!

04:52.699 --> 04:55.776
Do you know what teachers do
to students who don't pass?

04:56.774 --> 04:59.009
THEY SEND THEM BACK A GRADE!

04:59.010 --> 05:00.649
But she won't just send me back a grade.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.389
She'll send me back to...

05:02.935 --> 05:04.968
...magic kindergarten.

05:11.927 --> 05:13.098
Twilight.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.151
Twilight!

05:15.668 --> 05:18.629
That is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard!

05:18.630 --> 05:21.576
You're not gonna be sent back
to magic kindergarten.

05:21.577 --> 05:24.594
You're right. I have no reason to worry.

05:24.694 --> 05:26.890
Because I'm going to solve
a friend's problem...

05:26.891 --> 05:30.491
...and get that letter to Princess
Celestia before sundown!

05:31.303 --> 05:32.703
So...

05:32.789 --> 05:35.061
Got any problems, troubles, conundrums
or any other sort of issues...

05:35.062 --> 05:38.667
...major or minor, that I as a good
friend could help you solve?

05:44.094 --> 05:45.462
I got nothin'.

05:47.141 --> 05:50.694
Then it looks like I'm gonna have to
find somepony who does.

05:52.282 --> 05:54.184
This won't end well.

05:58.832 --> 06:00.137
You've got this, Twilight.

06:00.138 --> 06:03.598
You still have plenty of time to
get that letter to Princess Celestia.

06:03.599 --> 06:07.272
Has to be somepony around here
who needs the help of a good friend.

06:08.675 --> 06:09.958
Rarity!

06:13.371 --> 06:16.511
Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!

06:16.627 --> 06:19.117
Why me?

06:19.118 --> 06:22.099
WHY, WHY, WHY?!

06:22.100 --> 06:24.575
Of all the worst things
that could happen...

06:24.576 --> 06:28.582
...this is the! Worst! Possible! Thing!

06:30.352 --> 06:32.587
What's happened?! Are you all right?

06:33.046 --> 06:36.579
I've lost my diamond
encrusted purple ribbon!

06:36.580 --> 06:39.262
I have searched HIGH!
And I have searched low.

06:39.263 --> 06:40.974
LOW AND HIGH!
High and low.

06:41.759 --> 06:43.523
But I can't find it anywhere!

06:44.105 --> 06:46.573
ANYWHERE!

06:47.103 --> 06:51.425
How can I possibly finish
my latest creation if I can't find it?

06:51.622 --> 06:55.252
Never fear, Rarity. As your friend
I'll do my best to help you fi...

06:55.253 --> 06:56.634
Oh, there it is.

06:56.635 --> 06:59.509
Isn't it always just
the last place you look.

07:00.666 --> 07:04.429
So you just lost your ribbon...

07:06.191 --> 07:08.229
...but now you've found it.

07:08.230 --> 07:09.212
Yeah.

07:09.213 --> 07:11.697
And nothing else is bothering you?

07:11.698 --> 07:15.326
Nothing that I as a good friend
could help you with?

07:17.141 --> 07:19.178
There is one thing.

07:19.289 --> 07:20.571
YES?!

07:20.572 --> 07:22.880
I think I've left my measuring tape
under the fabric over there.

07:22.881 --> 07:24.552
Could you get that for me?

07:27.052 --> 07:29.379
Measuring tape. Sure.

07:29.709 --> 07:32.264
Twilight. Is there something bother...

07:33.092 --> 07:34.419
Twilight.

07:38.696 --> 07:41.529
No need to panic.
Rarity is just one pony.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.909
I'm sure one of my other
friends will need me.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.720
What in the world...

08:04.570 --> 08:07.173
Rainbow must be angry with Applejack!

08:07.174 --> 08:10.635
She must hate her guts. Oh, wonderful!

08:11.210 --> 08:13.411
Rainbow Dash! Stop!

08:14.583 --> 08:18.980
Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset
with Applejack, but don't worry.

08:18.981 --> 08:21.187
Whatever it is that has
come between you two...

08:21.188 --> 08:25.985
...I'm sure that I as a good friend
can help you resolve your problems.

08:27.194 --> 08:29.518
Uh, what are you talking about?

08:29.575 --> 08:31.418
Oh, Rainbow Dash.

08:31.419 --> 08:33.561
You don't have to hide
your feelings from me.

08:33.562 --> 08:36.399
I can tell you two must
have had a terrible fight.

08:36.715 --> 08:41.250
Now, why don't you tell me all
about your issues with Applejack?

08:41.251 --> 08:43.445
I don't have any issues with Applejack.

08:43.446 --> 08:46.931
You don't? Then why are you
destroying her property?

08:46.932 --> 08:48.464
Because she asked me to.

08:48.465 --> 08:49.832
Right, Applejack?

08:49.833 --> 08:51.026
Yes, ma'am.

08:51.027 --> 08:54.553
I wanted to put up a new barn, but
this one's gotta come down first.

08:55.031 --> 08:56.494
Now get back to it, RD.

08:56.796 --> 08:58.664
You got it, boss!

08:59.039 --> 09:00.784
I'd take cover if I were you.

09:26.656 --> 09:29.222
I can't believe I've
wasted all that time.

09:29.223 --> 09:31.057
I should have just come here first.

09:31.058 --> 09:33.849
Fluttershy always has some fear
she's trying to get over.

09:34.049 --> 09:36.964
As a good friend
I'll be able to help her.

09:49.188 --> 09:50.292
Fluttershy?!

09:58.023 --> 09:59.512
How can this be happening?!

09:59.513 --> 10:03.042
Of all the days she had to stop being such
a scaredy-pony she had to pick today?!

10:03.043 --> 10:05.322
What am I going to do?

10:06.193 --> 10:08.534
You really should have
come to me sooner.

10:08.535 --> 10:12.035
You were carrying so much
tension in that shoulder.

10:15.933 --> 10:19.855
It's fine. It'll all be fine.
Today isn't over yet.

10:19.856 --> 10:21.404
But it will be over soon!

10:23.771 --> 10:27.701
It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville,
my advanced studies...

10:27.702 --> 10:31.042
No, no. You're a good student.
You can do this.

10:31.534 --> 10:33.319
Oh! But what if I can't?

10:33.320 --> 10:35.439
You can! You just
have to keep it together.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.192
Keep! It! Together!

10:37.885 --> 10:40.492
Are you talking to... yourself?

10:41.661 --> 10:42.749
Twilight?

10:51.685 --> 10:53.116
SNAP OUT OF IT!

10:53.785 --> 10:54.664
Huh?

10:54.964 --> 10:56.374
Are you okay?

10:59.549 --> 11:01.416
Twilight, I'm really worried.

11:01.417 --> 11:03.703
I mean this letter thing
is really getting to you.

11:03.704 --> 11:04.546
Here.

11:04.547 --> 11:07.848
You've been so anxious all day that
you've completely forgot about the picnic.

11:07.849 --> 11:10.132
Why don't you just relax
and go hang out with...

11:10.133 --> 11:11.225
The picnic!

11:12.142 --> 11:14.155
I should go see my friends!

11:14.156 --> 11:16.474
I'm glad you've come to your senses.

11:25.057 --> 11:28.184
Please tell me I did not forget the plates.

11:28.301 --> 11:30.406
I did! I totally forgot them!

11:30.818 --> 11:33.499
Of all the worst things
that could happen, this is...

11:33.500 --> 11:36.858
The! Worst! Possible! Thing!

11:37.643 --> 11:41.618
Why, why, why!

11:43.730 --> 11:44.692
What?

11:44.693 --> 11:47.347
You didn't expect me to
lay on the grass, did you?

11:56.126 --> 11:57.323
You all right, hun?

11:57.324 --> 11:57.993
NO!

11:57.994 --> 11:59.707
I am not all right.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.902
It's just terrible.

12:04.392 --> 12:05.378
Yes?

12:05.379 --> 12:06.959
Simply awful.

12:07.259 --> 12:08.452
Yes?

12:08.453 --> 12:10.228
It's the most terrific trouble
I've ever been in...

12:10.229 --> 12:13.184
...and I really, really,
really need your help!

12:13.686 --> 12:14.832
YES?

12:14.833 --> 12:17.882
My letter to Princess Celestia
is almost overdue.

12:17.883 --> 12:20.852
And I haven't learned
anything about friendship!

12:22.832 --> 12:26.054
Oh, thank goodness. I thought
something really awful had happened.

12:28.557 --> 12:30.576
Something awful HAS happened!

12:31.491 --> 12:34.770
If I don't turn in the letter
on time, I'll be tardy!

12:35.297 --> 12:37.030
TAAARDY!

12:41.378 --> 12:42.700
No offense, sugar cube...

12:42.701 --> 12:46.247
...but it looks like somepony's gettin'
themselves all worked up over nothin'.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.354
This is not nothing.
This is everything!

12:49.355 --> 12:53.040
I need you guys to help me find somepony
with a problem I can fix before sundown.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.680
MY WHOLE LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!

12:56.451 --> 12:59.237
Oh, Twilight. You're such a crackup.

13:00.677 --> 13:01.829
Come on, now.

13:02.057 --> 13:04.122
Have a seat and stop
sweatin' small stuff.

13:07.930 --> 13:11.263
Wow. I've never seen
Twilight so upset before.

13:11.264 --> 13:14.107
Ugh, what a drama queen.

13:15.438 --> 13:17.331
Relatively speaking.

13:21.507 --> 13:22.795
Clock is ticking, Twilight.

13:23.101 --> 13:25.216
Clock... is... ticking!

13:26.827 --> 13:28.081
Keep it together.

13:28.876 --> 13:31.395
If I can't find a friendship problem...

13:32.194 --> 13:34.283
...I'll *make* a friendship problem!

13:52.902 --> 13:54.754
Hai, gurls!

13:55.732 --> 13:57.982
Oh. Hi, Twilight. How's it goi..

13:57.983 --> 14:00.264
Guh-reat! Just great!

14:00.665 --> 14:02.662
You three look like
you're doing great too!

14:02.663 --> 14:04.358
Looks like three good
friends who obviously...

14:04.359 --> 14:07.483
...don't need the help
of another good friend!

14:09.066 --> 14:11.129
This is Smarty Pants.

14:11.130 --> 14:12.954
She was mine when I was your age.

14:12.955 --> 14:15.358
And now I want to give her to you!

14:17.019 --> 14:19.640
Uh... She's... great!

14:19.641 --> 14:22.197
Yeah... Great.

14:22.198 --> 14:26.403
I really like her... mane?

14:26.404 --> 14:29.922
She even comes with
her own notebook and quill.

14:29.923 --> 14:33.216
For when you want to pretend
she's doing her homework.

14:33.889 --> 14:37.018
That's, um... great.

14:37.019 --> 14:39.707
Yeah... Great.

14:41.211 --> 14:44.518
I really like her... mane?

14:44.618 --> 14:47.037
I just hope the fact that
there are three of you...

14:47.038 --> 14:49.798
...and only one of her
doesn't become a problem.

14:49.799 --> 14:53.215
I'd hate to cause a rift
between such good friends!

14:54.446 --> 14:56.126
So who wants to play with her first?

14:56.681 --> 14:59.057
Uh... You should play
with her first, Sweetie Belle.

14:59.058 --> 15:01.414
You know, cause you
like her mane so much.

15:01.806 --> 15:03.138
Nononononono.

15:03.139 --> 15:06.449
I think Scootaloo should
get to play with her first.

15:06.450 --> 15:09.606
I'd love to, but, um...
You take her, Apple Bloom.

15:10.498 --> 15:13.166
Applejack says it's important to share.

15:14.057 --> 15:16.715
I got to think of something.
Thinkthinkthink, Twilight, think!

15:17.350 --> 15:18.530
That's it!

15:18.982 --> 15:21.692
Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants.

15:21.693 --> 15:24.322
And you're going to like her
more than anything.

15:33.219 --> 15:34.603
I want it.

15:34.604 --> 15:36.536
I need it.

15:36.537 --> 15:38.798
I really like her mane!

15:41.502 --> 15:44.268
The "want it, need it" spell.
Works every time.

15:44.632 --> 15:46.736
Okay, okay. Let's break it up.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.275
I think you can all see that
there is an important lesson...

15:49.276 --> 15:50.743
...to be learned here about...

15:52.273 --> 15:54.825
Come on, girls. We're all friends here, right?

15:54.929 --> 15:56.564
Don't you think you have to share?

15:57.398 --> 15:58.640
No way!

16:05.374 --> 16:07.620
Big McIntosh! Thank goodness!

16:07.621 --> 16:10.561
You gotta help me get that
doll away from those girls.

16:10.785 --> 16:12.477
Eeyup.

16:19.430 --> 16:23.250
Thank you so much. Now if
you could just give her to me...

16:23.761 --> 16:25.136
Nnnope.

16:26.427 --> 16:27.516
Oh no!

16:32.038 --> 16:33.508
What's all the commotion about?

16:33.509 --> 16:35.100
They're fighting over that doll!

16:35.101 --> 16:38.031
That incredible, amazing doll!

16:40.005 --> 16:42.773
Can't get a clear shot...

16:47.701 --> 16:48.744
Give me!

16:53.152 --> 16:54.457
Nnnope.

16:56.150 --> 16:57.840
Oh, what have I done?!

17:04.361 --> 17:05.754
Y'all hear that?

17:08.556 --> 17:12.304
What in the name of all things
oats 'n apples is goin' on here?

17:19.965 --> 17:22.447
-DON'T LOOK AT IT!
-Don't look at what?

17:22.448 --> 17:23.935
My Smarty Pants doll.

17:23.936 --> 17:27.025
I enchanted her and now
everypony is fighting over her.

17:27.721 --> 17:29.909
Why would you enchant your doll?

17:29.910 --> 17:31.289
Oh, I had to do something!

17:31.290 --> 17:33.491
I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia.

17:33.492 --> 17:36.851
I thought if I couldn't find
a problem, I'd make a problem.

17:36.852 --> 17:38.782
The day is almost over!

17:39.141 --> 17:40.585
Not almost.

17:46.889 --> 17:48.753
Twilight Sparkle!

17:51.763 --> 17:53.522
Whoa, Nelly.

18:23.318 --> 18:25.686
Meet me in the library.

18:27.751 --> 18:30.899
Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit...

18:31.398 --> 18:35.434
...I'll be in magic kindergarten
back in Canterlot.

18:37.181 --> 18:40.071
-Magic kindergarten?
-Canterlot?

18:40.857 --> 18:43.411
We're never gonna see Twilight again!

18:43.928 --> 18:45.802
What are we gonna do, y'all?

18:45.841 --> 18:48.551
Of all the worst things
that could happen...

18:48.746 --> 18:52.810
...this is the! Worst! Possible! Thing!

18:56.520 --> 18:59.418
What? I really mean it this time.

19:00.667 --> 19:05.051
But... But... I'm supposed to send you
a letter about friendship every week.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.589
I missed the deadline.

19:06.590 --> 19:10.275
I'm a bad student. I'm tardy!

19:10.396 --> 19:12.972
You are a wonderful student, Twilight.

19:12.973 --> 19:15.781
I don't have to get a letter
every week to know that.

19:16.185 --> 19:17.197
Really?

19:19.797 --> 19:20.534
WAIT!

19:20.535 --> 19:21.858
You can't punish her!

19:21.859 --> 19:23.255
It wasn't her fault!

19:23.256 --> 19:24.466
I'm listening.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.206
Please, your highness.
We all saw that Twilight was upset.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.362
But we thought that the thing
she was worrying about...

19:29.363 --> 19:31.235
...wasn't worth worrying about.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.129
So when she ran out all worked up...

19:33.130 --> 19:35.373
...not a single one of us
tried to stop her.

19:35.374 --> 19:37.923
As Twilight's good friends,
we should have taken...

19:37.924 --> 19:40.596
...her feelings seriously
and been there for her.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.409
Please don't take her away from us...

19:42.410 --> 19:45.217
...just because we were
too insensitive to help her.

19:47.759 --> 19:51.010
Looks like you all learned
a pretty valuable lesson today.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.256
Very well. I'll forget Twilight's
punishment on one condition.

20:01.131 --> 20:03.005
From this day forth
I would like you all...

20:03.006 --> 20:06.163
...to report to me your findings
on the magic of friendship.

20:06.164 --> 20:09.214
When and only when you happen to discover them.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.220
Princess Celestia! Wait!

20:15.221 --> 20:17.242
How did you know I was in trouble?

20:17.342 --> 20:18.864
Your friend Spike made me aware...

20:18.865 --> 20:21.243
...that you were letting
your fears get the best of you.

20:21.244 --> 20:24.311
I commend him for taking
your feelings seriously.

20:24.538 --> 20:28.189
Now, if you will all excuse me,
I must return to Canterlot.

20:28.609 --> 20:30.635
I'm expecting some mail.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.211
Y'all heard the princess.
Spike, take a letter.

20:44.525 --> 20:47.256
"Dear Princess Celestia.
We're writin' to you..."

20:47.257 --> 20:50.178
"...because today we all learned
a little somethin' about friendship."

20:50.179 --> 20:53.374
"We learned that you should take
your friends' worries seriously."

20:53.375 --> 20:56.414
"Even if you don't think that
she has anything to worry about."

20:56.415 --> 20:59.658
"And that you shouldn't let
your worries turn a small problem..."

20:59.659 --> 21:02.919
"...into an enormously huge
entire-town-in-total-chaos..."

21:02.920 --> 21:05.639
"...Princess-has-to-come-
-and-save-the-day problem."

21:05.640 --> 21:08.476
"Signed, your loyal subjects."

21:09.889 --> 21:12.839
"PS. Obviously Spike did not
have to learn a lesson..."

21:12.840 --> 21:16.234
"...because he is the best, most
awesome friend a pony could ask for."

21:16.235 --> 21:19.623
"Unlike everypony else,
he took things seriously. And..."

21:21.964 --> 21:23.466
Uh... Yeah.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.050
I'll just, um...

21:33.101 --> 21:36.601
