00:12.960 --> 00:15.905
"And that's when the yellow birdie
thought to himself:"

00:16.187 --> 00:20.438
"Hm... My favorite little tree
isn't such a little tree anymore."

00:20.460 --> 00:23.359
"So she sang her song, big and strong."

00:23.360 --> 00:28.004
"And they all lived in that great,
big tree happily ever after."

00:28.104 --> 00:29.966
The End.

00:31.378 --> 00:32.284
Applejack!

00:32.839 --> 00:34.913
Were you reading a bedtime story to...

00:35.081 --> 00:36.708
...an apple tree?

00:39.766 --> 00:44.506
Well, you know, bein' replanted in a whole
new place is very upsettin' for a tree.

00:44.507 --> 00:46.713
And Bloomberg here is one of my favorites.

00:47.921 --> 00:49.734
No fair, Applejack!

00:49.735 --> 00:52.903
You've got a luxurious private
sleeper cart for a TREE...!

00:52.904 --> 00:56.675
...while I am crowded and cramped
in a same cart with all the other ponies.

00:56.676 --> 00:59.274
How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?

00:59.436 --> 01:02.218
But Bloomberg's the whole
reason we're makin' this trip.

01:02.219 --> 01:06.285
He needs his rest so we can give him
as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.

01:07.035 --> 01:09.678
You talk about it as if
it's your baby or something.

01:09.679 --> 01:12.622
Who you callin' a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby!

01:13.141 --> 01:16.048
Don't wet wittle Rarity make you all saddie-waddie.

01:16.049 --> 01:18.459
Bloomber's a big and strong apple tree.

01:18.460 --> 01:21.516
Yes, he is. A coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo.

01:21.517 --> 01:24.758
It's widdle Rarity, who's all saddie-waddie.

02:19.970 --> 02:21.789
For crying out loud in the morning!

02:24.518 --> 02:25.967
Do you guys mind?

02:25.968 --> 02:29.808
I was up early fire-roasting those snacks
you're all eating and I pooped!

02:30.439 --> 02:33.476
Speaking of, somebody's popcorn kernels didn't get popped.

02:33.997 --> 02:35.476
Okay, fine.

02:40.028 --> 02:41.111
Goodnight.

02:43.112 --> 02:45.847
Maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye.

02:45.848 --> 02:48.252
We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.

02:54.607 --> 02:56.427
Psst...! Pinkie Pie!

02:56.929 --> 02:58.003
You asleep yet?

02:58.419 --> 03:00.168
No. Are you asleep yet?

03:00.652 --> 03:04.043
If I was sleeping, how could I
have asked you if you were asleep?

03:04.044 --> 03:05.444
Oh yeah!

03:05.951 --> 03:09.335
When we get to Appleloosa, you think
we'll have to carry that heavy tree...

03:09.336 --> 03:10.931
...all the way from the train to the orchard?

03:10.932 --> 03:12.823
What tree? You mean Bloomberg?

03:13.003 --> 03:14.942
No. Fluttershy.

03:14.943 --> 03:16.894
Fluttershy's not a tree, silly.

03:17.151 --> 03:18.283
What's going on?

03:18.284 --> 03:20.613
Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy is a tree.

03:20.614 --> 03:22.235
I do NOT think she's a tree. I was just...

03:22.236 --> 03:23.921
Did you say she was a tree?

03:23.922 --> 03:26.329
No! Well... yes. But not exactly...

03:26.330 --> 03:28.454
You know she's not a tree, right?

03:28.455 --> 03:30.421
She's not a tree, Dashie.

03:30.580 --> 03:32.076
I'd like to be a tree.

03:32.077 --> 03:33.633
Oh, for Pete's sake!

03:38.993 --> 03:40.741
Well, that was kinda huffy.

03:40.841 --> 03:42.720
Huffy the Magic Dragon.

03:46.525 --> 03:49.212
Could you all be quiet NOW?!

03:53.351 --> 03:54.137
Bloomberg?

03:55.305 --> 03:56.428
Bloomberg!

03:58.607 --> 04:00.608
Sorry, but I tend to snore a bit.

04:00.721 --> 04:01.726
Goodnight.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.625
A buffalo stampede!

04:23.937 --> 04:26.539
I just love their accessories.

04:27.187 --> 04:29.416
They're getting awfully close to the train.

04:56.832 --> 04:57.848
Ooh, looky!

04:57.849 --> 04:59.397
Now they're going tricks!

05:06.711 --> 05:08.625
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Now do a backflip!

05:11.263 --> 05:12.758
Or... just jump?

05:14.489 --> 05:15.274
Hm...

05:15.275 --> 05:18.201
Something tells me this isn't a circus act.

05:20.092 --> 05:22.251
Hey there! Where are you headed in such a hurry?

05:27.956 --> 05:30.176
Wow. You're pretty quick for someone so...

05:30.326 --> 05:32.182
...bulky. No offense.

05:35.709 --> 05:36.784
I just wanna know...

05:38.031 --> 05:38.607
Hey!

05:40.535 --> 05:41.683
I'm talking to you!

05:44.989 --> 05:45.883
Wow...

05:50.246 --> 05:51.614
I've got you now...

06:11.722 --> 06:13.790
They've got Bloomberg!

06:15.669 --> 06:17.255
Help!

06:17.516 --> 06:18.787
And Spike!

06:23.771 --> 06:26.451
Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her.

06:38.223 --> 06:38.962
Hey there!

06:38.963 --> 06:41.251
Welcome to AAAPPLELOOSA!

06:41.332 --> 06:42.462
Braeburn, listen...

06:42.463 --> 06:44.899
Hey, cousin Applejack. Mind your manners.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.362
You have yet to introduce me
to your compadres. Shame on you.

06:48.445 --> 06:50.504
Braeburn, listen. Somth'n terrible's happened...

06:50.505 --> 06:53.565
Terrible is right. Your train is full seven minutes late.

06:53.566 --> 06:57.288
That's seven minutes less for you to
delight in the pleasures and wonders of...

06:57.289 --> 06:59.159
AAAPPLELOOSA!

07:01.937 --> 07:05.896
Boggles the mind, we settler ponies built
all this in just a past year, don't it?

07:05.897 --> 07:08.511
And as you can see, we have all of the finest comforts.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.280
Like horse-drawn carriages.

07:10.367 --> 07:12.172
Okay, you pull now.

07:12.173 --> 07:13.780
Eh, we just switched.

07:13.781 --> 07:16.614
And now's there horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages.

07:20.429 --> 07:21.784
Listen, Braeburn, I...

07:22.224 --> 07:25.860
And here's our local waterin' hole:
The Salt Block.

07:25.954 --> 07:27.236
That's enough salt for you!

07:28.414 --> 07:31.506
Can't I at least get a glass of water?

07:35.074 --> 07:37.317
Over there is the office of Sheriff Silverstar.

07:38.463 --> 07:40.839
And here's where we have our wild west dances.

07:41.133 --> 07:43.464
And here's where we have our mild west dances.

07:43.608 --> 07:44.989
But Braeburn, we...

07:45.026 --> 07:48.484
And here is the most wonderful sight in all of...

07:48.485 --> 07:50.430
AAAPPLELOOSA!

07:50.631 --> 07:52.557
Our apple orchard.

07:53.407 --> 07:53.884
Braeburn!

07:53.885 --> 07:55.530
First harvest should be any day now.

07:55.531 --> 07:56.762
-Braebu...
-Good thing too.

07:56.763 --> 07:58.485
-Brae...
-Cause we need that grub to live on.

07:58.576 --> 07:59.671
BRAEBURN!!!

07:59.707 --> 08:01.326
Uh... yes, cous?

08:02.136 --> 08:06.443
You have a very nice town n' all
but we have a huuuge problem.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.211
Some of our friends are missin'.

08:08.212 --> 08:10.709
-A stampede of buffalo!
-The took Spike!

08:10.710 --> 08:13.660
-Rainbow Dash went after them!
-And we can't find Pinkie Pie!

08:13.661 --> 08:17.584
And we had an apple tree with us
for your orchard, but they took that too.

08:18.093 --> 08:19.810
Did you say buffalo?

08:22.679 --> 08:27.899
Dem buffalo, they want us settler ponies to take
every single tree you see here off this land.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.219
They sure as hay don't want any new ones added in.

08:30.220 --> 08:31.502
But why?

08:31.680 --> 08:32.527
Beats me.

08:32.528 --> 08:37.405
We put a lotta hard work into this land so we
could feed our town, our families, our foals.

08:37.406 --> 08:39.919
And now they're sayin' all these trees have to go?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.012
T'ain't fair.

08:53.254 --> 08:55.923
Oh, I can't wait to get my hooves
on that little buffalo.

08:57.861 --> 09:00.224
Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it.

09:00.225 --> 09:00.916
Boo!

09:02.622 --> 09:03.642
Pinkie Pie!

09:03.768 --> 09:06.997
Ah, you caught me! Looks like I tricked you
and didn't get away with it either.

09:06.998 --> 09:08.192
You're good.

09:08.193 --> 09:11.594
Shh! What do you think you're doing?
You gotta get outta here.

09:11.595 --> 09:12.719
I do?

09:12.949 --> 09:14.366
You're gonna blow my cover!

09:14.367 --> 09:15.399
I am?

09:15.638 --> 09:19.109
-I'm trying to save Spike!
-OH MY GOSH! So am I!

09:19.110 --> 09:22.535
And the more of us there are out here,
the more chance is of us getting...

09:24.431 --> 09:25.298
...caught.

09:26.130 --> 09:29.092
Run, Pinkie. I'll hold them off. Save yourself!

09:30.323 --> 09:31.295
STOP!!!

09:34.049 --> 09:36.045
Dash, Pinkie, 'sup?

09:36.046 --> 09:38.128
Hey, no worries, I know those guys.

09:38.129 --> 09:38.957
They're cool.

09:38.958 --> 09:41.490
If you say so, Spike. Catch ya later, bro.

09:50.818 --> 09:52.831
Seems they took me by mistake.

09:52.832 --> 09:55.036
And they feel awful about it too, poor guys.

09:55.037 --> 09:57.663
Fortunately, they totally respect dragons...

09:57.664 --> 09:59.815
...so they treat me like an honored guest.

10:00.047 --> 10:03.282
Still don't like ponies much though,
but you're with me, so it's cool.

10:03.283 --> 10:05.643
Huh. Why, I still don't trust them.

10:05.644 --> 10:07.750
I say we turn tail and bail while we still...

10:09.073 --> 10:12.678
Before we finish eating?
Are you a loco in the coco?

10:15.512 --> 10:18.109
Can I please have more of that
mushy stuff, whatever it was?

10:18.110 --> 10:21.789
Certainly. And, Mr. Spike,
you like gemstones, yes?

10:21.790 --> 10:23.462
Turquoise, mmm...

10:24.706 --> 10:26.079
This here's Little Strongheart.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.924
And these are my friends,
Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash.

10:30.615 --> 10:31.361
You!

10:31.526 --> 10:32.361
You!

10:32.467 --> 10:35.346
That's it! We are outta here.

10:37.515 --> 10:38.286
Wait!

10:38.287 --> 10:41.436
Please, accept my apologies
for what happened on the train.

10:41.437 --> 10:43.510
We didn't mean for anyone to be hurt.

10:43.822 --> 10:44.964
Yeah, right.

10:45.915 --> 10:47.478
We only wanted the tree.

10:47.479 --> 10:51.840
The settler ponies have overtaken the land
and have planted an orchard all over it.

10:51.841 --> 10:57.358
Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer
run over our traditional stampeding grounds.

10:57.359 --> 10:58.271
Huh?

10:58.495 --> 11:01.061
I think it's time they've met Chief Thunderhooves.

11:03.873 --> 11:07.360
We have a long and winding stampeding trail...

11:07.361 --> 11:10.268
...which we run upon for many generations.

11:10.269 --> 11:14.563
My father stampeded upon these grounds...

11:14.663 --> 11:17.039
...and his father before him...

11:17.114 --> 11:19.918
...and his father before him...

11:20.296 --> 11:23.116
...and his father before him...

11:23.279 --> 11:25.939
...and his father before him...

11:26.231 --> 11:29.268
-...and...
-I think they get the idea, Chief.

11:30.112 --> 11:34.638
It is a sacred tradition to run the path every year.

11:34.639 --> 11:39.272
But these year, these settler ponies, these...

11:40.211 --> 11:43.031
Appleloosans!

11:45.671 --> 11:49.500
They planted apple trees all over it
without asking our permission.

11:49.798 --> 11:52.417
Well, that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?

11:53.747 --> 11:56.056
The ponies refused to move their trees...

11:56.057 --> 11:59.097
...so we are stuck here and it is not fair!

12:00.420 --> 12:02.919
See, Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason to...

12:06.497 --> 12:08.107
I'll say they had a good reason!

12:08.404 --> 12:12.509
Come on! We have some apple-picking
Appleloosans to talk to!

12:19.664 --> 12:21.392
Gently, please.

12:21.599 --> 12:23.614
Sorry, Rarity. But our friends are out there...

12:23.615 --> 12:27.233
...and we have to be ready for a long hike
into buffalo territory if we're gonna save them.

12:27.433 --> 12:28.580
Let's go!

12:33.016 --> 12:34.012
Hi, guys!

12:34.013 --> 12:34.916
Pinkie!

12:35.751 --> 12:37.565
We're so glad you're safe.

12:40.380 --> 12:42.226
How did you escape from the buffalo?

12:42.310 --> 12:43.387
We didn't.

12:45.076 --> 12:47.519
We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.

12:47.898 --> 12:49.878
Oh yeah? 'bout what?

12:49.909 --> 12:53.353
We brought our new pal Little Strongheart
here to explain to the Appleloosans...

12:53.354 --> 12:56.245
...why they should move
the apple trees off buffalo land.

12:56.246 --> 12:57.582
That information would be quite help...

12:57.583 --> 13:01.201
That's weird. Cause my cousin Braeburn
here wants to explain to the buffalo...

13:01.202 --> 13:03.340
...why they should let the apple trees stay.

13:03.341 --> 13:05.270
That would a useful thing to...

13:05.271 --> 13:06.457
The land is theirs!

13:06.458 --> 13:09.453
You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake.

13:09.454 --> 13:11.651
Now you just gotta move 'em, that's all.

13:11.851 --> 13:13.104
Well, heh...

13:13.105 --> 13:16.733
They busted their rumps here! And now
they're supposed to bust their rumps again...

13:16.734 --> 13:19.397
...just cause some buffalo
won't stampede someplace else?

13:19.650 --> 13:21.214
Plant the trees somewhere else.

13:21.215 --> 13:22.275
Where?

13:22.276 --> 13:24.728
It's the only flat land around these parts.

13:24.729 --> 13:26.573
The buffalo had it FIRST!

13:26.574 --> 13:29.286
The settler ponies need it to LIVE!

13:31.971 --> 13:32.748
Look!

13:32.848 --> 13:36.630
Both the settlers and the buffalo
have good reasons to use this land.

13:36.830 --> 13:38.958
There must be something we can do.

13:39.131 --> 13:40.876
Hey! I've got an idea!

13:58.616 --> 14:03.415
<i>We may be divided
But of you all I beg</i>

14:03.416 --> 14:09.523
<i>To remember we're all hoofed
At the end of each leg</i>

14:11.701 --> 14:15.264
<i>No matter what the issue
Come from wherever you please</i>

14:15.265 --> 14:18.849
<i>All this fighting gets you nothing
But hoof-and-mouth disease</i>

14:19.089 --> 14:22.169
<i>Arguing's not the way
Hey, come out and play!</i>

14:22.170 --> 14:25.604
<i>It's a shiny new day
So what do you say?</i>

14:25.605 --> 14:29.157
<i>You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare</i>

14:29.158 --> 14:30.895
<i>It's a right thing to do</i>

14:30.896 --> 14:34.468
<i>You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare</i>

14:34.469 --> 14:37.630
<i>And there'll always be a way through!</i>

14:38.019 --> 14:41.486
<i>Both our diets, I should mention
Are completely vegetarian</i>

14:41.487 --> 14:44.623
<i>We all eat hay and oats
Why be at each other's throat?</i>

14:44.624 --> 14:48.259
<i>You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare</i>

14:48.260 --> 14:49.652
<i>It's a right thing to do</i>

14:49.653 --> 14:56.760
<i>And there'll always be a way throoough!</i>

15:00.684 --> 15:05.255
Alright, Pinkie Pie, that was FANTASTIC!
What a great song, you're right on!

15:08.694 --> 15:12.438
It appears that Sheriff Silverstar
and I have come to...

15:12.603 --> 15:13.651
...an agreement.

15:13.652 --> 15:14.696
We have.

15:17.739 --> 15:19.799
That was the worst performance we've ever seen.

15:20.477 --> 15:21.491
Absotively.

15:21.708 --> 15:24.953
The time for action is upon us.

15:24.954 --> 15:28.687
Our stampede will start at high noon tomorrow.

15:28.688 --> 15:31.811
And if the orchard is still there...

15:31.812 --> 15:33.630
...we'll flatten it!

15:33.631 --> 15:36.094
And the whole town!

15:37.188 --> 15:38.389
But Chief...!

15:38.390 --> 15:42.087
And we Appleloosans say you
better bring your best...

15:42.088 --> 15:44.355
...cause we'll be ready and waitin'!

15:44.356 --> 15:45.594
But Sheriff...!

15:50.765 --> 15:53.938
Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all.

16:00.613 --> 16:02.972
I want my kin to have what they need to live...

16:02.973 --> 16:06.622
...but a storm's a-brewin' here.
And I don't like the look of it.

16:06.623 --> 16:10.228
We've just got to talk some sense into them
before somepony gets hurt.

16:11.035 --> 16:13.738
Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we...

16:16.985 --> 16:19.028
About the trees, now if you just...

16:35.771 --> 16:37.896
If we could just sit down and talk, we could...

16:42.345 --> 16:45.418
Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!

16:56.441 --> 16:58.043
Sheriff! If we could only...

17:28.365 --> 17:30.414
Isn't there some way to stop this?

17:30.415 --> 17:32.835
Unless the settlers remove those trees...

17:33.027 --> 17:34.602
...I do not think so.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.488
I know you don't wanna do this.

17:40.489 --> 17:42.102
But they have taken our land.

17:43.039 --> 17:46.272
What would you have me do, Rainbow Dash?

17:46.561 --> 17:49.898
I don't know. But it's never too late
to think of something.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.483
At noon it will be too late.

18:10.918 --> 18:12.592
Come on! Think!

18:12.593 --> 18:15.148
Thinkthinkthinkthinkthinkthinkthink!

18:43.599 --> 18:45.082
He's not gonna do it!

18:45.903 --> 18:49.417
<i>You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare</i>

18:49.418 --> 18:51.292
<i>It's a right thing to do</i>

18:51.293 --> 18:52.006
<i>You gotta shaaare...</i>

18:52.007 --> 18:54.920
CHAAARGE!

19:06.589 --> 19:07.438
Ready?

19:08.251 --> 19:08.895
Aim...

19:10.087 --> 19:11.512
FIRE!

20:31.157 --> 20:32.310
Yum!

20:32.718 --> 20:36.056
Hey! I've got a much better idea!

20:46.931 --> 20:52.972
We will allow the apple orchard to stay
in exchange for a share of its fruit.

20:53.777 --> 20:56.985
Those... delicious apple pies.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.218
I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week.

21:05.678 --> 21:07.895
Bloomberg, this is your special day.

21:07.896 --> 21:09.692
Mama's so proud of you.

21:17.265 --> 21:19.051
"Dear Princess Celestia."

21:19.052 --> 21:21.719
"Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing."

21:22.017 --> 21:24.542
"Even the worst of enemies can become friends."

21:24.742 --> 21:27.228
"You need understanding and compromise."

21:27.229 --> 21:30.081
"You've got to share. You've got to care."

21:30.181 --> 21:32.344
Hey! That's what I said!

21:34.194 --> 21:37.694
