11:33.440 --> 11:34.780
[poof!]

11:37.340 --> 11:42.280
Hmmmmm. That's one sweet
party cannon you got there.

11:42.580 --> 11:45.120
Tell you what. I'd be more
than happy to give you

11:45.160 --> 11:48.380
the pouch for the low, low
price of... that cannon.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.080
My, my party cannon?

11:53.420 --> 11:56.040
Well, if you really want to
give that sister of yours

11:56.080 --> 11:57.540
the perfect present,

11:57.760 --> 11:59.860
then you'll have to give
up your party cannon.

12:00.920 --> 12:05.360
So what do you say? The
pouch for the cannon.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.500
Do you see the exposed
chalcedony in the fissure?

12:15.620 --> 12:16.460
Probably?

12:16.880 --> 12:18.100
Whatcha guys looking at?

12:18.340 --> 12:19.600
Oh, you're back.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.420
Darling, I want to get
one more picture of you

12:22.480 --> 12:24.580
and that astounding
fissure in the sidewalk.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.680
And the inspiration
just struck me

12:26.740 --> 12:28.060
for the perfect shot!

12:28.100 --> 12:30.960
Be a dear and go
stand behind it.

12:33.460 --> 12:36.160
OK, now just back
up a little bit.

12:38.220 --> 12:38.960
Little more.

12:41.140 --> 12:44.490
And now just a little...
twenty yards more.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.080
Perfect! Hold that pose!

12:48.220 --> 12:50.880
I think we found your
new holiday card!

12:51.620 --> 12:54.180
So, how did it go? Tell
me, tell me, tell me!

12:54.500 --> 12:57.100
Well, I got the
rock pouch for Maud.

12:57.620 --> 12:59.420
That's really the only
thing that matters.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.340
Oh, I am so glad
to hear that!

13:02.400 --> 13:04.200
She's going to
absolutely LOVE it.

13:05.260 --> 13:05.940
Yep.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.440
Yep? That's it?

13:08.800 --> 13:11.540
You got your sister the
greatest PSSSD present

13:11.560 --> 13:12.580
in the history of ever

13:12.720 --> 13:14.900
and all you have
to say is 'yep'?

13:15.380 --> 13:15.880
Yep.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.440
But you're Pinkie Pie.
You're supposed to be all--

13:19.680 --> 13:21.640
I'm so excited I
got the rock pouch!

13:21.840 --> 13:23.120
And I know I say
'excited' a lot

13:23.160 --> 13:25.220
when I'm actually just kind
of excited, but this time

13:25.240 --> 13:27.480
I'm really excited about how
excited I am about being

13:27.520 --> 13:28.700
this excited over
the rock pouch!

13:28.960 --> 13:30.360
And then you fire off
your party cannon.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.940
Say, where is your cannon?

13:34.320 --> 13:35.140
[gasp] Did you lose it?

13:35.380 --> 13:37.780
Is your party cannon lost
somewhere in the big city?

13:38.100 --> 13:40.360
Well, I wouldn't say it's lost.

13:40.540 --> 13:44.020
I mean, I know where it
is, it's just... [sigh]

13:44.720 --> 13:46.980
I can clearly see that
something's bothering you

13:47.040 --> 13:48.320
and I want to help.
But I can't help you

13:48.820 --> 13:51.600
unless you tell me
what the problem is.

13:52.020 --> 13:54.200
Oh there's no problem.
It just turns out

13:54.220 --> 13:56.420
that the going rate for a
rock pouch in Manehattan

13:56.500 --> 13:58.820
is one party cannon. Who knew?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.760
YOU GAVE AWAY YOUR CANNON?

14:02.180 --> 14:04.680
B-but that party cannon
is your everything!

14:04.960 --> 14:06.360
You absolutely
love that cannon.

14:06.420 --> 14:07.680
How could you possibly
part with something

14:07.680 --> 14:09.020
that means so much to you?

14:09.880 --> 14:11.840
Well, I finally got Maud a gift

14:11.880 --> 14:14.220
that's just as good as the
ones she always gets me.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.580
And that's all that
really matters.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.080
Well, I guess I
understand. Maybe?

14:20.600 --> 14:22.500
Maud's going to be so excited.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.280
I can't wait to see
the look on her face

14:24.320 --> 14:25.720
when she sees the pouch!

14:27.280 --> 14:29.840
I know. The camera
loves Boulder.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.020
After the day we've had,

14:34.200 --> 14:36.260
I'm probably looking
forward to the "swap" part

14:36.320 --> 14:37.860
of the Pie Sister
Surprise Swap Day

14:37.920 --> 14:39.300
even more than the
two of you!

14:40.120 --> 14:42.020
And I'm not even
a Pie sister!

14:42.420 --> 14:44.360
I can't wait one
more second to see

14:44.400 --> 14:46.260
the wonderful gifts
you've gotten each other.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.760
Well, you're going have to.
We don't just swap, silly.

14:49.860 --> 14:53.420
We always sing the Pie Sister
Surprise Swap Day Song first.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.520
Ready, Maud?

14:54.840 --> 14:56.020
As I'll ever be.

14:56.580 --> 15:00.080

15:27.440 --> 15:30.260
It was all worth it!
Look how happy she is!

15:32.100 --> 15:33.840
And I couldn't have
done it without you.

15:34.140 --> 15:35.080
Thank you, Rarity.

15:35.700 --> 15:38.620
OK, time to open
your present to me!

15:41.140 --> 15:42.880
Uh! You did it again!

15:43.060 --> 15:46.260
You got me the best present
in the history of PSSSD!

15:46.680 --> 15:49.740
This is perfect. This is
amazing. This is incredible!

15:49.840 --> 15:51.600
I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!

15:53.100 --> 15:53.800
What is it?

15:54.440 --> 15:56.840
It's little pieces of
cupcake-scented paper.

15:57.300 --> 16:00.280
You know. Confetti.
For your cannon.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.840
Maud, you know me so well.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.240
You really are the most
thoughtful gift-giver

16:06.300 --> 16:07.080
in the world.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.600
I'm going to love it five-ever.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.060
That's even longer than forever.

16:17.180 --> 16:17.920
You're right.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.180
That is impressive, but it's
no fissure in the sidewalk.

16:22.920 --> 16:23.820
Play nice.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.720
Oh, I'm so relieved to see that
you like the pouch. Especially

16:26.900 --> 16:29.460
considering what Pinkie
Pie had to give up for it.

16:29.680 --> 16:30.680
[gasp]

16:31.080 --> 16:31.780
What?

16:31.920 --> 16:33.340
I mean, forget I said that.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.360
I'm-I'm glad to
see you like pouch.

16:36.420 --> 16:39.340
You can remember that part.
Just forget the second part.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.820
You know, the second part
where I said Pinkie Pie

16:41.860 --> 16:43.760
had to give something
up for it. [gasp]

16:43.980 --> 16:46.040
I should just stop
talking now. Nothing!

16:46.680 --> 16:48.040
Hee-hee! Yay!

16:48.120 --> 16:50.700
I love my sister
and my new confetti!

16:51.840 --> 16:53.840
Why isn't she using
her party cannon?

16:54.200 --> 16:55.240
Uh.

16:58.760 --> 17:02.280
Ooh wow, look how
filthy my hooves are.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.240
I really should go
wash them.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.460
Where's her cannon?

17:07.940 --> 17:11.220
No, no stop giving me that
look! I can't take it.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.960
Pinkie Pie feels badly that
the gifts she always gives you

17:16.000 --> 17:17.840
are never as good as
the ones you give her.

17:18.380 --> 17:19.040
What?

17:19.220 --> 17:20.720
That's why she was
willing to give up

17:20.760 --> 17:22.240
her party cannon
for the pouch.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.500
She gave up her party cannon?

17:28.520 --> 17:33.300
Pinkie Pie? You might want to
come over here for a second.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.580
I think I know
what this is about.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.580
You guys want to
ride the swans.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.400
Well, they're swan boats,

17:40.440 --> 17:42.860
but there are real
swans here we can ride.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.040
You gave away your
party cannon?

17:47.280 --> 17:48.300
She broke me.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.500
It's just... it's just...

17:54.020 --> 17:55.900
You always give
better gifts than me!

17:56.460 --> 17:59.040
That's why I had to get
you the perfect gift.

18:02.300 --> 18:05.180
Are your hooves
dirty? Where ya going?

18:05.760 --> 18:07.260

18:20.720 --> 18:23.720
That's amazing! How did
you know where he'd be?

18:24.140 --> 18:25.000
Maud sense.

18:26.180 --> 18:27.260
Runs in the family.

18:30.740 --> 18:32.180

return this pouch

18:32.200 --> 18:34.100

party cannon, please.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.000
Sorry, missy. All
sales are final.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.240
I'd like to
return this pouch

18:39.320 --> 18:42.260
for my sister's
party cannon, please.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.680
I've never seen
her like this.

18:44.980 --> 18:46.900
Look at the fire
in her eyes.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.620
You better do
what she says.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.340
Fire in her eyes?

18:50.560 --> 18:52.480
Oh, did she just
clench her jaw?

18:52.580 --> 18:54.340
I think she
clenched her jaw.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.300
I didn't see.

18:56.820 --> 19:02.100
Oh, no. When she clenches her
jaw, you know what that means?

19:02.120 --> 19:03.540
What? What's it mean?

19:03.980 --> 19:06.800
Trust me; you do
not want to know.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.160
I'd like to return
this pouch.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.240

19:11.320 --> 19:13.600
Here! Take it!
Take it! Please!

19:13.860 --> 19:15.340
Just relax that
jaw of yours!

19:15.380 --> 19:17.740

fire in your eyes!

Uh-oh. I just
realized something.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.100
Because you gave back
the pouch for my cannon,

19:33.220 --> 19:35.580
this is now the second gift
you've gotten me today!

19:35.780 --> 19:38.320
And it's something I
really, really wanted!

19:38.380 --> 19:41.460
You did it again! Your gifts
are always better than mine!

19:41.760 --> 19:44.740
Next year, I'm going to have
to really step it up and-

19:45.000 --> 19:47.640
Pinkie, gift-giving
isn't a competition.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.280
It's an expression
of love.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.160
And you always make
sure to give your gifts

19:51.180 --> 19:52.400
with lots of love.

19:53.020 --> 19:56.460
That's why I'll always love
them and you, five-ever.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.440
That's even longer

20:03.340 --> 20:05.980
There you are. You've sure
been washing your hooves

20:06.000 --> 20:08.820
for a long time. We've
got a train to catch here.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.440
I know, but there
is one more sight

see before we leave.

What do you think
of the place?

Did I pick a good spot?

20:29.660 --> 20:33.160
No. You picked the perfect spot.

But, now that you mention it,

21:23.920 --> 21:26.140
I could use more confetti

how much of that stuff
