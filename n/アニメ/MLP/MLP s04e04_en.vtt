00:13.463 --> 00:14.419
Four more months.

00:14.437 --> 00:15.295
Four more months.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.302
Four more months.

00:16.651 --> 00:17.914
I bet you're excited, huh?

00:18.044 --> 00:20.222
Oh, my, I uh...

00:20.366 --> 00:21.459
I could be excited.

00:21.518 --> 00:22.454
I don't really know.

00:22.544 --> 00:23.484
I wasn't really thinking...

00:23.498 --> 00:24.983
Come on. You gotta
be excited.

00:25.205 --> 00:27.116
Oh, well, I guess
maybe I'm a little,

00:27.192 --> 00:28.634
kind of sort of excited...

00:28.655 --> 00:29.888
I thought so.

00:30.066 --> 00:31.882
Yeah. So, um...

00:32.284 --> 00:33.633
why am I excited?

00:33.720 --> 00:35.734
Because the next Daring Do
book is coming out

00:35.750 --> 00:37.767
exactly four months from today!

00:37.824 --> 00:40.040
THAT'S how exciting it is!

00:40.117 --> 00:43.067
So what amazing, incredible,
awesome adventure

00:43.096 --> 00:45.221
do you think Daring Do will
have in her next book, huh?

00:45.666 --> 00:48.589
<i>Will she at long last</i>
<i>stalk the Fortress of Talocan?</i>

00:49.488 --> 00:51.773
<i>Only to be forced to</i>
<i>contend with its dreaded</i>

00:51.785 --> 00:53.654
<i>and impenetrable</i>
<i>arrow defense?</i>

00:53.760 --> 00:56.800
<i>And if so, could her skill,</i>
<i>quick wits and courage</i>

00:56.819 --> 00:58.120
<i>possibly carry the day?</i>

00:59.303 --> 01:03.096
<i>Or will her next adventure</i>
<i>bring her face-to-face</i>

01:03.266 --> 01:06.400
<i>with the vast and</i>
<i>horrible Ahuizotl himself?</i>

01:09.385 --> 01:10.864
<i>Would she cower?</i>

01:10.897 --> 01:11.931
<i>Turn tail and run?</i>

01:11.994 --> 01:14.421
<i>Or would she fly at</i>
<i>him full bore,</i>

01:14.460 --> 01:16.524
<i>knowing full well</i>
<i>against all odds</i>

01:16.665 --> 01:18.961
<i>that the greatest challenge</i>
<i>she'd ever faced</i>

01:18.999 --> 01:20.979
<i>was still sure to</i>
<i>be no match for--</i>

01:21.086 --> 01:22.595
<i>Look out!</i>

01:27.127 --> 01:30.954
Oh, I'm not so sure she's going
to last another four months.

01:33.508 --> 01:39.365

02:09.274 --> 02:10.671
Three months and
twenty-six days.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.124
Three months and
twenty-six days!

02:12.140 --> 02:13.750
Three months and
twenty-six days!

02:14.542 --> 02:16.772
Hey Twilight, aren't
you excited that--

02:19.405 --> 02:21.507
So glad you finally made it!

02:21.509 --> 02:23.742
What's everypony doing here?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.744
We're having a holiday party.

02:26.881 --> 02:29.915
So what holiday would today be?

02:30.290 --> 02:32.095
National Random
Holiday Party Day.

02:32.347 --> 02:33.516
Whoo hoo!

02:33.587 --> 02:35.320
I'd never heard of it either.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.289
But the punch is quite tasty.

02:37.504 --> 02:39.588
You might say the
secret ingredient is...

02:40.677 --> 02:42.444
A secret.

02:43.385 --> 02:45.683
How come nopony
bothered to invite me?

02:45.863 --> 02:47.750
I came to invite you personally.

02:47.951 --> 02:50.440
But it seems you were
a speck too busy

02:50.454 --> 02:53.974
reading the last Daring Do
book for the twelfth time.

02:53.996 --> 02:56.132
Yeah, well, in three months
and twenty-six more days

02:56.146 --> 02:57.826
I'll be able to read
the next one.

02:58.044 --> 02:59.334
Oh, haven't you heard?

02:59.438 --> 03:02.076
The release of the next book
got pushed another two months.

03:04.595 --> 03:06.015
Two more months?!

03:06.187 --> 03:08.323
I've been waiting
so long already,

03:08.544 --> 03:10.284
I don't think I can take
another two months!

03:10.511 --> 03:11.385
I'll never make it!

03:12.275 --> 03:14.368
Yeah, I can vouch
for that.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.663
Did they give a reason?

03:17.929 --> 03:19.843
The publisher just said
author A.K. Yearling

03:19.855 --> 03:22.039
won't be able to finish the
book for another two months.

03:22.296 --> 03:23.176
Cupcakes?

03:24.704 --> 03:27.573
How could you possibly
know that before me?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.520
I'm the series' biggest fan!

03:29.607 --> 03:31.441
I'm just as big a fan as you.

03:31.516 --> 03:34.126
In fact, I'm the one who first
introduced you to the books.

03:34.191 --> 03:35.026
Remember?

03:35.391 --> 03:36.316
Oh. Right.

03:36.374 --> 03:38.868
A.K. Yearling just might
be my favorite author.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.579
I know everything about her.

03:40.745 --> 03:41.566
Where she grew up.

03:41.799 --> 03:43.135
Where she studied literature.

03:43.344 --> 03:45.324
Where she wrote
the first Daring Do book...

03:45.877 --> 03:46.915
Where she lives?

03:47.020 --> 03:48.433
Uh, no...

03:48.751 --> 03:51.223
though I could probably
find out somehow.

03:51.496 --> 03:51.986
Why?

03:52.251 --> 03:53.356
Don't you get it?

03:53.703 --> 03:56.444
The new book is obviously
delayed because she needs help

03:56.454 --> 03:59.186
dealing with whatever everyday
nonsense is distracting her

03:59.198 --> 04:02.236
from spending her every living
breathing second writing!

04:02.435 --> 04:05.642
So I...I mean fans like me,

04:05.765 --> 04:07.486
can get to read the
next book ASAP!

04:07.715 --> 04:08.478
Think about it.

04:08.835 --> 04:11.681
We could help her with her
laundry, buying her groceries,

04:11.711 --> 04:12.653
cooking her meals.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.254
Whatever.

04:13.691 --> 04:15.666
Now who wouldn't
appreciate that?

04:15.822 --> 04:17.775
Hmm, I don't know.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.911
What she probably wants most of
all is respect for her privacy.

04:21.049 --> 04:22.645
She can always just say no.

04:26.430 --> 04:29.032
Mmh... I suppose you're right.

04:29.285 --> 04:30.517
Of course I am.

04:32.241 --> 04:34.101
So how's about
getting that address?

04:49.061 --> 04:50.202
You see what I mean?

04:50.409 --> 04:52.684
Why would she live in this
remote part of Equestria

04:52.694 --> 04:55.521
except to keep folks from
intruding on her privacy?

04:55.695 --> 04:56.515
We should respect--

04:56.522 --> 04:57.884
I think I spotted
the house!

04:58.040 --> 04:59.059
We're super-close.

04:59.073 --> 04:59.820
This way!

05:00.634 --> 05:01.529
Wait!

05:04.476 --> 05:05.131
Oh no!

05:05.436 --> 05:06.444
What happened?

05:06.750 --> 05:08.766
<i>Apparently, somepony has intruded</i>

05:08.772 --> 05:11.229
<i>on her privacy</i>
<i>pretty hard already.</i>

05:20.208 --> 05:23.550
<i>Ooowee. Somepony really</i>
<i>trashed this place.</i>

05:24.109 --> 05:25.373
Hmm. Maybe.

05:25.564 --> 05:26.653
<i>Or...</i>

05:26.764 --> 05:28.583
maybe A.K. Yearling's just
a terrible, horrible,

05:28.595 --> 05:30.165
unbelievable slob.

05:31.059 --> 05:33.475
I hope A.K.
Yearling's all right.

05:33.545 --> 05:36.124
Oh no! What if something
terrible happened to her?

05:36.179 --> 05:38.852
I know! There might
be no more books!

05:39.459 --> 05:43.783
Uh, but of course I'd be
worried about her, too. Heh.

05:43.935 --> 05:45.676
What are you all doing here?

05:46.981 --> 05:51.510
Uh..A...K...Yearling?

05:53.258 --> 05:55.875
We didn't do
this; we swear!

05:56.411 --> 05:58.505
What have you done to my house?

05:58.706 --> 06:00.054
We didn't do this,
Ms. Yearling.

06:00.060 --> 06:00.481
Agh!

06:02.007 --> 06:04.382
We're awfully glad to
see you're all right.

06:07.660 --> 06:10.501
OK, clearly this
isn't the best time,

06:10.530 --> 06:14.805
but I just gotta say how much
we all really love your books.

06:14.852 --> 06:15.775
Heh heh.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.890
Ah. It's safe.

06:33.539 --> 06:33.943
Great!

06:34.478 --> 06:36.922
Maybe now would be a good
time for me to ask her

06:36.938 --> 06:39.933
how we can help move the
new book along a little faster.

06:40.271 --> 06:41.002
Chop chop.

06:42.991 --> 06:45.036
Rainbow Dash, a
minute please.

06:47.151 --> 06:48.805
A.K. Yearling has
made it pretty clear

06:48.811 --> 06:50.378
that she wants to
be left alone.

06:50.624 --> 06:52.489
We need to respect
her wishes.

06:53.482 --> 06:55.057
You should tell that
to those guys.

07:19.145 --> 07:22.251
A.K. Yearling IS Daring Do!

07:26.417 --> 07:29.551
<i>A.K. Yearling and Daring Do</i>
<i>are one-and-the-same.</i>

07:29.646 --> 07:31.972
My mind is officially blown.

07:32.197 --> 07:34.870
Aw, come on. I knew
it all along.

07:39.147 --> 07:40.144
Amazing.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.228
Incredible.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.610
<i>Wow! So much action!</i>

08:00.842 --> 08:01.680
<i>Wheeeeeee!</i>

08:03.914 --> 08:05.028
Daring Do!

08:15.028 --> 08:17.996
Many thanks, Daring Do.

08:18.255 --> 08:22.485
As you probably surmised, our
earlier search for this treasure

08:22.511 --> 08:24.655
was unsuccessful.

08:25.077 --> 08:27.818
So kind of you to
find it for us.

08:30.245 --> 08:32.040
Give it back, Caballeron!

08:32.411 --> 08:35.244
That's Dr. Caballeron to you!

08:35.529 --> 08:37.927
He's from Book 4: Daring
Do and the Razor of Dreams.

08:37.974 --> 08:39.943
He wanted to partner with
Daring Do on her adventures.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.652
I know. But she
refused.

08:41.660 --> 08:42.651
I can't believe it.

08:42.696 --> 08:45.586
The real Daring Do and
the real Caballeron!

08:45.726 --> 08:48.819
So let me guess:
Ahuizotl has put you up to this.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.178
You're stealing the
ring to give to him

08:51.211 --> 08:53.211
so his hold on the
Fortress of Talocan

08:53.246 --> 08:54.723
will be good
for Eight Centuries

08:54.733 --> 08:55.972
as foretold by prophesy.

08:56.056 --> 08:56.897
Close...

08:57.088 --> 08:58.575
but no.

08:58.636 --> 09:01.346
I'm going to sell this
to him, make a bundle

09:01.354 --> 09:04.304
<i>and retire from</i>
<i>archeology in splendor.</i>

09:06.265 --> 09:07.736
Caballeron, you fool!

09:08.060 --> 09:10.083
You're dooming the valley
to eight centuries

09:10.091 --> 09:11.720
of unrelenting heat!

09:11.806 --> 09:13.658
To market, henchponies.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.593
Uh... should we go in
and help her maybe?

09:21.955 --> 09:23.361
Oh. Right!

09:25.250 --> 09:26.645
Are you OK?

09:26.727 --> 09:27.802
I've got this.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.979
Um... She was just
trying to help, Ms. Do.

09:31.194 --> 09:32.641
Daring Do doesn't need help.

09:33.041 --> 09:35.073
She handles her
business herself.

09:39.707 --> 09:40.743
<i>We've got to go help!</i>

09:40.825 --> 09:43.902
You heard her. She
says she works alone.

09:44.111 --> 09:46.421
How can we just stand
by and do nothing?

09:46.645 --> 09:47.769
You know what's at stake here?

09:47.857 --> 09:50.349
Ahuizotl has sought control
of the Tenochtitlan Basin

09:50.454 --> 09:51.496
since Book 3.

09:51.845 --> 09:54.723
True, but in Book 4,
she defeated Ahuizotl

09:54.739 --> 09:56.762
and secured control of the
Amulet of Atonement,

09:56.858 --> 09:59.287
dispelling the dark magic
of the Ketztwctl Empress

09:59.488 --> 10:00.509
and thus protecting the basin

10:00.515 --> 10:01.996
with the Radiant
Shield of Razdon.

10:02.177 --> 10:03.492
But the Radiant
Shield of Razdon

10:03.500 --> 10:04.835
is vulnerable to the
dark enchantment

10:04.844 --> 10:06.040
of the Rings of Scorchero.

10:06.181 --> 10:07.959
But are you forgetting that
the rings were scattered

10:07.960 --> 10:09.717
to the four corners of
Tenochtitlan,

10:09.863 --> 10:11.845
thus rendering the dark
enchantment powerless?

10:12.072 --> 10:14.993
Only if you assume that the
rings have yet to be retrieved

10:15.032 --> 10:16.507
and the ring
Caballeron just stole

10:16.519 --> 10:18.727
isn't the last to completely
restore the dark tower

10:18.839 --> 10:20.887
and its cruel hold
on Tenochtitlan.

10:20.917 --> 10:21.939
Did you ever think of that?

10:22.226 --> 10:25.092
You gotta admit, Rainbow
Dash makes a pretty good point.

10:25.461 --> 10:27.194
We've gotta help Daring
Do retrieve the ring

10:27.205 --> 10:29.182
for safekeeping
before it's too late.

10:29.789 --> 10:33.623
OK. But sounds to me
like we're in way way way

10:33.633 --> 10:34.610
over our heads.

10:34.723 --> 10:37.461
We're going to need a
carefully thought out plan.

10:37.906 --> 10:39.832
<i>I'm coming,</i>
<i>Daring Do!</i>

10:40.015 --> 10:41.184
That's not a plan!

10:43.254 --> 10:45.080
Come on, come on, come on!

10:47.387 --> 10:48.214
<i>Bingo!</i>

10:48.757 --> 10:50.019
Here I come, Daring Do.

10:50.364 --> 10:53.184
To join in adventure with
the greatest, bravest, coolest,

10:53.190 --> 10:55.069
most incredible hero
I could ever...

10:59.184 --> 11:01.521
OK, maybe I just need a sec.

11:03.717 --> 11:04.977
Just another adventure.

11:05.252 --> 11:06.288
No big deal.

11:08.522 --> 11:09.239
Get a grip!

11:09.717 --> 11:10.620
I got this.

11:11.598 --> 11:14.431
Though doing it
alongside Daring Do?

11:14.632 --> 11:17.178
Wow, maybe I could get my
picture taken with her.

11:17.278 --> 11:17.939
Or an autograph.

11:19.385 --> 11:20.554
There you go again.

11:20.757 --> 11:23.053
She's just a pony like
any other pony.

11:24.296 --> 11:26.958
A pony who stops entire
armies of bad guys

11:27.002 --> 11:28.887
with nothing more than
her bare hooves

11:29.084 --> 11:30.300
and an attitude and

11:31.543 --> 11:32.119
Ow.

11:32.165 --> 11:33.800
Ow... That's starting to hurt.

11:33.984 --> 11:34.505
Aargh!

11:36.530 --> 11:37.287
Ow!

11:38.345 --> 11:38.946
Stop!

11:39.098 --> 11:40.468
Oh. It's just you.

11:41.457 --> 11:43.326
Wait, don't go!

11:47.508 --> 11:49.840
Think fast. This is your
big chance to impress her

11:49.855 --> 11:51.342
with your quick wit and courage.

11:59.012 --> 12:02.640
I am suuuuch a huge fan.

12:02.657 --> 12:05.295
Heh heh heh heh.

12:07.849 --> 12:08.450
Wait, wait, wait.

12:08.509 --> 12:09.315
Let me help you.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.707
I promise I can be
a huge, huge help

12:11.713 --> 12:13.172
if you just give
me a chance.

12:13.451 --> 12:14.222
I...

12:14.425 --> 12:15.180
Work...

12:15.311 --> 12:16.384
Alone.

12:17.806 --> 12:20.222
But why won't you let me
team up with you just this once?

12:20.238 --> 12:22.208
My work always
involves secrets,

12:22.444 --> 12:24.341
and since you never know
who you can trust,

12:24.480 --> 12:26.915
it's best never to
trust anypony.

12:27.092 --> 12:29.047
But just because you
can't trust some

12:29.057 --> 12:31.229
doesn't mean nopony
can be trusted.

12:31.506 --> 12:33.205
Look, I don't have
time to argue.

12:33.213 --> 12:34.323
Neither do I. Let's go!

12:37.500 --> 12:39.428
I can't believe I'm
even talking to her.

12:46.971 --> 12:48.729
Looks like they decided
to have an early dinner

12:48.733 --> 12:50.214
before making their way
back down the hill

12:50.228 --> 12:51.502
to the marketplace in town.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.096
Oh, I see! You're
going to ambush them

12:57.106 --> 12:59.088
like you did in Book 4
at the Horavian Caves.

12:59.270 --> 13:01.453
Or maybe that neat
trick you did in Book 3

13:01.545 --> 13:03.159
where you swoop in and
knock three guys down

13:03.160 --> 13:04.930
with one swing. Or maybe...

13:06.101 --> 13:07.972
OK. I'll be quiet now.

13:08.284 --> 13:11.482
Just watching very
quietly. Shh.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.755
So what kind of ambush
are you gonna use then?

13:18.230 --> 13:19.364
Wow!

13:24.150 --> 13:25.607
I have been led to believe

13:25.615 --> 13:26.852
you have in
your possession

13:26.862 --> 13:29.242
an item of significant
importance

13:29.276 --> 13:31.207
that might be for sale.

13:31.861 --> 13:35.473
Oh, um, well, I did have
another buyer lined up.

13:35.488 --> 13:37.131
But he's not here, so...

13:37.479 --> 13:39.463
sounds like we have a deal.

13:43.545 --> 13:44.591
Caballeron!

13:44.891 --> 13:46.391
Ahuizotl!

13:46.600 --> 13:47.475
The ring!

13:57.715 --> 14:00.039
Be cool, Rainbow Dash, be cool.

14:00.306 --> 14:01.695
She's got this.

14:01.863 --> 14:03.656
The ring, Daring Do.

14:03.845 --> 14:05.221
Give it to me.

14:06.821 --> 14:09.703
Now Ahuizotl, you know
I love you,

14:09.937 --> 14:13.539
but I can't give you the ring
till I've properly proposed.

14:16.780 --> 14:17.949
Interesting.

14:18.072 --> 14:21.691
Because my friends here
have a proposal of their own.

14:24.659 --> 14:25.863
Meow!

14:33.492 --> 14:34.357
Bring it!

14:47.853 --> 14:50.809
Come on, Daring Do, come on!

14:54.286 --> 14:56.193
Daring Do. I've got your hat!

14:56.288 --> 14:57.410
Want me to toss it?

14:58.220 --> 15:00.452
Daring Do! DARING DO!

15:03.603 --> 15:06.237
<i>Aaaaahh!</i>

15:13.951 --> 15:15.252
Don't worry, Daring Do.

15:15.426 --> 15:16.720
I'll come help you!

15:17.155 --> 15:17.777
Whoa!

15:19.203 --> 15:20.195
Don't bother.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.594
I'd say you've already
"helped" plenty.

15:25.812 --> 15:27.432
What have I done?

15:33.518 --> 15:35.734
<i>Oh, thank goodness</i>
<i>you're all right.</i>

15:35.976 --> 15:37.336
Quick. Where does it hurt?

15:38.341 --> 15:39.375
In here.

15:39.504 --> 15:43.135
Daring Do and the ring have been
captured by the dreaded Ahuizotl

15:43.188 --> 15:45.303
and it's all my fault.

15:46.965 --> 15:50.033
Dash, I'm sure whatever
you did was an honest mistake.

15:50.720 --> 15:51.391
Whatever.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.595
Let's just go home.

15:52.991 --> 15:54.325
We can't go back now!

15:54.727 --> 15:56.852
Looks a might like she
needs our help more than ever.

15:57.510 --> 16:00.640
Trying to help is how I got
in this mess in the first place.

16:01.055 --> 16:02.640
You were right, Twilight.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.417
We should've stayed out of this.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.615
Look, there's more going
on here than meets the eye.

16:07.873 --> 16:10.136
In every Daring Do book
there always is.

16:10.357 --> 16:12.064
We can't turn our backs on her.

16:12.284 --> 16:14.655
She doesn't want
my help, Twilight.

16:15.086 --> 16:15.990
Perhaps.

16:16.212 --> 16:17.908
But she might
need it anyway.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.280
No. My hero's way
better off without me.

16:21.705 --> 16:23.194
This don't
sound like you.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.424
Where's the Rainbow Dash
who would help anypony

16:25.436 --> 16:26.530
at the drop of a hat?

16:26.823 --> 16:28.819
Or pith helmet, as
the case may be.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.693
She's here, where she's
got no business being.

16:32.122 --> 16:33.510
She should be at home.

16:35.069 --> 16:36.745
It's fine to look up
to Daring Do,

16:36.989 --> 16:39.102
but you've put her
so high up on a pedestal

16:39.205 --> 16:41.406
you can't even see your
own worth anymore.

16:41.888 --> 16:44.241
She's in the fortress
and we're here.

16:44.372 --> 16:47.213
And we wouldn't be who we are
if we didn't go in after her.

16:47.853 --> 16:49.079
<i>And neither would you.</i>

16:49.582 --> 16:52.591
So are you with us or not?

17:12.803 --> 17:16.725
Surrender now, Ahuizotl, or
I'll be forced to take you down.

17:21.135 --> 17:25.980
Oh, Daring Do, I will so miss
your amusing laughter-jokes.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.752
Now I must leave to commence
the ring-placing ceremony

17:29.908 --> 17:35.869
to unleash 800 years of
unrelenting sweltering heat.

18:08.686 --> 18:09.469
Gotcha!

18:12.329 --> 18:14.087
You can flap too, you know.

18:18.312 --> 18:20.958
I was just about to save
myself, you know.

18:21.184 --> 18:22.187
Of course.

18:22.234 --> 18:24.552
I just thought you
might need this.

18:27.666 --> 18:30.247
Have I mentioned yet
that I work alone?

18:30.464 --> 18:33.344
Have I mentioned yet that
you're lucky I don't?

18:49.527 --> 18:52.934
Drop the ring,
Huiz-whatever-your-name-is.

18:54.115 --> 18:55.508
Place the ring, quickly!

19:02.040 --> 19:02.581
Get it!

19:18.919 --> 19:19.715
Come with me.

19:23.014 --> 19:24.692
Help me get all these rings off.

19:34.616 --> 19:36.741
If we can remove the giant
ring at the bottom,

19:37.004 --> 19:38.899
the whole fortress
will collapse.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.419
Was this your
plan all along?

19:42.538 --> 19:44.788
I had to find a way to
get into the fortress.

19:44.973 --> 19:47.812
You did it on purpose?
But I thought--

19:48.487 --> 19:51.276
Didn't count on how heavy
this ring would be, though.

19:51.381 --> 19:54.005
Guess having a little
help can be handy sometimes.

20:05.256 --> 20:07.666
Stop her!

20:11.603 --> 20:13.691
You can flap too, you know.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.952
Ponies! Run! This place
is going down!

20:36.917 --> 20:38.431
Daring Do!

20:38.571 --> 20:41.650
I will have my revenge!

20:44.089 --> 20:46.585
Could never have done this
without you, Rainbow Dash.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.457
I've got a book to finish!

20:56.759 --> 21:00.394
<i>Just had the coolest adventure</i>
<i>with the coolest pony ever.</i>

21:00.532 --> 21:02.881
<i>Came this close to blowing it</i>
<i>because I got so wrapped up</i>

21:02.893 --> 21:06.290
<i>in how awesome she was, I</i>
<i>almost forgot how awesome I was.</i>

21:06.550 --> 21:09.650
Good thing I didn't, 'cause it
gave me a chance to show her

21:09.666 --> 21:12.357
how important it is to put
your trust in somepony else.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.030
Package from A.K. Yearling.

21:19.334 --> 21:20.222
Sweet!

21:20.507 --> 21:23.229
The new book a week
before anypony else gets it.

21:26.329 --> 21:28.280
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my GOSH!
