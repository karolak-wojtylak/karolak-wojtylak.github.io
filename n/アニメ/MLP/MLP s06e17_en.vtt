WEBVTT

00:06.320 --> 00:07.021
Tea?

00:07.956 --> 00:10.123
Trendy coats,
bedrolls, saddlebags?

00:10.166 --> 00:13.987
Ooooh! A surprise vacation
just for the two of us?

00:14.067 --> 00:15.384
How thoughtful!

00:15.483 --> 00:19.587
I hear Puerto Caballo is
lovely this time of year.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.104
Sand like powdered sugar.

00:24.276 --> 00:26.375
Um, Princess
Celestia is taking us

00:26.393 --> 00:29.064
on an overnight goodwill
tour of Yakyakistan.

00:29.193 --> 00:30.412
I just found out.

00:30.996 --> 00:37.489
So what you're saying is
no tea? Oh well, that's fine.

00:37.526 --> 00:39.329
I wasn't thirsty anyway.

00:43.470 --> 00:45.236
If you're looking
for something to do,

00:45.366 --> 00:48.073
you could spend the evening
with Spike and Big Mac.

00:48.707 --> 00:53.046
Ha.

00:54.104 --> 00:55.101
You aren't kidding.

00:55.520 --> 00:59.046
They're very nice. They have
a "Top Secret" thing they do

00:59.090 --> 01:00.473
whenever we leave
Ponyville,

01:00.720 --> 01:02.627
although everypony
knows about it,

01:02.689 --> 01:04.313
so it's not a
very good secret.

01:04.646 --> 01:06.240
I think you'd
have fun with them.

01:06.412 --> 01:08.707
"Fun?" With sidekicks?

01:08.756 --> 01:10.596
Oh, you must think that
we're in a dimension

01:10.640 --> 01:13.033
where everything
is opposite.

01:14.086 --> 01:17.760
Da dee la! I'm Opposite Discord

01:17.901 --> 01:20.412
and I want to hang out
with Spike and Big Mac!

01:20.646 --> 01:23.070
I'm sure I'd have fun.

01:23.187 --> 01:25.200
WELL GUESS WHAT, SASSAFRAS!

01:25.433 --> 01:28.480
I'M OPPOSITE FLUTTERSHY
AND I'M SICK OF BEING NICE

01:28.523 --> 01:30.449
AND QUIET ALL THE TIME!

01:31.864 --> 01:34.252
Let me explain it to
you as simply as I can.

01:34.510 --> 01:38.830
Me? Amazing. Them? Well,
I've already forgotten

01:38.880 --> 01:40.910
who we're talking
about. You see?

01:41.421 --> 01:43.944
All I'm saying is
it's an opportunity

01:43.993 --> 01:46.344
to expand your
circle of friends.

01:47.433 --> 01:50.492
Unless you're afraid
they won't like you.

01:51.507 --> 01:55.593
Oh please, don't stoop to
tedious reverse psychology.

01:55.858 --> 01:57.366
You're better than that.

01:57.883 --> 02:00.073
It never hurts to
make new friends.

02:01.575 --> 02:03.649
Hmph. Consider
it considered.

02:07.218 --> 02:09.975
Couldn't I just come
with you instead?

02:17.605 --> 02:22.600

Eeyup, eeyup eeyup eeyup! eeyup eeyup?! nnope!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

02:53.353 --> 02:55.827
I suppose this is
goodbye, then.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.452
Have an absolutely
fabulous voyage.

03:02.529 --> 03:03.963
Discord.

03:04.812 --> 03:07.046
Well, it's not my fault
the new train route

03:07.113 --> 03:10.855
leads into an active volcano.
Guess you'll have to stay.

03:13.384 --> 03:14.769
Oh, you're no fun.

03:17.181 --> 03:18.713
I got my bedroll, parka,

03:18.769 --> 03:20.843
unattractive but
functional hikin' boots.

03:21.027 --> 03:22.978
Uh, anything I
forgot, Pinkie Pie?

03:23.163 --> 03:25.366
You're our resident
Yakyakistan expert.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.827
Nope! I brought
Yeti food.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.344
Did I forget to mention
there's a pony-eating Yeti

03:32.406 --> 03:35.784
on Frostfield Glacier? We're
gonna have so much fun!

03:36.430 --> 03:41.526
Ha. If he messes with us, I'll
turn that Yeti into confetti.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.335
Somepony's in an awful quick
hurry to get us outta here.

03:51.729 --> 03:53.969
Don't y'all have too
much fun without us.

03:55.113 --> 03:58.566
I bet you boys have big
plans. Right, Spike?

03:58.849 --> 04:00.689
I'm sure I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:01.735 --> 04:04.160
Although if I did, I
certainly wouldn't be

04:04.215 --> 04:06.375
allowed to discuss
it with you girls.

04:07.987 --> 04:09.218
Bye-bye!

04:11.550 --> 04:12.455
Bye y'all!

04:31.571 --> 04:33.802
Fascinating article, yes?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.329
Don't let them come over,
please don't

04:36.395 --> 04:39.370
let them come over,
please, please, please!

04:39.449 --> 04:41.557
Oh! Salutations, my friends!

04:41.647 --> 04:44.527
Wish I could stay and chat,
but... I don't want to.

04:45.050 --> 04:50.936
Wait! Um, we were wondering...
what are you up to tonight?

04:53.223 --> 04:54.465
Here we go.

04:54.687 --> 04:57.317
Do you want to, I
don't know... hang out?

04:57.543 --> 04:59.101
Is that like
something you do?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.520
Oh, Twilight's friend

05:01.560 --> 05:03.458
and Applejack's
monosyllabic brother!

05:03.515 --> 05:07.167
If only I weren't super
busy this evening.

05:08.649 --> 05:11.214
I guess Guys' Night
will just be you and me.

05:13.557 --> 05:14.315
A Guys' Night?

05:14.578 --> 05:16.776
You mean a rowdy evening
of reckless revelry?

05:17.101 --> 05:19.152
Zoot suits, fedoras,
swing dancing?

05:20.136 --> 05:21.392
Eh, something like that.

05:21.590 --> 05:23.571
You should totally come!

05:24.000 --> 05:26.484
Three of us would be
way better than two.

05:27.788 --> 05:30.329
That does sound
fun, actually.

05:30.945 --> 05:31.844
Too bad you're busy.

05:34.030 --> 05:36.437
Well, I suppose I
could squeeze you in

05:36.475 --> 05:39.181
if I moved a few very
important ponies around.

05:39.731 --> 05:43.548
June, honey? Be a dear,
reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay?

05:43.811 --> 05:46.310
That's what I call Princess
Celestia. What a hoot.

05:46.531 --> 05:48.037
In fact, clear
the whole evening.

05:48.110 --> 05:49.407
Tonight is Guys' Night.

05:49.656 --> 05:51.651
These fellas invited
me to spice things up

05:51.708 --> 05:53.915
and bring a little class
to the whole affair.

05:55.957 --> 05:58.061
Tonight will be the best
night of your lives.

05:58.202 --> 06:01.590
And not just because you
get to bask in my greatness.

06:01.990 --> 06:04.320
I do love basking in
things. See you tonight!

06:04.851 --> 06:07.938
Twilight's castle. The fun
starts promptly at sundown.

06:08.730 --> 06:10.541
Technically the fun
starts when I arrive,

06:10.597 --> 06:14.461
but I'll make sure it's
around sunset. Adieu, fellas.

06:20.070 --> 06:25.769
And... we have sundown.
Repeat: we have sundown.

06:26.254 --> 06:29.072
I declare tonight's
GUYS' NIGHT ceremonies

06:29.265 --> 06:32.160
officially... OPEN!

06:32.465 --> 06:34.310
EEYUP!

06:34.804 --> 06:38.447
It's Guys' Night aw yeah
havin' fun now, aw yeah.

06:41.887 --> 06:42.616
What the hay?

06:50.489 --> 06:53.360
Announcing the
much-anticipated arrival

06:53.458 --> 06:55.345
of the Spirit of
Chaos and Disharmony,

06:55.397 --> 06:58.785
the Purveyor of Pandemoneum,
Lord of Lawlessness,

06:58.842 --> 07:01.708
Earl of Turmoil,
Bringer of Bedlam...

07:01.891 --> 07:05.722
Du-du-dun-dun-dunana DISCORD!

07:18.588 --> 07:20.315
So shall we hop to it?

07:20.489 --> 07:22.611
I've made a list of the
rowdiest establishments

07:22.644 --> 07:26.785
in Ponyville. It's
rather short.

07:28.004 --> 07:29.374
Actually we're staying here.

07:29.510 --> 07:31.887
I hope you like
AWESOME GAMES!

07:33.289 --> 07:36.889
Games! I love games.
I'm great at games.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.748
Famous Ponies Charades?

07:41.063 --> 07:44.037
Oh this is an easy
one. Who am I?

07:45.887 --> 07:47.722
Huh? Huh?

07:49.378 --> 07:50.771
OH, COME ON!

07:51.383 --> 07:54.155
Uh, I'm talking
about a real game.

07:55.124 --> 07:57.529
Oh, you mean like trapping
best friend ponies

07:57.585 --> 08:00.691
in hedge mazes and turning
them against each other.

08:00.842 --> 08:02.371
Those were the days.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.783
Not exactly. Wait here.

08:10.320 --> 08:10.974
Whatever it is,

08:11.035 --> 08:13.844
it can only get better
by adding me to the mix.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.783
OK!

08:18.484 --> 08:21.054
In a world where
evil reigns supreme,

08:21.260 --> 08:23.552
a small band of
warriors stands tall

08:23.628 --> 08:29.190
against the darkness. This
is... Ogres & Oubliettes.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.484
Oh this looks like--

08:38.663 --> 08:40.672
--the best game
ever? You're right!

08:41.115 --> 08:42.305
Yes.

08:43.134 --> 08:46.512
Ogres & Obliettes is a fantasy
role-playing adventure game.

08:46.870 --> 08:49.430
Our goal? Defeat the
evil Squid Wizard,

08:49.581 --> 08:53.727
or as we call him "The Squizard."

08:59.708 --> 09:02.451
The Squizard has laid
siege to the last free city

09:02.494 --> 09:04.861
in Spiketopia; that's
the name of the land.

09:05.096 --> 09:07.618
He's kidnapped a beautiful
unicorn princess

09:07.745 --> 09:08.988
named Shmarity.

09:09.675 --> 09:12.720
Uh, which is like a
normal name in Spiketopia,

09:12.757 --> 09:15.105
so, you know, don't
think about it too much.

09:15.741 --> 09:19.185
Fear not. Your romantic
delusions are safe with me.

09:21.341 --> 09:24.748
First things first: you've got
to create a character. Name?

09:25.091 --> 09:27.708
How 'bout... "Discord."

09:29.684 --> 09:31.468
The whole point of the
game is you get to use

09:31.496 --> 09:33.477
your imagination and
be someone you're not.

09:34.150 --> 09:36.583
I'm Garbunkle, a
famous magician.

09:36.818 --> 09:39.665
Everyone treats me with
the utmost respect.

09:40.108 --> 09:41.454
Just like in real life.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.609
Now, don't get jealous, but
I'm a level 30 enchanter with

09:45.670 --> 09:49.110
major skill points assigned
to intellect and perception.

09:49.487 --> 09:50.564
Go on. I'm listening.

09:50.969 --> 09:53.910
Big Mac's character is
Sir McBiggun, a level 27

09:53.967 --> 09:56.428
black knight unicorn
from Castle Chadwick.

09:56.687 --> 09:57.604
I'm listening.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.461
When his king aligned
himself with the Squizard,

10:00.611 --> 10:03.200
Sir McBiggun would not
besmirch his honor.

10:03.289 --> 10:04.174
Nnope.

10:05.124 --> 10:06.174
I'm listening.

10:06.682 --> 10:10.432
And so it came to pass, the
magician and black knight

10:10.616 --> 10:13.731
vowed to rid Spiketopia
of the evil Squizard.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.049
So, your character's name...

10:19.265 --> 10:21.124
I already have the best
name in the universe.

10:21.270 --> 10:25.195
Why would I change it for
something like Captain Wuzz?

10:25.665 --> 10:27.251
Captain Wuzz it is!

10:31.200 --> 10:33.002
What class are
you, Captain Wuzz?

10:33.138 --> 10:35.449
There's archers,
mages, rogues...

10:36.776 --> 10:38.710
Can I suggest we take a
break and, I don't know,

10:38.743 --> 10:40.654
go out and have some fun?

10:40.800 --> 10:43.369
Ponyville's not going
to paint itself red.

10:43.976 --> 10:48.348
You'll love it once we get
started. How about an archer?

10:49.091 --> 10:53.957
Sounds just as miserable as
the other options, so fine.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.840
"Sir McBiggun," are you
prepared to enter the world

10:59.910 --> 11:01.835
of Ogres & Oubliettes?

11:02.112 --> 11:03.289
Eeyup.

11:03.590 --> 11:07.731
Discord, or should I say,
"Captain Wuzz," are you--

11:07.783 --> 11:09.007
Oh, get on with it.

11:12.334 --> 11:14.484
We find ourselves
trapped in the dungeon

11:14.640 --> 11:17.642
of the evil Squizard. The
bars are locked tight.

11:19.609 --> 11:20.903
The bars exist...

11:21.138 --> 11:23.665
...in our imagination.

11:24.536 --> 11:29.129
Really, you describe things
and then we pretend it's real.

11:29.477 --> 11:33.312
It is real...in
our imagination.

11:33.835 --> 11:35.943
It's your turn first.
What do you want to do?

11:36.423 --> 11:39.044
Curse myself for attending
this infernal evening?

11:40.127 --> 11:42.983
Oh ha ha, oh you
mean in the game.

11:43.256 --> 11:44.738
Well, you can do
whatever you want.

11:45.070 --> 11:48.094
Then I roll this 20-sided die
to see if you're successful.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.969
I stick my head through
the bars and demand

11:51.054 --> 11:53.741
for the immediate release
of the Lord of Chaos.

11:54.767 --> 11:55.943
That's a big risk.

11:56.070 --> 11:58.390
You have to roll a seventeen
or higher to succeed.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.061
Oh. Bad idea. The
guard gets mad.

12:05.661 --> 12:09.312
This spell here. I transform
him into a parsnip.

12:09.684 --> 12:11.515
You need eleven intelligent
points to cast a

12:11.534 --> 12:13.228
"Transform into Root
Vegetable" spell.

12:14.343 --> 12:15.712
I'm not intelligent?!

12:15.915 --> 12:19.016
I cast it anyway because
this game is stupid.

12:23.016 --> 12:24.818
The spell backfires...

12:24.997 --> 12:29.840
...so your claws grow leaves
and transform into parsnips.

12:31.496 --> 12:33.745
He heh. Parsnips.

12:37.595 --> 12:38.795
The guard laughs.

12:38.912 --> 12:41.524
He calls his friends
over and they laugh too.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.298
Don't you laugh at
ME, Big Mac!

12:45.590 --> 12:47.637
Does it really say
that? Let me see!

12:51.665 --> 12:55.030
As you get angrier,
everypony laughs harder.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.727
I seal Sir McBiggun
in a magic bubble

13:01.750 --> 13:03.632
until he stops laughing.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.124
I told you, you
can't do magic.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.654
Nnope! Nnope! Nnope!

13:15.788 --> 13:18.611
Not intelligent
enough, please...

13:18.851 --> 13:20.268
Cut it out, Discord!

13:20.574 --> 13:22.465
Oh, this game is
insufferable!

13:22.607 --> 13:25.251
Let me show you a
real Guys' Night.

13:26.470 --> 13:30.644
Ahhhhh, this is the
life. Jazz, dancing,

13:30.677 --> 13:33.044
the best table magic can buy.

13:33.289 --> 13:37.011
This is what Guys' Night is
all about. Am I right, fellas?

13:39.891 --> 13:40.781
Eeyup!

13:40.894 --> 13:42.903
I know you probably
didn't do this on purpose,

13:43.002 --> 13:45.171
but this table's the
perfect size and shape!

13:45.783 --> 13:48.291
I don't think so.
Let's have a drink.

13:49.468 --> 13:50.908
Chocolate milkshakes?

13:51.656 --> 13:53.468
No, we want to go
back to Ogres and-

13:53.487 --> 13:55.647
Oh, how about a
different game?

13:59.303 --> 14:02.004
Those are
very bad cards.

14:02.272 --> 14:03.990
Stop messing with
us, we want--!

14:04.381 --> 14:06.047
A dance contest?

14:11.072 --> 14:13.275
Surprise! We won.

14:13.948 --> 14:15.054
DISCORD!

14:15.910 --> 14:17.962
Yes...?

14:19.035 --> 14:21.101
Look, we don't want
to do these things.

14:21.223 --> 14:22.461
We want to play our game.

14:22.748 --> 14:24.362
If you don't want to
play with us, you can...

14:24.560 --> 14:25.990
I don't know, sit and watch.

14:26.776 --> 14:29.025
Sit and watch?

14:29.171 --> 14:31.962
Fine! We'll play your game.

14:32.578 --> 14:39.327
ARE YOU READY TO ENTER THE
WORLD OF OGRES & OBLIETTES?

14:43.609 --> 14:45.096
Sir McBiggun?

14:47.007 --> 14:48.291
EEYUP!

14:48.729 --> 14:52.070
And... I'm Garbunkle?
That means...

14:52.414 --> 14:57.115
Sweetness! We're in the
game! Check it out! Ka-ZAM!

15:12.061 --> 15:15.915
It's Guys' Night oh yeah!
In the game now oh yeah!

15:16.047 --> 15:17.665
Discord! Where are you?!

15:17.872 --> 15:19.807
This is great! You
made the game real!

15:20.141 --> 15:24.211
Aren't games fun?!

15:24.470 --> 15:26.936
Should we be worried he's
using his scary voice?

15:28.635 --> 15:33.957
Behold. I AM THE SQUIZARD!

15:36.404 --> 15:38.771
Oh, you're welcome.

15:39.143 --> 15:41.745
ATTACK!

15:48.338 --> 15:50.061
RUN!

16:00.329 --> 16:02.352
You find yourself on a battlefield.

16:02.512 --> 16:04.672
A barrage of arrows
rains down on you.

16:04.894 --> 16:06.451
If you roll a fifteen
or higher,

16:06.508 --> 16:07.920
the shield protects you.

16:08.061 --> 16:12.870
Fourteen or lower, and,
well, HA HA you get the idea.

16:16.931 --> 16:19.261
Seventeen! Lucky you!

16:26.000 --> 16:26.362
Boo!

16:26.428 --> 16:29.548
Discord!

16:30.964 --> 16:34.343
Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the
entrance if I were you.

16:36.889 --> 16:38.263
This isn't funny.

16:38.442 --> 16:40.291
Isn't this what
every gamer wants?

16:40.423 --> 16:43.364
To live the game. Like this!

16:51.548 --> 16:52.560
Agh!

16:57.294 --> 17:00.578
This kinda hurts.
Like, real pain!

17:00.931 --> 17:02.498
Oh, how kind of
you to notice.

17:02.517 --> 17:04.658
It's the little details
that really bring

17:04.696 --> 17:08.141
alternate dimensions to
life, wouldn't you say?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.541
Discord, this is awful!

17:11.454 --> 17:15.021
Of course it is!
Spiketopia will be mine!

17:15.160 --> 17:18.494
And Rarity shall be my bride!

17:19.087 --> 17:20.324
I mean "Schmarity."

17:24.282 --> 17:25.105
Agh!

17:25.317 --> 17:27.703
Why are you doing
this? You're the worst!

17:27.943 --> 17:30.517
If I'm the worst, then
why did you invite me?

17:30.865 --> 17:33.524
Because we felt
bad for you!

17:34.597 --> 17:37.058
Because you-- WHAT!?

17:40.028 --> 17:43.496
We're OK. We're OK! No
thanks to you, Discord!

17:43.816 --> 17:46.291
YOU felt sorry for ME?

17:46.847 --> 17:49.284
Who wouldn't? Fluttershy
told us you practically

17:49.322 --> 17:51.374
begged her to stay, and
then at the train station,

17:51.449 --> 17:53.760
you were just standing
there, all alone.

17:54.498 --> 17:57.054
This can't be. I'm supposed
to feel sorry for you.

17:57.091 --> 17:59.952
Because I'm me,
and you're you.

18:01.256 --> 18:03.063
We only invited you
to be nice.

18:03.251 --> 18:05.529
I mean, you're
kind of a weirdo.

18:05.661 --> 18:06.480
Eeyup.

18:07.007 --> 18:09.614
I ruined your night, and you
don't even think I'm cool?

18:10.630 --> 18:12.912
Oh, how embarrassing.

18:13.891 --> 18:15.576
I should go. I have
a lot of...

18:15.764 --> 18:18.004
OTHER friends I
need to see tonight.

18:18.202 --> 18:18.800
Good.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.574
Yes, so many other friends.

18:24.414 --> 18:27.082
Farewell, Garbunkle
the Magician

18:27.538 --> 18:29.680
and Brave Sir McBiggun.

18:29.872 --> 18:32.207
May providence smile
upon thee and thy quest

18:32.258 --> 18:36.108
to rid Spiketopia of
the dreaded Squizard.

18:37.289 --> 18:39.849
When I say it that way, the
game doesn't sound half-bad.

18:42.654 --> 18:43.345
Oh well.

18:45.242 --> 18:48.828
It's better this way,
right?

18:49.002 --> 18:49.505
Eeyup.

18:49.830 --> 18:53.016
Because now he can't bother
us cause he's off somewhere

18:53.044 --> 18:57.863
by himself... all
alone. With no friends.

18:58.287 --> 18:59.411
Eeyup.

19:02.004 --> 19:03.138
Ahem.

19:03.948 --> 19:06.997
We find ourselves in the
dungeon of the evil Squizard.

19:07.407 --> 19:10.480
The bars are locked,
and oh who am I kidding?

19:10.790 --> 19:12.324
We should give him
another chance.

19:13.924 --> 19:17.369
Captain Wuzz?
Can you hear me?!

19:18.277 --> 19:20.983
Oh, you realized
how amazing I am

19:21.082 --> 19:23.967
and that I make you cooler
just by being around me?

19:26.315 --> 19:30.207
Uh no, no, actually that's
not what I meant to say.

19:36.164 --> 19:36.785
What...?

19:37.134 --> 19:40.748
I'm...

19:40.847 --> 19:41.920
We can't hear you.

19:42.023 --> 19:42.484
Nnope.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.510
I'm trying to say
I'm sorry, all right?

19:45.552 --> 19:47.341
I'm sorry for
ruining your game,

19:47.411 --> 19:49.510
and I'm sorry that I thought
I was better than you.

19:50.903 --> 19:53.294
Now let's play before this
evening gets any sappier,

19:53.336 --> 19:54.056
shall we?

19:56.616 --> 19:58.508
Eeyup.

19:58.588 --> 20:01.025
Huh? Yeah, yeah OK!

20:02.023 --> 20:03.943
What if we forgot the board
and the pieces for a minute?

20:04.894 --> 20:06.757
I mean, the whole
"game coming to life"

20:06.809 --> 20:08.230
was completely terrifying,

20:08.357 --> 20:10.357
but also kinda the
best thing ever.

20:10.705 --> 20:13.529
So, uh Big Mac and
I were wondering...

20:13.755 --> 20:16.602
what if you toned it
down just a teensy bit?

20:26.117 --> 20:26.941
Huh?

20:33.614 --> 20:35.877
I've got your
back, Captain Wuzz!

20:47.708 --> 20:50.023
Garbunkle, follow my lead!

20:54.550 --> 20:55.557
Bullseye!

20:55.938 --> 20:57.421
Nice one!

20:57.581 --> 21:01.722
It's Guys' Night / aww yeah
/ havin' fun now / aww yeah.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.444
We should just close the
door and let them finish...

21:07.778 --> 21:09.232
whatever this is.

21:09.501 --> 21:14.282
No way! Did you see Big Mac's
sword! I totally want in!

21:14.889 --> 21:16.654
Yeah, I don't know
what it is,

21:16.767 --> 21:19.115
but it looks like
super-duper fun!

21:23.515 --> 21:25.298
GUYS' NIGHT!
