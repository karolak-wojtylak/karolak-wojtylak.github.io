WEBVTT

00:05.373 --> 00:07.706
Twilight! Look at the
scroll I just got!

00:09.377 --> 00:11.076
[gasp] Do you know what
this means?

00:11.178 --> 00:12.478
Uh huh!

00:12.680 --> 00:17.049
Uh, I don't. What's so
exciting about a toy crown?

00:17.151 --> 00:20.185
Oh-ho-ho, this is no toy crown.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.755
It's the hard-won helm
of the Sibling Supreme!

00:23.357 --> 00:24.957
When Shining Armor
and I were small,

00:25.159 --> 00:27.126
we competed over
EVERYTHING!

00:40.274 --> 00:42.541
To keep it friendly, our
parents gave us gold stars

00:42.643 --> 00:44.376
every time we did
something special.

00:47.414 --> 00:48.447
Sharing...

00:50.751 --> 00:52.084
Getting good grades...

00:53.954 --> 00:55.888
Even telling a
really funny joke!

00:56.390 --> 00:59.190
And at the end of each week,
we'd add up the stars.

01:01.128 --> 01:02.761
The sibling with the
most would win the crown

01:02.863 --> 01:04.363
of the Sibling Supreme

01:04.465 --> 01:06.398
<i>and</i> bragging rights
till next time!

01:08.102 --> 01:10.436
Guess that explains
your love of charts.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.071
And so much else...

01:12.773 --> 01:15.907
I always wanted to be
Sibling Supreme one day.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.676
Meet me at Celestia's Castle

01:17.778 --> 01:21.580
to decide who deserves the
crown once and for all.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.014
Both: Race ya there!

01:25.386 --> 01:27.651
Guess I'll...
watch the school?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.167
You're wearing it!?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.136
Look, I know you've
always held a grudge

02:17.238 --> 02:19.304
because I left
home with this.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.140
Grudge? Pff. What grudge?

02:21.242 --> 02:22.908
Just because you've
had it for <i>way</i> longer

02:23.010 --> 02:23.876
than you should have,

02:23.978 --> 02:25.778
and I never got a
chance to win it back...

02:26.880 --> 02:29.281
With the return of Sombra,
Princess Luna and I

02:29.383 --> 02:32.251
felt it was time to reinforce
the castle's defenses.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.887
<i>I</i> said we could
do it ourselves,

02:34.989 --> 02:37.724
but some ponies
are a bit stubborn.

02:38.926 --> 02:42.828
So I asked our old Captain of
the Guard to handle the job.

02:43.130 --> 02:46.532
I've taken the security
here to a whole new level.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.368
The only thing I need now
is somepony to test it.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.338
[gasp] You want me to break
into Celestia's castle?

02:52.840 --> 02:55.975
If you can get past my
defenses, steal the crown,

02:56.377 --> 02:59.444
and get out, you'll be
Sibling Supreme.

02:59.546 --> 03:00.512
Forever.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.349
[dreamy] Forever!

03:04.551 --> 03:07.719
BUT, if you fail,
I keep the crown.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.589
DEAL! Wait! Are you
sure this counts?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.824
Mom and Dad aren't
giving us any stars...

03:12.926 --> 03:14.826
Celestia: I will represent
their authority.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.229
And thank you, Twilight.
Your help will reveal

03:17.331 --> 03:19.130
if there are any
holes in our security.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.400
And there aren't.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.769
I've designed a
multi-tiered, impenetrable,

03:23.871 --> 03:26.004
triple-backed-up
line of defense.

03:27.141 --> 03:29.074
<i> The castle is</i>
<i> surrounded by shards</i>

03:29.176 --> 03:31.376
<i> of Queen Chrysalis' throne.</i>

03:31.578 --> 03:34.446
<i> Thanks to Starswirl, its</i>
<i> anti-magic powers are now</i>

03:34.548 --> 03:38.350
<i> tuned to stop anycreature from</i>
<i> using a spell to get inside.</i>

03:38.652 --> 03:40.652
<i> You can't fly in either.</i>

03:41.989 --> 03:44.123
<i> Giant fans keep any</i>
<i> creature from flying</i>

03:44.225 --> 03:45.690
<i> too close to the castle.</i>

03:49.363 --> 03:51.763
<i> Plus the entrances to the</i>
<i> tunnels below the castle</i>

03:51.865 --> 03:55.101
<i> have been sealed. So there's</i>
<i> no underground access.</i>

03:56.103 --> 03:58.303
<i> And even if you could</i>
<i> get in, which you can't,</i>

03:58.405 --> 04:00.072
<i> I've doubled the</i>
<i> ranks of security.</i>

04:00.174 --> 04:02.575
<i> Ponies protect every</i>
<i> hallway and door,</i>

04:03.077 --> 04:05.911
<i> which can only be opened</i>
<i> with Royal Guard medals.</i>

04:08.515 --> 04:10.215
Even if you brought an army...

04:10.317 --> 04:14.153
the throne room is the
safest spot in Equestria.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.288
I rigged a floor
trap to activate

04:16.390 --> 04:18.289
at the slightest touch.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.061
But say you avoid the floor...

04:23.163 --> 04:24.229
Still no luck.

04:24.331 --> 04:27.065
Because I've employed
Nature's alarm system.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.138
Geese?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.775
You can hear their honks
all the way in Ponyville.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.445
Plus they bite.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.320
So that's what we're up against.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.390
Huh. That's a barrel and
a half of obstacles,

04:51.592 --> 04:54.193
plus a bushel and a peck
of impenetrability.

04:54.295 --> 04:57.629
And all this is to win
some fillyhood competition

04:57.731 --> 04:59.198
with your brother?

04:59.700 --> 05:02.935
It's more than that!
OK, it's exactly that.

05:03.237 --> 05:05.170
...And to protect
Celestia's castle!

05:05.572 --> 05:08.740
If it means that much to
you, Twilight, we're in.

05:08.842 --> 05:09.908
I was already in!

05:10.010 --> 05:12.277
C'mon, who doesn't want
to hang with geese!?

05:12.379 --> 05:14.880
Of course we'll
help. But how?

05:15.282 --> 05:17.816
Shining Armor may have come
up with some great security,

05:17.918 --> 05:19.919
but he'll never guess
Twilight's plan.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.587
We play to our strengths

05:21.789 --> 05:23.989
and defeat all of the
security measures.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.091
That way, if one of
us fails, the others

05:26.193 --> 05:28.160
will still have a shot
at getting the crown.

05:28.362 --> 05:31.463
Pinkie, you'll distract the
guards with a surprise party.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.499
Yes sir, Twilight sir!

05:33.701 --> 05:36.568
Applejack, you'll buck your
way into the sealed tunnels.

05:36.970 --> 05:40.272
Rainbow Dash, if anypony can
outfly those wind turbines,

05:40.374 --> 05:41.173
it's you.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.642
Rarity, you'll sew
us guard costumes

05:43.744 --> 05:45.410
so we can sneak past security.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.546
Then Fluttershy will disable
the throne room alarm

05:47.648 --> 05:48.880
by charming the geese.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.753
It's from Shining Armor.

05:54.355 --> 05:58.323
Dear Twily, Hope your
idea isn't just...[muttering]

05:58.425 --> 06:00.692
Tunnels! He guessed
your whole plan!

06:00.994 --> 06:01.860
WHAT!?

06:02.162 --> 06:04.095
Pinkie party, Rarity costumes...

06:04.197 --> 06:07.832
Signed, the future Sibling
Supreme? Oh, come on!

06:08.735 --> 06:10.269
Rarity: Twilight, darling.

06:10.371 --> 06:13.105
Nopony knows you better
than your own brother.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.607
So you're saying
I should give up?

06:15.709 --> 06:18.343
I'm <i>saying</i> your
brother will win.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.112
No matter how
brilliant your plan is,

06:20.214 --> 06:22.681
no matter how many
variations you try,

06:22.783 --> 06:24.649
it will be something
your brother expects

06:24.751 --> 06:28.120
and he'll always win. Unless...

06:28.922 --> 06:30.756
When the perfect
chance comes along,

06:30.858 --> 06:34.826
you do something he can't
expect. Then, you'll win.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.629
You've been practicing
that speech, haven't you?

06:37.831 --> 06:40.365
A little bit. It felt like
I rushed. Did I rush it?

06:40.467 --> 06:41.566
Absolutely not.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.168
Oh! No!

06:43.270 --> 06:44.770
Yeah, it was fastish.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.173
We have to do the opposite of
what Shining Armor expects.

06:48.275 --> 06:51.677
Therefore, Twilight cannot
mastermind the plan...

06:52.179 --> 06:53.512
BUT I CAN!

06:54.615 --> 06:57.248
That's...definitely
unexpected.

07:02.056 --> 07:04.956
Uh.. how is YOU making
a break-in plan

07:05.058 --> 07:07.292
the opposite of
Twilight doing it?

07:07.694 --> 07:11.330
Because.. my plan is for
each of us to devise

07:11.432 --> 07:13.598
our own unexpected
part of it!

07:13.700 --> 07:15.366
Allow me to demonstrate.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.777
We're looking for a
pony with information.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.349
We got questions, and
you're gonna serve us up

07:30.451 --> 07:32.184
some answers,
juice jockey.

07:32.386 --> 07:33.952
Where is the secret
entrance to the passages

07:34.054 --> 07:35.687
under Canterlot Castle?

07:35.923 --> 07:38.457
Shining Armor sealed them all.
There is no secret entrance.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.492
There's always a
secret entrance!

07:40.894 --> 07:43.595
So make like a glass
of OJ and spill!

07:43.797 --> 07:46.098
Ooh! Ooh! I know what I can do!

07:46.600 --> 07:49.935
You're gonna need a lookout, so
I can be your eye in the sky!

07:50.337 --> 07:52.437
Too low, silly, up here!

08:01.815 --> 08:03.915
Oh, Pinkie! That tickles!

08:08.622 --> 08:09.788
What..!?

08:09.990 --> 08:13.725
How about somethin' a little
more down to earth. Like...

08:13.827 --> 08:16.495
I distract the guard ponies
with a farewell performance

08:16.597 --> 08:19.130
by my alter ego, famous
country western super-star,

08:19.232 --> 08:20.532
Apple Chord!

08:21.768 --> 08:23.502
I didn't know you
had an alter-ego.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.137
And why would she be giving
a farewell performance?

08:26.439 --> 08:29.307
Well, it's a long story.

08:31.812 --> 08:32.944
Back on the farm,

08:33.046 --> 08:35.714
playin' music was about
makin' her family smile.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.786
Word of her talent spread,

08:40.988 --> 08:44.289
and soon Apple Chord
was playin' real shows.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.560
The more she played, the
bigger those shows got.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.235
But she missed playin'
for her family.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.840
So one day, she gave it all up.

09:08.348 --> 09:11.149
Seeing her family smile
was all she ever wanted

09:11.251 --> 09:12.284
from her music.

09:12.486 --> 09:15.620
Of course, Apple Chord could
come out of retirement

09:15.722 --> 09:18.558
for a farewell
concert this one time...

09:19.560 --> 09:21.960
Wait. Did you just
make all that up

09:22.062 --> 09:23.962
or did that actually happen?

09:24.564 --> 09:25.397
Um...

09:25.499 --> 09:28.400
Doesn't matter. It's
perfect! Fluttershy? Spike?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.702
I guess the opposite
of what I'm good at

09:30.804 --> 09:33.605
is [gasp] being in small spaces....

09:33.707 --> 09:36.174
I always wanted
to be a super spy...

09:36.276 --> 09:37.909
Is that the opposite
of anything?

09:40.914 --> 09:44.215
Special Agent Fluttershy,
target detected below.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.152
It's almost too easy.

10:07.942 --> 10:10.976
Huh. I guess I'm the only one left
that still needs a plan.

10:11.078 --> 10:16.481
Oh, no, darling, that IS the
plan. You shall do nothing!

10:18.018 --> 10:20.485
Shining Armor definitely
won't expect that.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.906
Applejack? What are you doing?

10:41.208 --> 10:47.045
Applejack? Heh, heh, who's
that? My name's Apple Chord

10:47.147 --> 10:49.514
and I've got a couple
of songs to play for ya.

10:49.616 --> 10:53.318
Clap your hooves if you know
'em. And a one and a two and a..

11:02.462 --> 11:03.995
The Wonderbolts did a flyby,

11:04.097 --> 11:06.031
and the only way
past those giant fans

11:06.133 --> 11:08.233
and into the castle
ducts is here.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.535
But there's no
room for mistakes!

11:10.637 --> 11:12.504
Pinkie: Just like
space travel!

11:13.774 --> 11:18.243
Uh, Pinkie, we're not actually
going INTO space, right?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.945
No, silly! I'm
dropping you two off

11:21.047 --> 11:22.380
as soon as we're
close to the fans.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.850
Then I'M going
into space!

11:30.590 --> 11:32.757
You're up to
something, Twily...

11:33.159 --> 11:35.560
Nope. Just looking
at the flowers.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.196
[sniff] Ahhh.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.231
Right.....

11:44.705 --> 11:47.672
Ooh! Maybe Rarity's
plan WILL work!

11:47.774 --> 11:51.042
Canterlot, we have a problem!

11:53.814 --> 11:55.647
I know that one's
a crowd favorite.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.648
What's say we play
it one more time?

11:57.718 --> 11:59.084
And a one, and a two and a --

12:04.958 --> 12:06.557
A distraction's a distraction.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.000
Where's Spike
and Fluttershy?

12:16.102 --> 12:17.569
Did they make it
into the castle?

12:17.771 --> 12:22.373
They jumped out right before
the balloon went TBBBTHHHH.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.076
But that's all I could see
without being in space.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.145
Where I didn't get to go.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.882
Let's hope Rarity and Rainbow
Dash had better luck.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.488
What's this? CLOSED!?

12:36.590 --> 12:38.390
Heh. The Seedy Juice Joint
is always closed

12:38.492 --> 12:39.591
around this time.

12:39.693 --> 12:42.193
Then how are we meant to shake
down Ne'er Do Wells

12:42.295 --> 12:43.562
for information!?

12:43.864 --> 12:45.530
What sort of
information do you need?

12:45.732 --> 12:47.866
Um, the location to
a secret entrance

12:47.968 --> 12:50.135
to the passages under
Canterlot Castle?

12:50.537 --> 12:51.569
You mean that one?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.273
Yes. Thank you.
That will do nicely.

13:01.814 --> 13:03.682
Zephyr Breeze!?

13:04.684 --> 13:09.354
Oh, ho ho ho, darling; this
couldn't be more perfect...

13:10.156 --> 13:11.556
How is this perfect!?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.758
He's the most annoying
pony in Equestria,

13:13.860 --> 13:15.527
and he's totally
obsessed with me,

13:15.629 --> 13:17.763
and we have to come up
with a way to distract-

13:18.865 --> 13:22.400
Oh, no! No way! Uh, uh!

13:27.507 --> 13:30.275
Wha-? Rainbow! I knew
you'd come running

13:30.377 --> 13:31.776
when you heard I
got this job.

13:31.878 --> 13:34.579
The mares love a pony
in uniform, am I right?

13:34.681 --> 13:35.847
Not really...

13:40.653 --> 13:43.254
I mean, uh... totally!

13:43.356 --> 13:45.423
Why don't you.. step
into the light

13:45.525 --> 13:49.928
so I can see how
[groan] <i>handsome</i> you look in it?

14:01.408 --> 14:04.542
I told the Sarge that gold
kinda clashes with my aura,

14:04.644 --> 14:06.844
but apparently, they
aren't big on "input".

14:06.946 --> 14:09.380
Still, I totally manage
to rock the look,

14:09.482 --> 14:10.115
don't you think?

14:10.517 --> 14:14.419
Yep. You're real
guard material...

14:14.521 --> 14:17.055
I'm part of the castle team
now, so I'm basically...

14:17.457 --> 14:19.323
Whoa, we got a swooner!

14:20.627 --> 14:22.126
It's good you're
finally being honest

14:22.228 --> 14:23.762
with your feelings
for me, Rainbows.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.130
[gag] Yech!

14:25.432 --> 14:27.131
The truth is such a gift.

14:27.233 --> 14:30.301
Like, I had to follow my bliss
to see guarding is my calling.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.871
Like look at me go. I'm going
to walk over here and I go woo!

14:32.973 --> 14:34.072
Over there! And I go yeah!

14:34.174 --> 14:36.058
And sometimes I just stand
like this and look real cool

14:36.159 --> 14:37.143
and I go down the
hallway going...

14:37.267 --> 14:38.867
Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

14:48.254 --> 14:48.987
Phew.

14:49.089 --> 14:52.590
We'll have to glide to
the throne. No flapping.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.574
Sister! <i>Another</i> false alarm

15:09.676 --> 15:11.942
from Shining
Armor's guard geese!

15:14.781 --> 15:15.980
We should have heard by now.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.515
Something must have gone wrong!

15:17.617 --> 15:19.283
Pinkie: Probably
several somethings.

15:22.388 --> 15:24.155
No lookout, no distraction,

15:24.257 --> 15:26.090
and no word from
the ponies inside!

15:26.192 --> 15:28.059
I'm starting to think
this whole operation

15:28.161 --> 15:29.794
might be a giant flop.

15:38.038 --> 15:38.838
Oh, no!

15:40.040 --> 15:41.056
Gee, Fluttershy,

15:41.157 --> 15:42.873
I thought your whole
"small spaces" thing

15:42.976 --> 15:44.909
was just part of the
plan to be unexpected.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.545
Once I got trapped in the
Castle of the Two Sisters,

15:47.647 --> 15:49.714
and Angel Bunny and
I were separated.

15:49.816 --> 15:52.917
Now whenever I'm in a tiny room,
it's all I can think about!

15:53.019 --> 15:56.154
I was so worried he felt
alone and forgotten.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.356
I know what
that's like...

15:58.758 --> 15:59.958
What do you mean?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.961
I was always excited to
be a part of Twilight's

16:03.063 --> 16:06.064
and Shining Armor's rivalry,
like I was their little brother,

16:06.399 --> 16:08.733
but they never really
thought of me that way.

16:08.935 --> 16:12.337
I know they both have a special
place in their heart for you,

16:12.639 --> 16:15.740
but sibling dynamics
are hard. Trust me.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.675
Right. Zephyr Breeze.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.944
Honestly, he could
learn a lot from you

16:20.046 --> 16:21.279
about being a
little brother.

16:23.383 --> 16:26.417
I am sick of being lost
in these slimy corridors too,

16:26.519 --> 16:28.886
but you shouldn't pull every
lever you come across!

16:28.988 --> 16:30.521
Half of them are traps!

16:30.623 --> 16:33.091
And the other half might
open a secret passage

16:33.193 --> 16:34.225
to the castle!

16:34.327 --> 16:36.260
IT'S NOT
WORTH THE RISK!

16:36.361 --> 16:37.194
Oh, hello, Spike.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.397
Even if we did find our
way back to the castle,

16:39.499 --> 16:41.198
we'd still have all
of those guards--

16:41.367 --> 16:42.767
SPIKE? FLUTTERSHY!

16:44.237 --> 16:46.437
W-What are you guys
doing down here?

16:46.639 --> 16:48.739
We er.. kind of fell
through the floor.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.642
I don't think our
plan is working.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.443
If we've both
hit dead ends,

16:52.545 --> 16:56.080
perhaps we should return to
the outside and revaluate.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.984
Ech!

17:04.357 --> 17:05.389
Psssst!

17:08.895 --> 17:10.361
What are you all doing out here?

17:10.497 --> 17:14.666
In retrospect, our plan might
have been too unexpected.

17:14.768 --> 17:19.337
[gasp] Every part of it failed? Oh,
now I'll never get the crown!

17:20.240 --> 17:23.274
Maybe we should go back to
doing things the Twilight way.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.410
You mean, the
totally expected way?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.162
It may not be a surprise,

17:27.263 --> 17:29.413
but you have a pretty good
record for planning things.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.686
Then I guess it's worth
a try. Thanks, Spike.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.687
What are little
brothers for?

17:36.789 --> 17:39.457
OK. You all know
what to do!

17:58.711 --> 18:00.344
At least one part of
our unexpected plan

18:00.446 --> 18:01.412
worked unexpectedly.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.128
To be fair, it was never made
specifically clear to me

18:17.230 --> 18:20.965
what "guarding" actually
means. So this is on you.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.704
I'm strong, Twilight,
but not even I

18:26.806 --> 18:28.573
can buck through solid rock.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.075
That's why I brought
a specialist.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.592
[deep voice] Next shift. You're on break.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.843
You've been
glaring so hard!

19:06.045 --> 19:08.512
Who wants a feather massage?

19:10.517 --> 19:12.817
We mapped this out when
we got lost down here.

19:13.086 --> 19:16.654
The lever to the secret
hallway entrance should be...

19:16.756 --> 19:17.455
Here.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.130
I can't believe this worked!

19:25.532 --> 19:28.067
I guess sometimes the best
plan is the one you expect.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.070
All I have to do now is fly
over and take the crown,

19:32.172 --> 19:34.672
and I'll be Sibling
Supreme forever!

19:35.174 --> 19:36.907
Not exactly.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.878
Oh, come on!

19:40.380 --> 19:42.747
Gotta admit, it was
unexpected for you to do

19:42.849 --> 19:45.950
everything exactly how
I thought you would.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.086
But you should know
by now there's no way

19:48.188 --> 19:51.055
to beat the true
SIBLING SUPREME!

19:51.357 --> 19:53.891
I am sorry, Twilight,
but it looks as though

19:53.993 --> 19:56.928
Shining Armor has
truly won the crown.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.796
Spike: That's the thing about looks...

19:59.198 --> 20:01.266
...they can be deceiving!

20:01.668 --> 20:02.767
Spike!?

20:02.869 --> 20:05.036
How in Equestria
did you do it!?

20:05.238 --> 20:07.405
Come on. You two don't
think you have the only

20:07.507 --> 20:10.642
sibling rivalry. I had
an inside pony help.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.346
It wasn't hard to miss
there was some disagreement

20:15.448 --> 20:17.415
on the whole "security" thing.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.151
Luna: I said we could
do it ourselves,

20:20.253 --> 20:23.354
but some ponies are
a bit more stubborn...

20:23.556 --> 20:25.957
<i> So, while Shining</i>
<i> Armor went on and on</i>

20:26.059 --> 20:28.159
<i> about all his improved</i>
<i> security measures,</i>

20:28.261 --> 20:30.228
<i> Luna and I struck a deal.</i>

20:30.363 --> 20:32.430
<i> She put Zephyr in</i>
<i> charge of the catacombs</i>

20:32.532 --> 20:34.832
<i> and helped keep Celestia</i>
<i> out of the castle hallways.</i>

20:35.001 --> 20:38.402
<i> Once Luna was on board, I</i>
<i> just had to do my part...</i>

20:38.871 --> 20:40.938
<i> ...and make sure we</i>
<i> stuck to Twilight's plan,</i>

20:41.140 --> 20:43.674
<i> so we'd all get to the throne</i>
<i> room at the same time.</i>

20:43.976 --> 20:45.843
<i> I knew Shining Armor</i>
<i> would let it play out</i>

20:45.945 --> 20:47.612
<i> until the last</i>
<i> possible second.</i>

20:47.680 --> 20:50.314
<i> Then, while everyone was</i>
<i> distracted by his gloating,</i>

20:50.516 --> 20:54.151
<i> all Luna had to do was</i>
<i> float the crown.. over to me.</i>

20:57.290 --> 20:58.189
Ahem.

20:58.391 --> 21:02.727
I er.. apologize for not listening
to your concerns, sister.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.462
It seems we need
to make adjustments

21:04.564 --> 21:08.198
to account for threats <i>inside</i>
the castle as well as out.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.667
If you agree..?

21:09.769 --> 21:12.470
If you think it's
worth discussing...

21:13.172 --> 21:17.475
So... if Twilight and
Shining Armor failed...

21:17.677 --> 21:18.943
who gets the crown?

21:21.147 --> 21:24.915
The TRUE Sibling Supreme. Spike.

21:25.117 --> 21:25.783
Huh?

21:25.885 --> 21:28.086
The little brother...
we've always had!
