00:04.300 --> 00:07.571
Calling all pegasus ponies!
Meeting tonight!

00:14.801 --> 00:18.124
Mandatory meeting
for all Ponyville pegasi.

00:18.825 --> 00:22.321
Library, tonight.
Be cool, or be mule.

00:23.322 --> 00:24.422
No offense.

00:24.823 --> 00:26.000
None taken.

00:30.470 --> 00:32.901
Alright, go on in, find a seat.

00:38.451 --> 00:40.186
You too, Fluttershy.

00:44.391 --> 00:45.924
Come on, let's go.

00:50.457 --> 00:55.457
Season 2 | Episode 22

01:30.772 --> 01:35.031
<i>Every living thing depends on
the life-giving nourishment of rainwater.</i>

01:35.182 --> 01:38.681
<i>And it is up to Cloudsdale
to provide rain-filled clouds</i>

01:38.832 --> 01:41.042
<i>to every corner of Equestria.</i>

01:41.193 --> 01:45.914
<i>But how, one pony might ask,
does Cloudsdale gather all this extra water?</i>

01:46.515 --> 01:48.558
<i>Tornado power!</i>

01:48.709 --> 01:52.100
<i>That's right, pegasi-driven tornado power.</i>

01:52.251 --> 01:56.935
<i>A team of pegasi combine their wing power
to create a jumbo tornado,</i>

01:57.086 --> 02:00.241
<i>powerful enough to pull water
out of the local reservoir,</i>

02:00.392 --> 02:03.381
<i>and funnel it all the way up to Cloudsdale.</i>

02:03.532 --> 02:06.421
<i>Remember, pegasi,
your jumbo tornado</i>

02:06.572 --> 02:09.666
<i>must reach a minimum of
eight hundred wing power</i>

02:09.817 --> 02:12.137
<i>to lift that water up to Cloudsdale.</i>

02:13.388 --> 02:15.341
<i>So, the next time you're wondering</i>

02:15.492 --> 02:17.666
<i>"Where does all that extra
rainwater come from?"</i>

02:17.817 --> 02:19.281
<i>just rememb-</i>

02:24.531 --> 02:27.105
Uh... intermission?

02:27.256 --> 02:28.656
So, here's the scoop.

02:28.807 --> 02:31.547
Cloudsdale has chosen
our own highland reservoir

02:31.698 --> 02:34.393
as a source of the rainwater
they need for all of Equestria.

02:34.544 --> 02:36.144
And you know what that means.

02:36.295 --> 02:40.081
It means it's up to Ponyville's pegasi
to bring that water up to Cloudsdale.

02:41.836 --> 02:45.081
Not only that, but Spitfire,
captain of the Wonderbolts,

02:45.232 --> 02:48.813
will be here to oversee the water transfer
and record our top tornado windspeed.

02:48.964 --> 02:51.631
Now last year, Fillydelphia
broke the windspeed record

02:51.782 --> 02:54.341
with a top speed of
nine hundred and ten wing power.

02:54.492 --> 02:56.177
But I think we can do better.

02:56.328 --> 02:59.411
I think we can get a top speed
over a thousand!

03:01.362 --> 03:05.281
IF each and every pony trains,
and trains hard

03:05.432 --> 03:07.363
to get their wing power numbers up.

03:08.652 --> 03:11.928
That coughing better be from
a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane.

03:12.079 --> 03:13.911
Nopony's getting sick on my watch.

03:14.062 --> 03:16.461
So, are we gonna train hard?

03:16.612 --> 03:17.512
Yeah!

03:17.813 --> 03:19.531
Are we gonna be strong?

03:19.682 --> 03:20.682
Yeah!

03:20.833 --> 03:22.333
Are we gonna be fast?

03:22.484 --> 03:23.884
Yeah!

03:24.335 --> 03:26.165
Record-smashing fast?

03:26.166 --> 03:27.266
Yeah!

03:27.567 --> 03:30.101
Who's with me?

03:36.180 --> 03:37.624
Fluttershy!

03:41.781 --> 03:43.531
Stretch those glutes, Flitter!

03:43.682 --> 03:45.821
Nice flexibility, Cloudchaser.

03:45.972 --> 03:48.434
A little too much flexibility,
Blossomforth.

03:48.585 --> 03:50.820
Somepony give Blossomforth a hoof.

03:50.971 --> 03:53.302
Let's see some faster trotting,
Thunderlane!

03:54.303 --> 03:55.965
Good pace, Silverspeed!

03:57.872 --> 03:58.781
Keep it up!

03:58.932 --> 04:01.926
We're gonna need all the wing power
we can get to break that record!

04:02.077 --> 04:03.377
Yeah!

04:04.981 --> 04:06.545
Good work, everypony!

04:07.146 --> 04:10.008
Everypony except Fluttershy.

04:12.316 --> 04:14.851
Fluttershy? I know you're in there!

04:15.002 --> 04:17.511
You're avoiding tornado duty
and I want to know why!

04:17.762 --> 04:19.062
Fluttershy, open-

04:24.531 --> 04:25.869
Hi, Rainbow Dash.

04:27.020 --> 04:28.732
Fluttershy, what happened to you?

04:28.883 --> 04:32.601
Oh, I...
I think I have the pony pox.

04:32.752 --> 04:36.931
I'm sorry, I really, really wanted
to come to training day today...

04:38.304 --> 04:41.131
But this pony pox has really
knocked me for a loop.

04:42.834 --> 04:45.034
Oh, you poor thing.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.969
You know, there's only
one cure for pony pox.

04:48.198 --> 04:50.457
I know, plenty of bed-

04:51.499 --> 04:53.091
Cold water!

04:53.242 --> 04:55.868
Those pony pox are clearing right up.

04:56.319 --> 05:00.094
Y'know, all of a sudden I'm,
I'm starting to feel better.

05:00.245 --> 05:02.547
I'll just get out of these robes and-

05:04.287 --> 05:08.034
My wing, oh ow, it's hurt.
I guess I can't fly after all.

05:09.426 --> 05:11.081
Messed up wing, huh?

05:13.055 --> 05:17.131
Stop horsing around, Fluttershy.
We've got a lot of training to do.

05:17.282 --> 05:19.301
Come on now, what's going on?

05:19.452 --> 05:22.273
Well, y'see, uh, well...

05:22.581 --> 05:26.286
Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!
I can't fly!

05:26.437 --> 05:27.950
What are you talking about?

05:28.101 --> 05:30.460
Just last week you went into
that wicked nose dive

05:30.611 --> 05:32.951
to save that falling baby bird
right before it hit the ground!

05:33.102 --> 05:35.584
But that was different,
that was an emergency!

05:35.735 --> 05:39.101
This whole tornado thing,
it's more like a performance.

05:39.252 --> 05:42.037
And you know how I hate performing
in front of others.

05:42.188 --> 05:43.989
Don't you remember flight camp?

05:44.140 --> 05:46.389
I couldn't gallop hard, or fly fast.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.692
Not with everypony looking at me!

05:49.093 --> 05:50.651
It wasn't that bad.

05:50.802 --> 05:53.294
You're right, Rainbow Dash,
it wasn't bad.

05:53.445 --> 05:55.131
<i>It was horrible!</i>

06:06.331 --> 06:08.585
<i>All the other foals
used to tease me</i>

06:08.736 --> 06:10.036
<i>a lot!</i>

06:10.187 --> 06:14.821
<i>Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly!</i>

06:17.631 --> 06:20.481
I just can't risk that
sort of humiliation again.

06:20.632 --> 06:23.964
Suck it up, Fluttershy!
This is no time for-

06:24.480 --> 06:27.431
I mean, confidence or no confidence,

06:27.581 --> 06:31.929
I'm gonna need every pegasus
to break the record, including you.

06:32.080 --> 06:35.039
I need every ounce of wing power
I can get.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.523
I don't think so, Rainbow Dash...

06:40.339 --> 06:41.631
Thanks anyway.

06:45.081 --> 06:45.951
Wait.

06:46.502 --> 06:47.702
I'll do it.

06:47.853 --> 06:49.491
- You will?
- I will.

06:49.642 --> 06:52.102
- You're game?
- I'm game.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.008
Alright!

07:01.723 --> 07:03.533
What exactly does this machine do?

07:03.684 --> 07:05.438
This is an anemometer.

07:05.589 --> 07:08.567
It measures your accelerative velocity
and translates it into wing power.

07:08.718 --> 07:12.048
Thus gauging your cumulative H2O
anti-gravitational potential.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.113
Any other questions?

07:14.564 --> 07:15.564
Yeah.

07:15.715 --> 07:17.742
What exactly does this machine do?

07:18.613 --> 07:21.745
It tells you how fast you're flying
and how strong your wings are.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.713
Is that you again, Thunderlane?

07:28.864 --> 07:32.359
Please, we need to have
a germ-free environment.

07:32.510 --> 07:34.593
It wasn't me, it was Blossomforth.

07:34.744 --> 07:36.324
Don't worry, Twilight.

07:36.475 --> 07:40.063
Thunder Lane is just cooking up an excuse
to spend tornado day in bed.

07:40.214 --> 07:43.563
Why don't you get over here
and be our first test flier, Thunderlane?

07:54.404 --> 07:56.660
We have 9.3 wing power.

07:56.811 --> 07:58.760
Wow! That's fast!

07:59.211 --> 08:00.360
Yeah!

08:01.163 --> 08:02.933
Not bad...not bad.

08:22.665 --> 08:25.025
16.5 wing power!

08:28.513 --> 08:29.704
Now listen up!

08:29.855 --> 08:32.943
If each of you can get your numbers
up to at least 10.0 wing power

08:33.094 --> 08:34.094
by the end of the week,

08:34.245 --> 08:36.571
we'll no doubt set
a new tornado speed record.

08:36.722 --> 08:38.022
We'll be number one!

09:05.976 --> 09:08.602
Impressive.
Fluttershy, your turn.

09:27.678 --> 09:32.124
Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly...

09:40.668 --> 09:42.795
- Tell her!
- No, you tell her!

09:42.946 --> 09:44.046
No, you!

09:45.438 --> 09:50.587
Great job, Fluttershy!
You measured... point five.

09:51.188 --> 09:54.642
Point five? Isn't that like...
less than one?

09:56.517 --> 10:00.964
<i>Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly!</i>

10:09.912 --> 10:11.498
Fluttershy, wait!

10:11.649 --> 10:15.892
So some punks poked a little fun at you
and you got stage fright, big deal.

10:16.043 --> 10:18.457
You aren't gonna go quit
just because of that, are you?

10:18.858 --> 10:20.898
Yes!

10:22.452 --> 10:24.246
But I need you!

10:24.397 --> 10:28.935
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just
don't have the courage right now...

10:55.106 --> 10:58.711
Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid
a couple of little acorns won't solve

10:58.862 --> 11:00.748
my big flying problem.

11:02.768 --> 11:06.767
I tried, but you should've seen
those ponies laughing at me...

11:08.168 --> 11:11.367
I know it's important
to have confidence in myself...

11:13.212 --> 11:17.159
Yes, yes, I do remember.
The river was swelling...

11:18.768 --> 11:20.603
... and you were scared.

11:21.368 --> 11:24.420
Yes, I did tell you to never give up

11:26.068 --> 11:28.478
and to believe in yourself.

11:29.398 --> 11:31.833
You're right, my friends.
I shouldn't give up.

11:31.834 --> 11:36.253
I will get my confidence up and show
everypony that I am a good flyer!

11:38.508 --> 11:40.868
A great flyer!

13:02.238 --> 13:05.288
That's wonderful, Flitter.
Much better than yesterday.

13:05.439 --> 13:09.068
This is crazy awesome!
We're gonna smash that record!

13:10.817 --> 13:11.838
What'd he say?

13:11.989 --> 13:14.128
Do I look like I speak squirrel?

13:14.479 --> 13:15.901
What's that?

13:34.919 --> 13:38.738
Two point three? Two point three?!

13:38.889 --> 13:40.818
That has to be some kind of mistake!

13:40.969 --> 13:42.903
I worked so hard!

13:43.054 --> 13:45.612
Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!

13:45.763 --> 13:48.282
You did awesome, Fluttershy.

13:48.433 --> 13:51.508
No I didn't. I thought I'd
gotten over my nerves,

13:51.659 --> 13:53.501
but they still got the best of me!

13:53.652 --> 13:57.269
There's no way I'll fly with
10.0 wing power tomorrow!

13:57.420 --> 13:59.370
So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power.

13:59.521 --> 14:01.134
Every bit counts!

14:01.285 --> 14:04.633
How would you feel if everypony
else was flying with 10.0 wing power

14:04.784 --> 14:07.382
and you were flying with 2.5?

14:07.968 --> 14:10.485
Actually, it was only 2.3, and- ow!

14:12.511 --> 14:15.434
Well, uh... I'd feel...

14:15.585 --> 14:18.898
Exactly! Humiliated!

14:19.049 --> 14:22.168
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash,
I just can't do it!

14:23.218 --> 14:24.465
It's okay, Rainbow Dash.

14:24.616 --> 14:26.518
You've still got plenty of
wing power for your tornado.

14:26.669 --> 14:29.218
You'll be able to lift tons of water up
to Cloudsdale!

14:31.300 --> 14:35.468
If only there was a way to lift
Fluttershy out of the dumps...

14:49.781 --> 14:51.615
Are we ready to do this?

14:56.918 --> 14:57.785
Look!

14:59.185 --> 15:01.829
Lazy Thunderlane!
Where is he?!

15:01.980 --> 15:04.737
He's been trying to get out
of tornado duty the whole time

15:04.888 --> 15:06.282
with his fake coughing and all.

15:06.433 --> 15:08.125
Rumble, where's your lazy brother?

15:08.276 --> 15:09.662
He's got the feather flu.

15:09.813 --> 15:11.609
He's down at Ponyville hospital.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.866
But he's not the only one.

15:16.995 --> 15:20.554
Let's see, with those eight sick pegasi
out with the feather flu...

15:21.155 --> 15:21.825
Oh no!

15:21.976 --> 15:24.675
Don't tell me we won't be able
to break the windspeed record?

15:24.826 --> 15:25.826
No...

15:27.565 --> 15:30.605
You might not have enough wing power
to create a tornado powerful enough

15:30.756 --> 15:33.015
to lift the water to Cloudsdale!

15:33.166 --> 15:35.611
Well, should we pack up?

15:40.561 --> 15:43.390
No. Of course not.
Forget the record.

15:43.641 --> 15:45.800
Cloudsdale still needs water!

15:46.421 --> 15:49.265
Okay, everypony,
let's give it all we've got!

15:50.465 --> 15:52.758
On the sound of the horn, we take off!

16:08.429 --> 16:10.815
You think they're gonna make it
to eight hundred wing power?

16:10.966 --> 16:12.225
I sure hope so!

16:12.376 --> 16:14.209
One hundred and fifty wing power.

16:14.460 --> 16:16.179
Two hundred and fifty wing power.

16:18.762 --> 16:20.294
Five hundred wing power!

16:22.938 --> 16:25.933
Seven hundred and fifty wing power!

16:26.084 --> 16:27.084
Twilight!

16:27.335 --> 16:30.590
Fluttershy! What are you doing here?!

16:31.525 --> 16:34.759
I figured, if I couldn't help
Rainbow Dash with the tornado,

16:34.910 --> 16:37.305
the least I could do
was offer moral support!

16:37.456 --> 16:40.141
She could sure use it,
considering eight pegasi

16:40.292 --> 16:42.155
are sick with the feather flu!

16:42.306 --> 16:44.750
Oh no! That's terrible news!

17:06.042 --> 17:07.690
Are you okay?

17:07.841 --> 17:09.041
I'm fine!

17:09.865 --> 17:12.737
You were so close to the
eight hundred wing power minimum!

17:12.888 --> 17:14.999
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.

17:16.802 --> 17:19.186
We've got to try again!

17:19.337 --> 17:21.733
But you've pushed your crew
to their limit already!

17:21.884 --> 17:24.621
If you break apart again,
somepony could get hurt!

17:24.772 --> 17:26.965
You should quit, it's not safe!

17:27.116 --> 17:29.139
No! One more time!

17:29.290 --> 17:31.069
I've gotta know we gave it our all!

17:31.220 --> 17:34.679
If I'm going down, I'm going down flying!

17:35.522 --> 17:38.679
C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!

17:40.703 --> 17:41.999
Yeah!

17:49.615 --> 17:51.603
Okay, here we go...

17:51.754 --> 17:53.630
One hundred wing power!

17:54.305 --> 17:57.095
Two hundred... five hundred!

17:57.446 --> 17:59.561
Stay in position!

17:59.712 --> 18:02.156
Flap those wings! Faster!

18:02.757 --> 18:04.399
Seven hundred!

18:07.225 --> 18:09.836
Seven hundred and fifty wing power!

18:12.253 --> 18:14.628
They fell apart right after this!

18:14.779 --> 18:16.945
I'm too nervous to look!

18:18.265 --> 18:21.403
C'mon! Just a little harder!

18:21.554 --> 18:24.565
I can see the water
trying to funnel through!

18:24.716 --> 18:27.758
Seven ninety five! We are so close!

18:27.909 --> 18:30.324
Fluttershy, they need you up there!

18:30.475 --> 18:32.965
I won't make a difference!

18:33.116 --> 18:35.191
You can make a difference!

18:35.342 --> 18:40.198
My measly 2.3 wing power
is still too little!

18:40.349 --> 18:42.491
It's sticking at seven ninety five!

18:42.642 --> 18:44.398
I don't know if they've got
any more in 'em!

18:44.549 --> 18:47.844
Do it for Equestria!
Do it for Rainbow Dash!

18:47.995 --> 18:49.620
Do it for yourself!

19:17.765 --> 19:20.075
It's moving!
She's doing it!

19:23.691 --> 19:25.115
Seven ninety eight!

19:25.266 --> 19:27.872
She surpassed her best
wing power number!

19:33.765 --> 19:38.335
<i>Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly!</i>

19:39.853 --> 19:40.948
No!

19:42.537 --> 19:43.700
What was that?

19:43.851 --> 19:45.975
I think it was Fluttershy!

19:59.685 --> 20:03.815
She did it! She did it!
They all did it!

20:29.575 --> 20:31.467
Whoa, girl, take it easy!

20:31.618 --> 20:34.365
Whuh, what? Did we do it?

20:34.516 --> 20:37.552
Yeah, we did it!
You did it!

20:41.328 --> 20:44.125
Great job, Fluttershy,
that was awesome!

20:44.276 --> 20:46.575
Yeah, we couldn't have done it
without you.

20:46.726 --> 20:47.926
Nice job, Rainbow Dash.

20:48.077 --> 20:51.265
You may not have set a new record,
but you showed a lot of guts.

20:51.701 --> 20:52.650
Thanks.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.537
But if you wanna talk guts,
then you've gotta give it

20:55.688 --> 20:58.603
to my number one flyer,
Fluttershy!

20:59.176 --> 21:01.515
Let's hear it for Fluttershy!

21:01.916 --> 21:06.264
Fluttershy! Fluttershy!
Fluttershy can really fly!

21:09.525 --> 21:11.173
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

21:11.324 --> 21:13.702
<i>sometimes you can feel like
what you have to offer</i>

21:13.853 --> 21:16.167
<i>is too little to make a difference.</i>

21:16.318 --> 21:20.205
<i>But today, I learned that
everypony's contribution is important.</i>

21:20.356 --> 21:21.795
<i>No matter how small.</i>

21:21.946 --> 21:27.265
<i>If you just keep your head high,

21:27.416 --> 21:29.374
