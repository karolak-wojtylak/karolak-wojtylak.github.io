WEBVTT

00:06.623 --> 00:10.220
Come on, Twilight. We're gonna be late
for the Nightmare Night Festival.

00:13.383 --> 00:14.318
Huh?

00:15.314 --> 00:16.531
Are you...

00:16.532 --> 00:20.602
...that one creaky grandpa
from Ponyville Retirement Village?

00:20.912 --> 00:22.975
I'm Star Swirl the Bearded.

00:24.338 --> 00:26.751
Father of the omnimorphic spell?

00:27.905 --> 00:31.615
Did you even read that book I gave you
about obscure unicorn history?

00:31.616 --> 00:32.764
Um...

00:33.521 --> 00:34.679
That sounds important!

00:37.326 --> 00:42.381
<i>Nightmare Night! What a fright!
Give us something sweet to bite!</i>

00:44.543 --> 00:47.404
Hi, everypony. Great costumes.

00:47.405 --> 00:49.212
Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith.

00:49.213 --> 00:52.581
I should have been
asleep five hours ago.

01:01.478 --> 01:06.108
Pipsqueak the Pirate, at your service.
It's my very first Nightmare Night.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.985
Since you moved here from Trottingham?

01:07.986 --> 01:11.909
No. My very first Nightmare Night ever!

01:12.463 --> 01:14.560
Enough chitchat! Time is candy!

01:14.561 --> 01:17.116
Pinkie Pie, aren't you
a little old for this?

01:17.117 --> 01:19.191
Too old for free candy?

01:19.608 --> 01:20.755
Never!

01:27.236 --> 01:28.582
Do you like it?

01:29.416 --> 01:31.516
Yeah! Great costume, Twilight.

01:31.517 --> 01:34.045
Oh, you make a fantastic weirdo clown.

01:35.308 --> 01:36.863
A clown?!

01:38.890 --> 01:41.197
Look at the borders on these robes.

01:41.198 --> 01:42.832
These are hoof-stitched!

01:42.833 --> 01:44.479
It's a great costume.

01:45.032 --> 01:46.362
...grandpa.

02:27.505 --> 02:32.147
Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most
important conjurer of the pre-classical era.

02:35.348 --> 02:37.778
He created more than two hundred spells.

02:37.779 --> 02:41.560
He even has a shelf in the Canterlot
library of magic named after him.

02:43.238 --> 02:46.671
Maybe I should start up a pony group
to teach ponies of our history.

02:46.672 --> 02:49.671
I bet everypony would love it.
Don't you, Spike?

02:51.254 --> 02:52.432
I love it.

02:54.085 --> 02:55.696
Hey, look. We're here already.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.279
Should we get something to eat?

02:59.196 --> 03:01.731
Twilight! Twilight! Look at our haul!

03:01.788 --> 03:03.074
Can you believe it?

03:06.597 --> 03:09.563
And then we went to Cheerilee's house
and we got a bunch more goodies.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.991
-Didn't we, Pip?
-Sure did!

03:10.992 --> 03:12.729
And then we had to stop and wait
for Granny Smith and...

03:17.466 --> 03:20.090
Rainbow Dash! That wasn't very nice.

03:20.091 --> 03:23.987
Lighten up, old-timer. This is
the best night of the year for pranks.

03:23.988 --> 03:25.759
Look what you did to Spike.

03:27.449 --> 03:28.888
Aw, it's all in good fun.

03:28.889 --> 03:30.806
Oh! Oh! There's another group over there!

03:44.963 --> 03:46.982
Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack.

03:46.983 --> 03:50.467
Howdy, Spike. Hey, Twilight.
Nice costume.

03:50.468 --> 03:52.369
Thanks! I'm a dragon.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.179
She means me, Spike.

03:54.180 --> 03:57.483
With that beard, I reckon you're
some sorta country music singer.

03:58.299 --> 04:01.210
While y'all are here, you feel like
bobbin' for an apple?

04:07.482 --> 04:09.198
Thank you, everypony.

04:09.199 --> 04:12.344
And welcome to
the Nightmare Night Festival.

04:14.579 --> 04:17.630
Now, all the little ponies, who
have been out collecting sweets...

04:17.631 --> 04:21.870
...should follow our friend Zecora
to hear the legend of...

04:22.035 --> 04:24.686
Nightmare Moooon!

04:27.214 --> 04:30.566
Spooky voice might work better
if she wasn't dressed like that.

04:38.127 --> 04:43.444
Follow me and very soon
You'll hear the tale of Nightmare Moon.

04:45.946 --> 04:50.707
Listen close, my little dears.
I'll tell you where you got your fears.

04:50.984 --> 04:53.874
Of Nightmare Night, so dark and scary.

04:55.989 --> 04:59.259
Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary.

05:02.570 --> 05:07.515
Every year we put on a disguise
To save ourselves from her searching eyes.

05:10.492 --> 05:14.036
The Nightmare Moon wants just one thing:

05:15.762 --> 05:19.140
To gobble up ponies in one quick swing!

05:21.076 --> 05:26.859
Hungrily she soars the sky.
If she sees nopony, she passes by.

05:26.860 --> 05:32.395
So if she comes and all is clear,
Equestria is safe another year!

05:33.943 --> 05:36.363
Um... Miss Zecora.

05:36.364 --> 05:39.469
If we wear costumes to hide
from Nightmare Moon...

05:39.470 --> 05:41.392
...so she won't gobble us up...

05:41.393 --> 05:44.696
...how come we still need to
give her some of our candy?

05:44.697 --> 05:50.639
A perfect question, my little friend!
For Nightmare Moon you must not offend.

05:51.705 --> 05:53.980
Fill up her belly with a treat or two...

05:54.080 --> 05:58.108
So she won't return to come eat YOUUU!

06:00.258 --> 06:02.945
Everypony! Just dump some
candy and get outta here!

06:26.644 --> 06:28.591
IT'S NIGHTMARE MOON! RUUUN!!!

06:59.367 --> 07:01.092
Princess Luna!

07:13.426 --> 07:16.263
CITIZENS OF PONYVILLE!

07:16.769 --> 07:20.310
WE HAVE GRACED YOUR TINY
VILLAGE WITH OUR PRESENCE...

07:20.311 --> 07:25.886
...SO THAT YOU MIGHT BEHOLD
THE REAL PRINCESS OF THE NIGHT!

07:25.887 --> 07:29.135
A CREATURE OF NIGHTMARE IS
NO LONGER, BUT INSTEAD...

07:29.136 --> 07:32.775
...A PONY WHO DESIRES
YOUR LOVE AND ADMIRATION.

07:32.776 --> 07:35.639
TOGETHER WE SHALL CHANGE
THIS DREADFUL CELEBRATION...

07:35.640 --> 07:39.712
...INTO A BRIGHT AND
GLORIOUS FEEEAST!

07:41.225 --> 07:42.414
Did you hear that, everypony?

07:42.415 --> 07:45.338
Nightmare Moon says
she's gonna feast on us all!

07:49.999 --> 07:50.944
What?!

07:50.945 --> 07:55.474
No, children, no! You no longer
have reason to fear us.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.304
Screams of delight is
what your princess desires.

07:58.305 --> 08:00.406
Not screams of terror.

08:02.458 --> 08:03.781
Madame Mayor.

08:03.782 --> 08:07.296
Thy princess of the night hath arrived.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.761
What is the matter with you?

08:19.471 --> 08:21.683
Very well then! Be that way!

08:21.883 --> 08:25.034
We won't even bother with
the traditional royal farewell.

08:25.957 --> 08:27.689
I'm gonna go talk to her.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.634
You can't talk to her!
She's Nightmare Moon!

08:30.635 --> 08:31.888
No, she's not.

08:31.889 --> 08:34.989
I saw the Elements of Harmony
change her back to good.

08:34.990 --> 08:37.142
But it seems like she's having
some trouble adjusting...

08:37.143 --> 08:39.717
...after being gone
for a thousand years.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.957
Princess Luna?

08:48.665 --> 08:50.115
Hi. My name is...

08:50.116 --> 08:51.679
Star Swirl the Bearded.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.678
Commendable costume.
Thou even got the bells right.

08:54.679 --> 08:58.996
Thank you, finally! Somepony
who gets my costume.

09:00.852 --> 09:04.277
Uh... I just came to welcome you
to our celebration.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.923
My actual name is...

09:05.924 --> 09:07.097
Twilight Sparkle.

09:07.929 --> 09:10.887
IT WAS THOU WHO UNLEASHED
THE POWERS OF HARMONY UPON US...

09:10.888 --> 09:13.314
...AND TOOK AWAY OUR DARK POWERS!

09:14.805 --> 09:17.145
And that was a good thing, right?

09:17.146 --> 09:19.790
But of course! We
could not be happier.

09:19.791 --> 09:21.059
Is that not clear?!

09:21.060 --> 09:23.939
Well, you kind of sound
like you're yelling at me.

09:23.940 --> 09:26.981
But this is the traditional
royal Canterlot voice.

09:26.982 --> 09:29.870
It is tradition to speak
using the royal "we"...

09:29.871 --> 09:33.618
...and to use THIS MUCH VOLUME
WHEN ADDRESSING OUR SUBJECTS!

09:37.289 --> 09:40.825
You know, that might explain why
your appearance was met with...

09:41.193 --> 09:42.694
...mixed results.

09:42.695 --> 09:45.093
I think if you just changed
your approach a bit...

09:45.094 --> 09:47.789
...you might be met
with a warmer reception.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.201
CHANGE OUR APPROACH?

09:50.814 --> 09:52.424
Or the volume.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.940
Oh. We have been locked away
for a thousand years.

09:55.941 --> 09:58.847
We are... not sure we can.

10:00.574 --> 10:04.666
Don't worry, princess. Fluttershy
can give you some great pointers.

10:04.667 --> 10:08.093
She's delicate and demure
with the sweetest little voice.

10:09.030 --> 10:12.187
GO AWAY! NO CANDY HERE! VISITORS
NOT WELCOME ON NIGHTMARE NIGHT!

10:13.846 --> 10:16.368
Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!

10:16.880 --> 10:18.177
It is you.

10:18.915 --> 10:20.316
Ah, and Nightmare Moon.

10:20.947 --> 10:22.081
Nightmare Moon?!

10:25.026 --> 10:26.013
Wait right here.

10:31.168 --> 10:35.212
Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?

10:35.810 --> 10:36.919
CHARMED!

10:40.251 --> 10:41.525
Likewise...

10:41.526 --> 10:44.902
TWILIGHT SPARKLE HATH SPOKEN
OF THE SWEETNESS OF THY VOICE.

10:44.903 --> 10:48.927
WE ASK, THOU TEACHEST TO US
TO SPEAK AS THOU SPEAKEST!

10:48.928 --> 10:49.832
Okay...

10:49.833 --> 10:51.441
SHALL OUR LESSONS BEGIN?

10:51.442 --> 10:52.561
Okay...

10:52.562 --> 10:54.431
SHALL WE MIMIC THY VOICE?

10:54.432 --> 10:55.206
Okay...

10:55.207 --> 10:56.699
HOW IS THIS?

10:56.700 --> 10:57.868
Perfect. Lesson over.

10:59.679 --> 11:01.576
A little quieter, princess.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.237
HOW IS... this?

11:04.238 --> 11:06.098
Better. Right, Fluttershy?

11:07.612 --> 11:08.583
Yes.

11:09.570 --> 11:12.730
How... about... now?

11:12.731 --> 11:14.044
Now you're getting it.

11:14.270 --> 11:16.531
And... how about now?

11:16.532 --> 11:18.290
Yes! Well done.

11:19.569 --> 11:21.925
AH, THANK YOU, DEAR FLUTTERSHY!

11:21.926 --> 11:23.899
OUR NORMAL SPEAKING
VOICE SHALL SURELY...

11:23.900 --> 11:26.812
...WIN US THE HEARTS
OF THY FELLOW VILLAGERS.

11:26.930 --> 11:28.382
Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us!

11:28.383 --> 11:29.743
Nightmare Moon is here and...

11:30.819 --> 11:35.195
She stole Fluttershy's voice so she
can't scream when she GOBBLES HER UP!!!

11:37.560 --> 11:39.440
NAY, CHILDREN, WAIT!

11:40.692 --> 11:43.959
I mean... nay, children, wait.

11:45.011 --> 11:47.854
Come on, princess. Time for plan B.

11:59.573 --> 12:01.713
It is of no use, Twilight Sparkle.

12:01.714 --> 12:04.279
They have never liked us
and they never shall.

12:04.280 --> 12:07.501
My friend Applejack is one of the
most likeable ponies around.

12:07.502 --> 12:09.416
I'm sure she'll have some ideas.

12:10.068 --> 12:10.929
Heee...!

12:10.930 --> 12:12.959
Whoop. Careful there, partner.

12:17.989 --> 12:19.778
Uh... Applejack.

12:19.779 --> 12:23.561
The princess is looking for a little
advice on how to fit in around here.

12:23.562 --> 12:25.538
"Fit in"? Really?

12:26.763 --> 12:28.852
I mean... that's easy!

12:28.853 --> 12:31.139
All you gotta do is have
the right attitude.

12:31.140 --> 12:35.119
Loosen up a bit, be positive,
play a few games, have some fun.

12:35.120 --> 12:35.821
Fun?

12:36.095 --> 12:38.497
What is this "fun" thou speakest of?

12:40.330 --> 12:43.550
Pray tell, what purpose do these serve?

12:43.551 --> 12:47.328
Try to land the
sp-sp-spiders on the web.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.200
You can do it, princess!

12:59.467 --> 13:02.642
Ha! Your princess enjoys this... fun.

13:02.692 --> 13:05.309
In what other ways
may we experience it?

13:07.747 --> 13:09.470
Fire away, princess!

13:13.912 --> 13:16.626
Ha ha! The fun has been doubled!

13:18.551 --> 13:20.283
Why don't you try bobbin' for apples?

13:20.284 --> 13:22.908
We got the best apples
in Equestria here, princess.

13:22.909 --> 13:25.764
I ask that thou call us... me...

13:26.259 --> 13:28.304
...Luna, fair Applejack.

13:28.305 --> 13:32.706
Hear me, villagers!
All of you! Call me Luna!

13:34.673 --> 13:36.855
Show me to this bobbing apples.

13:37.828 --> 13:39.065
Whoooa...!

13:40.990 --> 13:42.732
Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip?

13:42.733 --> 13:44.405
We lost him the last time
we had to run...

13:45.863 --> 13:47.670
NIGHTMARE MOON IS
GOBBLING PIPSQUEAK!

13:47.671 --> 13:50.294
EVERYPONY RUUUN!!!

13:52.117 --> 13:55.516
Heeelp! My backside has been gobbled!

13:55.517 --> 13:57.030
'Tis a lie!

13:57.031 --> 14:01.495
Thy backside is whole and ungobbled,
thou ungrateful whelp!

14:04.977 --> 14:08.324
Fair villagers, please do not back away.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.343
Let us join together in...

14:10.699 --> 14:12.000
...fun!

14:17.223 --> 14:20.978
Not enough fun for you?
What say you to this?

14:34.016 --> 14:37.453
Huzzah! How many points do I receive?

14:41.598 --> 14:43.052
Do not run away!

14:45.424 --> 14:47.926
As your princess we command you!

14:56.726 --> 14:59.743
BE STILL!!!

15:04.957 --> 15:07.651
Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!

15:07.652 --> 15:09.869
NO, TWILIGHT SPARKLE!

15:09.870 --> 15:13.049
WE MUST USE THE TRADITIONAL
ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE...

15:13.050 --> 15:15.079
...FOR WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO SAY.

15:16.491 --> 15:19.787
SINCE YOU CHOOSE TO FEAR YOUR PRINCESS
RATHER THAN LOVE HER...

15:19.788 --> 15:23.042
...AND DISHONOR HER WITH THIS
INSULTING CELEBRATION...

15:23.342 --> 15:27.617
...WE DECREE THAT NIGHTMARE
NIGHT SHALL BE CANCELED!

15:27.618 --> 15:30.174
FOREVER!

15:38.077 --> 15:40.796
Shoot. We had everything goin' our way.

15:40.797 --> 15:45.079
Luna was happy, everypony in town
was happy. Now look at 'em.

15:45.986 --> 15:49.455
But I wanted to be a zombie next year!

15:53.030 --> 15:54.656
It's not over yet.

15:54.657 --> 15:56.077
What are you gonna do?

15:56.078 --> 15:58.559
I'm going to do what I do best.

15:58.632 --> 16:00.134
Lecture her!

16:09.420 --> 16:10.466
Princess.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.588
Leave me be, Twilight Sparkle.

16:12.589 --> 16:16.458
Princess. I'm sorry it hasn't
worked out how we wanted.

16:16.459 --> 16:19.673
But you have to believe me when
I tell you that Nightmare Night...

16:19.674 --> 16:22.829
...is one of the most popular
celebrations we have.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.579
Yes. I can tell.

16:24.580 --> 16:28.792
By all the adoring shrieks
of the children as they run away.

16:29.775 --> 16:31.409
Princess.

16:51.626 --> 16:55.241
No! No shrieking. No squealing
or screaming either. Okay?

16:55.242 --> 16:56.345
Okay.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.703
There's something I want you to see.

16:58.704 --> 17:02.336
And I promise that it's safe, but you
really, really, really can't shriek.

17:02.337 --> 17:04.048
Do you promise not to shriek?

17:12.960 --> 17:16.069
Pinkie Pie, you remember
Princess Luna, right?

17:16.070 --> 17:19.593
Ah. The ringleader of the
frightened children.

17:20.037 --> 17:22.512
Hast thou come to make peace?

17:31.815 --> 17:33.147
Nightmare Moon!

17:34.290 --> 17:35.749
Rainbow!

17:41.068 --> 17:45.017
She's changed, Pinkie!
She's not evil or scary anymore!

17:45.018 --> 17:47.644
And she definitely doesn't
want to gobble you up!

17:49.018 --> 17:50.592
Well, duh.

17:50.593 --> 17:51.395
Huh?

17:51.396 --> 17:53.045
I know that. Sheesh, Twilight.

17:53.046 --> 17:56.019
I'm almost as big as her.
How's she gonna gobble me up?

17:56.020 --> 17:58.503
So why do you keep
running away and screaming?

17:58.504 --> 18:01.702
Sometimes it's just
really fun to be scared.

18:01.703 --> 18:03.778
Fun?

18:05.032 --> 18:07.404
Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!

18:07.405 --> 18:08.857
No, I'm not. I'm a chicken.

18:09.959 --> 18:12.106
Princess Luna!
I've finally figured out...

18:12.107 --> 18:14.611
...why you're having
so much trouble being liked!

18:14.612 --> 18:17.745
Forgive me if I withhold my enthusiasm.

18:17.746 --> 18:20.941
Come with me. I'll explain
everything on the way.

18:23.043 --> 18:26.593
Gosh. I never thought my
very first Nightmare Night...

18:26.594 --> 18:28.327
...would be my very last.

18:29.152 --> 18:34.816
Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret.
Nightmare Night's not over yet.

18:34.817 --> 18:40.369
We still have candy left to give,
So Nightmare Moon might let us live.

18:40.370 --> 18:43.308
Yes. Come on, little ponies.

18:43.309 --> 18:46.399
What's Nightmare Night without
the annual candy offering?

18:47.078 --> 18:50.237
You don't want Nightmare Moon
to gobble you up...

18:50.238 --> 18:52.198
...dooo youuu?

18:53.225 --> 18:56.007
Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me.

18:56.781 --> 18:59.196
Come on, kids!
Doesn't that sound like fun?

19:08.322 --> 19:10.098
Goodbye, Nightmare Night.

19:10.490 --> 19:11.887
Forever.

19:13.998 --> 19:15.771
CITIZENS OF PONYVILLE!

19:15.947 --> 19:19.007
YOU WERE WISE TO BRING THIS CANDY TO ME.

19:19.008 --> 19:21.275
I AM PLEASED WITH YOUR OFFERING.

19:21.276 --> 19:23.943
SO PLEASED THAT I MAY JUST EAT IT...

19:23.944 --> 19:26.929
...INSTEAD OF EATING YOU!

19:34.363 --> 19:38.837
I am not certain that did what
you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle.

19:38.838 --> 19:40.284
Just wait.

19:40.670 --> 19:43.641
For what? For... for them
to scream some more?

19:43.666 --> 19:45.844
Um... Princess Luna.

19:45.845 --> 19:49.060
I know there's not gonna be
any more Nightmare Night...

19:49.267 --> 19:52.639
...but do you suppose maybe
you could come back next year...

19:52.640 --> 19:54.691
...and scare us again anyway?

19:55.817 --> 19:58.767
Child. Are thou saying that thou...

19:59.034 --> 20:01.134
...likest me to scare you?

20:01.135 --> 20:04.406
It's really fun! Scary, but fun.

20:04.407 --> 20:05.784
It... is?

20:06.073 --> 20:09.357
Yeah! Nightmare Night is my
favorite night of the year.

20:09.358 --> 20:12.429
Well then. We shall have to bring...

20:12.430 --> 20:15.206
...NIGHTMARE NIGHT BACK!

20:15.207 --> 20:16.447
Whoa!

20:16.538 --> 20:19.542
You're my favorite princess ever!

20:20.699 --> 20:22.674
She said yes, guys!

20:22.675 --> 20:23.900
YAY!

20:23.901 --> 20:26.956
See? They really do like you, princess.

20:26.957 --> 20:29.057
Can it be true?

20:30.109 --> 20:32.700
OH, MOST WONDERFUL OF...

20:32.803 --> 20:35.021
I mean...

20:35.070 --> 20:38.032
Oh, most wonderful of nights.

20:38.562 --> 20:40.417
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:40.418 --> 20:44.218
"When you first sent me to Ponyville,
I didn't know anything about friendship."

20:44.219 --> 20:47.295
"I met somepony tonight who
was having the same problem..."

20:47.296 --> 20:49.467
"...your sister, Princess Luna."

20:49.684 --> 20:52.439
"She taught me that one of the best
things you can do with friendship..."

20:52.440 --> 20:55.860
"...is to give it to others and
help them find it themselves."

20:55.861 --> 20:58.852
"And I'm happy to report that
all of Ponyville has learned..."

20:58.853 --> 21:03.040
"...that even if somepony seems
a little intimidating, even scary..."

21:03.041 --> 21:07.458
"...when you offer them your friendship,
you'll discover a whole new pony underneath."

21:08.063 --> 21:11.269
"And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded
costume didn't go over..."

21:11.469 --> 21:15.005
"...this still turned out to be
the best Nightmare Night ever."

21:32.971 --> 21:36.471
