00:05.525 --> 00:08.306
Who could that be?
It's still dark!

00:11.376 --> 00:14.360
C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider
season's about to start!

00:19.784 --> 00:23.448
Oh, where are we?
What's the rush?

00:23.449 --> 00:26.162
The rush? Don't you remember
what happened last year?

00:26.163 --> 00:27.263
Or the year before that?

00:27.264 --> 00:29.876
Or pretty much any cider season ever?!

00:29.877 --> 00:31.577
Um, well...

00:32.188 --> 00:33.544
Pinkie Pie!

00:33.545 --> 00:37.676
She always ends up ahead of us in line,
and then they always run out of cider!

00:37.677 --> 00:40.425
- I guess I...
- Well not this year!

00:40.426 --> 00:42.757
This year, I'm gonna get there before sunrise...

00:42.758 --> 00:46.663
...so I can drink all the cider I want,
and laugh when she doesn't get any!

00:46.664 --> 00:48.364
It's the perfect plan.

00:49.127 --> 00:51.970
I might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while...

00:51.971 --> 00:54.750
...drinking it drop by drop in front of her...

00:55.831 --> 01:00.095
Gee Rainbow Dash, it looks like a few
other ponies had the same idea.

01:02.734 --> 01:06.456
Oh, gosh Pinkie, I love your new style.

01:06.457 --> 01:08.959
Who are all these ponies?!

01:08.960 --> 01:10.460
Isn't this great?

01:10.461 --> 01:12.997
I couldn't sleep last night 'cause
I was so excited about cider season...

01:12.998 --> 01:15.400
...and I had this brilliant idea
to come gather and camp out...

01:15.401 --> 01:17.799
...so I told a few others about it and
they all thought it was a great idea too...

01:17.800 --> 01:21.830
...and now it's just a big old cider party! Woohoo!

01:23.052 --> 01:24.930
Oh gosh, that's a lot of ponies.

01:24.931 --> 01:26.856
Hope they don't run out before you get any.

02:13.154 --> 02:14.936
Isn't this exciting, Spike?

02:14.937 --> 02:16.975
Opening day of cider season!

02:16.976 --> 02:21.226
Yeah! That means it's only thirty
more days to sapphire season!

02:21.227 --> 02:27.409
Attention, everypony! Cider
season is now officially open!

03:29.128 --> 03:32.152
Sorry everypony!
That's it for today!

03:33.682 --> 03:35.761
Surprise, surprise...

03:35.762 --> 03:37.309
You ran out again!

03:37.310 --> 03:39.242
Yeah, you always run out!

03:39.243 --> 03:41.304
For the record, I don't mind...

03:41.305 --> 03:43.939
Why can't you make enough cider for all of us?

03:43.940 --> 03:45.540
Or at least for me!

03:50.667 --> 03:54.598
Hold on everypony, we've done
our best to improve supply this year.

03:54.599 --> 03:56.861
You always say that!

03:56.862 --> 03:58.657
And it's always true.

03:58.658 --> 04:02.734
But Apple family cider is made
with love and integrity...

04:02.735 --> 04:05.813
...and only the highest quality apples in Equestria.

04:05.814 --> 04:09.007
Sorry, but that recipe takes time.

04:12.503 --> 04:16.362
If y'all just be patient, we'll
have plenty more tomorrow.

04:16.663 --> 04:19.737
She's right, y'know!
You can't rush perfection!

04:19.738 --> 04:22.462
And this year's batch was perfection!

04:22.463 --> 04:24.063
Uh, Pinkie Pie...

04:24.064 --> 04:26.812
I'll never forget the cider I just drank!

04:26.813 --> 04:31.067
It was a moment in time that will never exist again...

04:43.391 --> 04:45.821
What in Equestria is that?

05:04.735 --> 05:08.605
Well, lookie what we got here, brother of mine,
it's the same in every town

05:09.056 --> 05:12.646
Ponies with thirsty throats, dry tongues,
and not a drop of cider to be found

05:12.947 --> 05:16.696
Maybe they're not aware that there's
really no need for this teary despair

05:16.997 --> 05:21.682
And the key that they need to solve the
sad cider shortage you and I will share

05:23.111 --> 05:25.238
Well you've got opportunity

05:25.239 --> 05:27.464
In this very community

05:36.125 --> 05:37.663

05:37.664 --> 05:41.418
Nonpareil, that's exactly the reason why, you see

05:41.419 --> 05:44.873
Nopony else in this whole place will give you
such a chance to be where you need to be

05:45.374 --> 05:48.117
And that's a new world, with tons of cider

05:48.118 --> 05:50.234
Fresh squeezed and ready for drinking

05:50.235 --> 05:54.136
More cider than you could drink
in all your days of thinking

05:54.137 --> 05:55.437
I doubt that.

05:55.638 --> 05:57.950

06:08.515 --> 06:12.595
I suppose by now you're wondering,
about our peculiar mode of transport

06:12.596 --> 06:16.456
I say, our mode of locomotion

06:16.457 --> 06:20.713
And I suppose by now you're wondering,
where is this promised cider?

06:20.714 --> 06:24.455
Any horse can make a claim
and any pony can do the same

06:24.456 --> 06:26.889
But my brother and I have something
most unique and superb

06:26.890 --> 06:28.832
Unseen at any time in this great new world

06:28.833 --> 06:32.921
And that's opportunity

Oh, we got opportunity

06:50.752 --> 06:52.978
In this very community

06:52.979 --> 06:55.304
Please Flim, please Flam, help us out of this jam

06:55.305 --> 06:58.722
With the Flim Flam brothers'
Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000

06:58.723 --> 07:02.329
Young filly, I would be ever so honored if
you might see fit to let my brother and I...

07:02.330 --> 07:04.628
...borrow some of your delicious, and might I add...

07:04.629 --> 07:07.971
...spell-bindingly fragrant apples for
our little demonstration here?

07:07.972 --> 07:09.172
Uh, sure, I guess.

07:09.173 --> 07:11.550
Opportunity, in our community

07:11.551 --> 07:12.651
- Ready Flim?
- Ready Flam.

07:12.652 --> 07:13.952
Let's bing-bang zam!

07:13.953 --> 07:17.827
And show these thirsty ponies
a world of delectable cider!

07:17.828 --> 07:21.676
Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider...

07:21.677 --> 07:23.578
Watch closely, my friends!

07:23.579 --> 07:26.599
The fun begins!

07:26.600 --> 07:28.174
Now, here's where the magic happens.

07:28.175 --> 07:31.612
Right here in this heaving roiling cider
press boiling guts of the very machine...

07:31.613 --> 07:33.772
...those apples plucked fresh are right now as we speak...

07:33.773 --> 07:38.375
...being turned into grade-A top-notch five-star
blow-your-horses-off one-of-a-kind cider!

07:38.376 --> 07:41.912
Feel free to take a sneak peek!

07:41.913 --> 07:44.079
Now wait, you fellas, hold it!

07:44.080 --> 07:46.060
You went and over-sold it!

07:46.061 --> 07:49.343
I guarantee that what you have there won't compare

07:49.644 --> 07:52.004
For the very most important ingredient

07:52.005 --> 07:54.209
Can't be added or done expedient

07:54.210 --> 07:57.602
And it's quality, friends, Apple Acre's quality and care!

07:57.603 --> 08:02.028
Well Granny, I'm glad you brought that up,
my dear, I say I'm glad you brought that up

08:02.029 --> 08:06.134
You see that we are very picky when
it comes to cider if you'll kindly try a cup

08:06.535 --> 08:10.494
Yes, sir, yes ma'am this great machine,
it's just the very best

08:10.495 --> 08:12.635
So whaddaya say then, Apples

08:12.636 --> 08:14.784
Care to step into the modern world

08:14.785 --> 08:20.088
And put the Super Speedy Cider
Squeezy 6000 to the test?

08:20.089 --> 08:23.020
What do you think, folks?
Do you see what the Apples can't?

08:23.021 --> 08:26.363
I see it clear as day!
I know she does! So does he!

08:26.364 --> 08:29.120
C'mon Ponyville, you know
what I'm talking about!

08:29.121 --> 08:31.041
We're saying you've got

08:31.042 --> 08:32.442
Opportunity

08:32.443 --> 08:34.745
In this very community

08:34.746 --> 08:35.962
He's Flim, he's Flam

08:35.963 --> 08:38.583
We're the world famous Flim Flam brothers

08:38.584 --> 08:45.626
Traveling salesponies nonpareil

08:46.247 --> 08:47.415
Yeah!

08:47.816 --> 08:49.703
You got a deal!

08:51.593 --> 08:53.947
Not so fast!

08:54.859 --> 08:59.746
No way no how that machine matches up
with the care we put in our cider!

08:59.747 --> 09:04.076
But if it really does work, we could
make everypony in town happy!

09:04.077 --> 09:08.275
I just don't know, y'all. We've
always made cider the same way.

09:08.376 --> 09:09.576
Eeyup.

09:10.836 --> 09:13.533
We'll sweeten the deal.
You supply the apples...

09:13.534 --> 09:17.568
We supply the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.

09:17.569 --> 09:19.834
Then we split those sweet sweet profits...

09:19.835 --> 09:21.809
Seventy five...
- Twenty five.

09:21.810 --> 09:22.510
Deal!

09:22.511 --> 09:24.835
Hold on, who gets the seventy five?

09:24.836 --> 09:26.620
Why us, naturally.

09:26.621 --> 09:30.833
And, we'll throw in the magic
to power the machine for free.

09:32.340 --> 09:35.131
Cider sales keep our business
afloat through the winter.

09:35.132 --> 09:37.796
We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.

09:37.797 --> 09:40.318
So? What'll it be?

09:40.519 --> 09:41.870
No deal.

09:42.371 --> 09:46.010
Very well, if you refuse our
generous offer to be partners...

09:46.011 --> 09:48.414
...then we'll just have to be competitors.

09:48.415 --> 09:50.157
You wouldn't dare.

09:50.158 --> 09:51.258
Oh no?

09:52.280 --> 09:57.882
Don't you worry, everypony!
There'll be plenty of cider for all of you!

09:57.883 --> 10:01.219
Once we drive Sweet Apple Acres out of business.

10:18.549 --> 10:20.693
Still worried about Flim and Flam?

10:20.694 --> 10:23.295
Granny Smith says they were just blowing hot air.

10:23.296 --> 10:24.654
I'm not so sure.

10:24.655 --> 10:27.974
They sounded mighty serious when they
threatened to run us out of business.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.246
That's it! Last cup!

10:30.247 --> 10:32.595
Oh for Pete's sake!

10:32.596 --> 10:35.059
C'mon back tomorrow, everypony!

10:35.060 --> 10:36.760
*Tomorrow?*

10:45.024 --> 10:47.493
What seems to be the problem here?

10:47.494 --> 10:50.611
Oh my oh my, out of cider again?

10:51.711 --> 10:54.923
What have we here?
Who'd like a cup?

10:59.362 --> 11:05.066
Don't worry, everypony, we've got the Super Speedy
Cider Squeezy 6000 to make more in an instant!

11:09.131 --> 11:10.990
You can't sell that cider!

11:12.216 --> 11:14.452
That's made from Apple family apples!

11:14.453 --> 11:17.231
Is this some kind of cruel joke?

11:17.232 --> 11:21.024
Don't worry, everypony, there are
plenty of apples in Equestria.

11:21.025 --> 11:25.220
We'll find some others and make more
cider than all of Ponyville can drink!

11:25.821 --> 11:29.304
We'll make more cider than you could ever imagine!

11:32.074 --> 11:36.476
Now, it ain't about the speed,
young'un, it's about quality.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.987
Who cares how good the cider is,
if I never get to drink any?

11:40.988 --> 11:44.947
Oh, look at these poor, dissatisfied ponies.

11:44.948 --> 11:47.950
Ponyville is Sweet Apple Cider country!

11:48.451 --> 11:50.929
Our cider speaks for itself!

11:50.930 --> 11:52.929
Let's put it to the test!

11:52.930 --> 11:55.411
Anywhere, anytime!

11:56.498 --> 11:58.483
Well, that's enough, now.

11:58.484 --> 12:04.108
With our machine, we can make enough cider
in one hour to satisfy this entire town!

12:04.109 --> 12:06.421
We'll do it in 45 minutes!

12:08.710 --> 12:11.468
Easy, Apple Bloom, easy.

12:11.469 --> 12:14.884
What's the matter, Granny Smith? Chicken?

12:14.885 --> 12:17.388
What did you call me, sonny?

12:17.389 --> 12:21.268
If you're so confident in your cider,
then what's the problem?

12:21.269 --> 12:23.783
Tomorrow mornin', right here!

12:23.784 --> 12:27.940
But I'm afraid we haven't any... apples.

12:27.941 --> 12:30.353
You can use our south field...

12:30.354 --> 12:33.836
...and it'd be worth it to teach you
all a thing or two about cider making!

12:33.837 --> 12:35.743
Excellent, we have a bet.

12:35.744 --> 12:41.447
Whoever produces the most barrels in one hour,
wins the exclusive right to sell cider in Ponyville.

12:43.986 --> 12:50.385
And after we beat ya, I don't never want to
see you bimbahoozalers around here again!

12:51.363 --> 12:53.644
Until... tomorrow.

12:56.453 --> 12:59.869
Don't worry, Applejack,
I know you'll win tomorrow!

12:59.870 --> 13:03.978
We'd better, 'cause if we don't,
we're gonna lose our farm!

13:17.503 --> 13:20.660
Applejack? Are you sure
this is such a good idea?

13:20.661 --> 13:24.446
Me and the family are...
a hundred percent confident...

13:24.447 --> 13:26.932
...in our cider making capabilities.

13:26.933 --> 13:30.750
And besides, nopony calls Granny a chicken.

13:31.663 --> 13:34.145
Attention everypony!

13:34.146 --> 13:35.560
Well, good luck.

13:36.561 --> 13:38.104
Thanks Twilight.

13:39.213 --> 13:40.515
We'll need it.

13:40.586 --> 13:44.716
The teams have one hour to produce
as much cider as they can.

13:44.717 --> 13:47.119
After which, the barrels will be counted...

13:47.120 --> 13:53.267
...and the winner will be named the
sole cider provider for all of Ponyville!

13:55.072 --> 13:56.934
Are both teams ready?

14:01.379 --> 14:02.286
Ready!

14:03.279 --> 14:04.740
Ready!

14:04.741 --> 14:06.272
Then let's...

14:07.875 --> 14:09.303
...go!

14:23.044 --> 14:26.753
Bad 'un. Good 'un!
Bad 'un...

14:34.341 --> 14:37.843
Great job, y'all!
We've already filled an entire barrel!

14:37.844 --> 14:40.505
I'll bet you those guys don't even have...

15:04.700 --> 15:06.825
C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus!

15:06.826 --> 15:09.666
We gotta forget those guys if we're
gonna have a chance of winnin'!

15:09.667 --> 15:14.107
Sorry, sis! Better keep up, Granny,
we're fallin' behind!

15:16.916 --> 15:19.465
Good 'un... bad 'un...

15:19.466 --> 15:21.738
Rest when it's over, Big Macintosh!

15:21.739 --> 15:23.852
Ride! Ride!

15:27.887 --> 15:29.901
This is just dreadful.

15:29.902 --> 15:34.286
Even at top speed, the Apples are only
making one barrel to the twins' three!

15:39.838 --> 15:44.224
Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members
allowed to help in the competition?

15:44.225 --> 15:46.821
Well, I'm not sure...

15:46.822 --> 15:51.531
Flim, Flam, would you object to
honorary family members helping?

15:51.832 --> 15:53.637
Are you kidding?

15:53.638 --> 15:57.035
We don't care if the whole
kingdom of Canterlot helps.

15:57.036 --> 15:59.117
It's a lost cause.

15:59.418 --> 16:03.837
I guess it's okay.
Applejack? What do you think?

16:04.238 --> 16:08.163
I think I'd love to have the
rest of my family helpin' out.

16:08.264 --> 16:10.011
All right!

16:12.612 --> 16:16.804
Okay everypony, we're not gonna let those
smooth talkers take our friend's farm.

16:16.805 --> 16:18.005
Yeah!

16:18.306 --> 16:21.337
Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees.

16:21.338 --> 16:22.338
Got it.

16:22.339 --> 16:25.064
Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail.

16:25.065 --> 16:26.869
Yes sir, ma'am, sir!

16:26.870 --> 16:29.126
Rarity, you've got a discerning eye.

16:29.127 --> 16:31.458
Help Granny Smith at the quality control station.

16:31.459 --> 16:32.459
Of course.

16:32.460 --> 16:35.460
Rainbow Dash, do you think you
can help Big Macintosh press?

16:35.461 --> 16:36.661
In my sleep!

16:36.662 --> 16:40.234
Alright everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres!

16:40.235 --> 16:41.635
All right!

16:46.885 --> 16:49.361
Over there, Apple Bloom!
Don't miss them!

16:50.069 --> 16:52.214
Right behind you, Pinkie Pie!

16:54.001 --> 16:56.342
Good 'un, bad 'un, bad 'un, good 'un...

16:56.343 --> 16:59.553
Lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely...

17:06.752 --> 17:11.235
Based on these figures, we're making
five barrels for every three of theirs!

17:12.111 --> 17:15.665
Keep it up, everypony!
We're back in this!

17:16.866 --> 17:19.738
Come on, brother, we've gotta pick up the pace!

17:19.739 --> 17:21.912
Right, double the power!

17:32.310 --> 17:34.306
We gotta try something else!

17:34.307 --> 17:37.216
I've got it, brother of mine.

17:40.770 --> 17:44.691
Well done, Flam!
We're at top productivity!

17:47.224 --> 17:49.906
C'mon, Rainbow Dash, keep grinding!

17:49.907 --> 17:53.411
We don't have time for quality control,
if we wanna win this thing!

17:54.924 --> 17:59.310
Get back, you!
One bad apple spoils the bunch!

17:59.311 --> 18:00.961
Applejack, help me!

18:00.962 --> 18:03.726
There's no point in winnin' if we cheat!

18:03.727 --> 18:05.550
We'll just have to work harder!

18:05.551 --> 18:06.991
C'mon, everypony!

18:07.292 --> 18:10.105
All right then, double time!

18:35.942 --> 18:37.668
Time's up!

18:43.540 --> 18:45.354
I'm proud of you, Applejack.

18:45.355 --> 18:46.655
Thanks.

18:47.156 --> 18:51.461
Integrity like that, will always be... rewarded.

18:51.462 --> 18:54.302
Flim and Flam win!

18:57.321 --> 19:00.145
We... lost?

19:00.846 --> 19:02.976
Too bad, Apples.

19:02.977 --> 19:08.567
Guess you'll just have to find a new line of work
that doesn't match your names quite so... perfectly.

19:08.568 --> 19:12.521
Now should we tear down all these tacky
old buildings and put up new ones, brother?

19:12.522 --> 19:14.711
I don't see why not, brother.

19:14.712 --> 19:18.408
After all, this isn't Sweet Apple Acres anymore.

19:18.609 --> 19:22.569
How about 'Flim Flam Fields'?

19:22.910 --> 19:25.417
I ought to press you into jerk cider!

19:25.818 --> 19:29.043
No, Rainbow Dash.
A deal's a deal.

19:31.861 --> 19:34.065
Congratulations to y'all.

19:34.066 --> 19:38.509
The cider business in Ponyville... is yours.

19:38.510 --> 19:42.224
C'mon, Apples. Let's go pack up our things.

19:43.686 --> 19:48.289
Fear not, everypony. There's more
than enough cider to go around.

19:51.847 --> 19:53.663
Go ahead, everypony.

19:54.315 --> 19:57.581
Go on, y'all. It's okay.

20:00.189 --> 20:05.219
Drink up, Ponyville!
Down the hatch!

20:09.686 --> 20:11.985
I can't get the taste off my tongue!

20:11.986 --> 20:13.787
Mine's got rocks in it.

20:13.788 --> 20:16.847
I wouldn't pay one cent for this dreck!

20:16.848 --> 20:19.938
You wouldn't pay even one cent?

20:19.939 --> 20:20.939
No!

20:23.017 --> 20:25.453
How about two cups for one cent?

20:25.454 --> 20:26.454
No!

20:27.883 --> 20:29.785
Two bits for a barrel?

20:29.786 --> 20:30.986
No!

20:32.730 --> 20:34.906
It looks like we've encountered a slight...

20:34.907 --> 20:37.201
...problem here, in Ponyville.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.013
Nopony wants our product. Next town?

20:40.014 --> 20:41.114
Next town.

20:41.494 --> 20:44.035
- Let's go, Flim!
- Let's go, Flam!

20:48.937 --> 20:50.498
They're gone.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.670
That means Sweet Apple Acres is still in business!

20:53.671 --> 20:57.141
Plus we can have high quality Apple family cider!

20:57.142 --> 20:59.165
Because of this silly competition...

20:59.166 --> 21:02.071
...we've made enough of our
cider for the whole town!

21:05.933 --> 21:08.205
"Dear Princess Celestia..."

21:08.206 --> 21:10.758
"...I wanted to share my thoughts with you. "

21:12.234 --> 21:15.771
"I didn't learn anythin'!
I was right all along!"

21:15.772 --> 21:20.482
"If you take your time to do things the
right way, your work will speak for itself."

21:20.783 --> 21:24.799
"Sure, I could tell you I learned something about
how my friends are always there to help me..."

21:24.800 --> 21:26.711
"...and I can count on them no matter what..."

21:26.712 --> 21:30.349
"...but truth is, I knew that already too."
