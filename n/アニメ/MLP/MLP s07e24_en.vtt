WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:06.405
Oooh!

00:06.607 --> 00:08.507
Excuse me, when
does the noon train

00:08.609 --> 00:10.242
from the Crystal
Empire arrive?

00:10.744 --> 00:12.578
Uh, noon?

00:12.680 --> 00:16.248
Hm. Right. Sorry, I'm
just a little excited

00:16.350 --> 00:18.083
because my friend
Sunburst is coming.

00:18.485 --> 00:20.085
He's my oldest friend.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.721
I mean, we've known each
other practically forever.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.424
We have tons in common.

00:25.226 --> 00:28.494
We both love magic and games
and jokes. Everything, really.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.697
Now that I think about it, there
isn't a pony in all of Equestria

00:31.799 --> 00:33.232
I have more in
common with.

00:56.156 --> 00:57.089
Sunburst: Starlight?

00:58.991 --> 01:00.059
Sunburst!

01:00.461 --> 01:01.226
You made it!

01:01.628 --> 01:02.461
Of course!

01:02.563 --> 01:04.963
I've been looking forward to
this visit for a long time.

01:07.285 --> 01:07.985
Huh..

01:09.235 --> 01:09.835
Whoa!

01:09.937 --> 01:11.403
How long are you staying?

01:11.805 --> 01:14.706
Er.. just a... little
reading for the train.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.609
Same old Sunburst.

01:19.322 --> 01:20.022
Huh.

01:20.547 --> 01:23.148
It's going to be so great
spending time together.

01:23.450 --> 01:24.851
Just like old times.

01:25.553 --> 01:29.020
You and me doing the stuff
we like: games, magic...

01:29.122 --> 01:30.055
Antiquing.

01:30.557 --> 01:31.156
What?

01:31.458 --> 01:32.257
Antiquing.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.625
You know I like antiquing.

01:33.827 --> 01:34.493
You do?

01:34.795 --> 01:36.662
Um, of course!

01:36.764 --> 01:39.498
Historical knickknacks,
ancient relics.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.667
Oh! You are SO lucky!

01:41.769 --> 01:43.936
Ponyville is antique central!

01:44.438 --> 01:45.537
It is..?

01:45.639 --> 01:47.473
How have we never
talked about this?

01:47.675 --> 01:50.709
We are going antiquing
and you are gonna love it!

01:50.911 --> 01:54.380
OK. Let's drop your stuff
off at the castle first.

01:54.782 --> 02:00.219
Sure! Only.. heh.. we may need
to make a few trips.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.227
This is so great!

02:42.329 --> 02:43.929
Who knew I'd be
the one showing

02:44.031 --> 02:45.664
you the cool sights
of Ponyville?

02:46.066 --> 02:48.700
I'm a little surprised, myself.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.408
Wow, what a difference between
the hoof-molded bricks

02:56.510 --> 02:58.244
and the extruded ones, right?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.178
Uh huh. Ha ha.

03:01.948 --> 03:04.850
Oooh! Check out all
these chandeliers!

03:05.252 --> 03:08.254
Sometimes the crystals
have magical properties.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.955
Oh. That's cool.
How do you--

03:11.024 --> 03:11.923
Twilight: Sunburst!

03:12.792 --> 03:14.226
I'm so glad
you're here!

03:15.261 --> 03:16.528
In the antique store?

03:16.730 --> 03:17.728
In Ponyville!

03:18.030 --> 03:20.565
Starlight's really been
looking forward to your visit.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.802
Though I'm glad you're
in the antique store too!

03:24.004 --> 03:25.537
I'm usually the only one...

03:26.239 --> 03:27.339
That's crazy!

03:27.441 --> 03:28.740
Who doesn't
like antiquing?

03:28.842 --> 03:29.641
Right?

03:29.843 --> 03:31.477
Heh heh... right!

03:32.379 --> 03:33.479
Oooh, look!

03:33.581 --> 03:36.616
An ancient map of Equestria
made by the Mighty Helm!

03:37.918 --> 03:40.852
Without the help of unicorn
magic or pegasus flight,

03:40.954 --> 03:42.821
the earth ponies
of the Mighty Helm

03:42.923 --> 03:45.724
were able to map the
entire coast of Equestria!

03:46.126 --> 03:47.626
Coooool..

04:20.159 --> 04:22.894
You don't have to pretend
to like all this stuff.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.432
What? No. I
do like it. Heh.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.901
I mean, if you
like it, I like it.

04:29.203 --> 04:32.237
Besides, we've almost
looked at everything.. right?

04:32.339 --> 04:33.405
Twilight: Oh, wow!

04:33.507 --> 04:35.841
You have got to see this
Saddle Arabian vanity!

04:37.910 --> 04:40.379
This shop looked a lot
smaller from the outside.

05:03.269 --> 05:05.804
Did you see this
Palominian letter opener?

05:05.906 --> 05:09.441
Wow! That goes well with this
ancient Phoenix feather quill.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.109
We could write
to each other!

05:11.311 --> 05:12.711
PEN PALS!

05:16.950 --> 05:20.452
Um.. I really like this
old-timey barrel.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.889
Actually, the stuff I
bought is inside the barrel,

05:24.091 --> 05:25.925
but I can't wait
to see what it is!

05:26.627 --> 05:29.061
Wait, you don't know
what you bought?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.897
Mm-mm! It's a blind buy.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.833
Sometimes shops get too busy
to go through everything

05:34.935 --> 05:37.602
so they load up a box
or barrel and sell it

05:37.704 --> 05:39.404
without knowing
what's inside!

05:39.606 --> 05:41.773
Buying one is sort of
like a treasure hunt.

05:43.042 --> 05:46.011
Once I found a first edition
History of Equestria

05:46.213 --> 05:48.480
in the original Olde Ponish.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.916
"<i> Hliet foresettan pliht."</i>

05:54.888 --> 05:56.721
It's an Olde Ponish saying.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.891
"Reward prefers risk."

05:59.993 --> 06:02.861
Uh. It... loses something
in the translation.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.432
Mmm. [giggle]

06:07.334 --> 06:09.468
Hm. Why don't we look
through this stuff later?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.870
Yeah. What do you want
to do, Starlight?

06:12.072 --> 06:16.407
Well, I don't know if you're
going to remember this, but...

06:17.310 --> 06:19.110
[gasp] Is this...

06:21.414 --> 06:22.848
DRAGON PIT!

06:23.250 --> 06:24.349
I remember
that game.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.651
You two used
to play it?

06:26.153 --> 06:28.554
Heh. Pretty much any time we
weren't working on magic.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.056
I can't believe
you found a copy!

06:36.062 --> 06:39.130
Sunburst would get so excited
whenever his dragon got trapped

06:39.232 --> 06:40.733
he'd knock the whole board over!

06:41.335 --> 06:42.268
That's adorable.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.837
Eh.. well, it's an exciting game.

06:45.039 --> 06:47.772
But I have a little more
control over my horn now.

06:55.681 --> 06:56.582
Uh-oh!

06:56.684 --> 06:59.284
Somepony's dragon's
gonna get trapped!

07:03.255 --> 07:04.724
Doesn't seem so
exciting to m--

07:05.326 --> 07:07.859
AAAHAHHAHAHH!

07:10.632 --> 07:12.264
Huh. I guess it is adorable.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.404
I hope you're enjoying
your visit so far.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.672
Are you kidding!?

07:20.774 --> 07:24.376
I mean, first antiquing and then
spending time with Twilight!

07:24.578 --> 07:26.278
Oh. Yeah.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.180
She's.. pretty great.

07:28.382 --> 07:30.615
Right? I mean, I know
she's a Princess,

07:30.717 --> 07:33.952
but I never thought she'd be so
fun to just hang out with.

07:34.354 --> 07:37.356
Well, she is the
Princess of Friendship.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.757
[chuckle] Right.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.025
I guess that makes sense.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.227
So. Tomorrow
I thought--

07:42.329 --> 07:45.164
I suppose I'm just surprised
at how well we get along.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.100
I don't have much in
common with most ponies.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.836
You two are pretty similar.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.505
I don't know many ponies who
are fluent in Olde Ponish.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.407
Exactly!

07:56.209 --> 07:58.109
I probably have more in
common with Twilight

07:58.211 --> 08:00.079
than any pony in Equestria!

08:00.681 --> 08:01.647
Right.

08:02.949 --> 08:04.917
Anyway, I better
get some sleep.

08:05.419 --> 08:08.921
[yawn] Ponyville might be small,
but there's a lot to do.

08:09.423 --> 08:12.390
Maybe we should ask Twilight
what she recommends we see!

08:12.492 --> 08:13.992
Um, sure.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.094
Great! Goodnight, Starlight.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.196
Um, goodnight.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.540
[door opens]
Knock, knock!

08:28.942 --> 08:29.741
Wh-what!?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.777
Oh. Hi, Starlight.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.478
Is it morning already?

08:34.881 --> 08:35.580
Yep!

08:35.682 --> 08:37.949
Maybe a bit early,
but like you said,

08:38.051 --> 08:39.885
there's a lot to
see in Ponyville!

08:40.087 --> 08:42.588
Uh, right. OK.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.224
Heh. Plus, I couldn't really sleep.

08:45.326 --> 08:48.260
I just kept thinking about all
the stuff we have in common

08:48.362 --> 08:50.195
and how much fun
we'll have today.

08:50.597 --> 08:53.031
Great. Is Twilight up yet?

08:53.133 --> 08:56.835
A-Actually, I'm pretty sure she's
busy with Princess stuff today.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.536
Oh. [yawn]

09:00.072 --> 09:04.209
But I've got a full day of stuff
planned, just you and me.

09:05.011 --> 09:06.210
Uh. Great!

09:07.680 --> 09:10.682
Um. Would you mind turning
around, or preferably...

09:10.884 --> 09:12.884
leaving the room so
I could get changed?

09:13.086 --> 09:15.921
Oh! Right! Ha ha,
sorry, ah ha...

09:19.193 --> 09:22.527
One, genuine, Sweet
Apple Acres apple tree!

09:25.064 --> 09:28.734
Because we used to drink so
much apple juice as foals?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.470
Hmm.. I don't remember that.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.339
Really? I mean, it
was all we drank.

09:34.541 --> 09:35.440
Uh.. here.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.808
Try an apple. I bet that'll jog your memory.

09:40.713 --> 09:42.148
Oh! Ow..

09:43.250 --> 09:43.982
Trixie?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.384
What are you doing here?

09:46.286 --> 09:49.621
I often seek the privacy of
the orchard to practice

09:49.723 --> 09:51.423
new feats of amazement.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.559
And, also I fell asleep.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.663
Oh. Well, Sunburst and I
were just catching up, so...

09:57.765 --> 09:59.865
[gasp] I don't suppose the two
of you want to see

09:59.967 --> 10:02.434
a never-before-witnessed
magical marvel?

10:02.836 --> 10:03.735
Sure!

10:04.137 --> 10:05.970
[sigh] Why not.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.676
Behold, visiting friend
from Starlight's past

10:11.778 --> 10:14.913
and be amazed by the
Great and Powerful

10:15.015 --> 10:18.817
and current best friend
of Starlight, TRIXIE!

10:28.595 --> 10:30.129
I give you...

10:31.231 --> 10:33.766
THE UNICORN ESCAPE!

10:34.868 --> 10:36.301
[grunts]

10:36.403 --> 10:38.870
One more...twist...

10:38.972 --> 10:41.840
and... [grunts]

10:41.942 --> 10:43.308
The great and
powerful Trixie

10:43.410 --> 10:45.243
requires a little
assistance.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.147
I know this trick.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.082
There's a special link,
but I could never

10:51.184 --> 10:52.984
hold the chain up long
enough to find it.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.667
Well, if I could
do magic like that,

11:08.769 --> 11:11.603
I'd have a whole slew of new
tricks at my disposal.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.140
I always liked close up magic
because I knew I could do it

11:15.242 --> 11:16.641
if I just practiced enough.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.156
Starlight, why
didn't you tell me

12:05.258 --> 12:07.759
how much Sunburst
and I had in common?

12:08.361 --> 12:10.195
Gee. I don't know.

12:12.098 --> 12:15.567
I know Trixie's "magic"
is, you know, fun...

12:15.669 --> 12:18.503
but the Mirror Pool
is actual magic.

12:18.805 --> 12:22.541
Whoa! This place
is pure ponylore.

12:22.943 --> 12:26.478
Yep. I mean, it's supposed
to be all dangerous.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.214
I guess I shouldn't have
broken the seal to get in,

12:29.316 --> 12:31.984
but you wanted to see the
sights of Ponyville, right?

12:32.486 --> 12:35.720
So, Pinkie Pie just dove in
and made copies of herself?

12:36.022 --> 12:37.355
Mm-hm!

12:37.457 --> 12:39.925
If we made copies of ourselves,

12:40.027 --> 12:43.594
we could get a year's worth of
hanging out over in one day.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.598
Eh.. not that we would.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.000
Do you hear that?

12:51.003 --> 12:53.438
Ooh. I hope it's not a
left over Pinkie Pie.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.873
Maud: Not exactly.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.209
Maud? How did
you get in here?

12:57.511 --> 12:59.712
This cavern's actually
connected to mine.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.080
Ah.. what are you doing?

13:02.182 --> 13:03.014
Tapping.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.816
Maud isn't
super chatty.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.419
I mean, you and I could sit
around and talk all day,

13:07.621 --> 13:09.454
but she looks pretty busy.

13:12.491 --> 13:14.759
Are you taking some
kind of core sample?

13:14.861 --> 13:15.794
Not exactly.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.830
I'm uncovering this section
of strata for closer study.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.032
You might want to step back.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.340
I'm studying this
area's metamorphic--

13:28.442 --> 13:29.541
--foliation!

13:29.643 --> 13:32.244
Is this gneiss,
phyllite, or slate?

13:32.546 --> 13:34.980
Wow. The pressure above
must be pretty uniform

13:35.082 --> 13:37.616
to get the planar fabric
to be this consistent.

13:37.718 --> 13:39.284
You know about geology?

13:39.586 --> 13:40.685
I dabble.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.954
For example, by the
speleothems in this cave,

13:43.056 --> 13:45.257
I kinda figured there
was another way out.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.726
Because of the
calcite deposits.

14:11.383 --> 14:12.250
Starlight?

14:12.452 --> 14:13.419
Where's Sunburst?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.822
Doing stage magic with Trixie?

14:17.224 --> 14:18.990
Studying new rocks with Maud?

14:19.192 --> 14:22.493
You're here so I guess you
two aren't off translating

14:22.595 --> 14:24.496
some ancient Olde Ponish text.

14:24.798 --> 14:25.831
What are you talking about?

14:26.133 --> 14:28.033
Why would Sunburst
be doing any of that?

14:28.235 --> 14:30.402
I thought he came to
Ponyville to see you.

14:31.004 --> 14:34.840
I thought so too, but it
hasn't worked out that way.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.909
When we were foals,
we had more in common

14:38.011 --> 14:40.212
than any two ponies
in Equestria.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.914
But now it seems like
he's got more in common

14:43.016 --> 14:45.083
with my friends than
he does with me.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.388
Oh. Everypony changes,
but that doesn't mean

14:50.490 --> 14:52.123
there aren't still
things you both like.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.259
You both love magic, right?

14:54.661 --> 14:55.360
Magic?

14:55.662 --> 14:57.796
Sure. You're
really good at it

14:57.898 --> 15:00.866
and Sunburst practically knows
every spell that ever was.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.867
[gasp] You're right!

15:02.969 --> 15:04.002
Thanks, Twilight!

15:04.104 --> 15:05.003
You're the best!

15:05.405 --> 15:06.872
Eh. I try.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.574
Starlight, what happened?

15:09.876 --> 15:12.510
Maud and I found some
fascinating sedimentary stratum,

15:12.612 --> 15:15.113
but when I turned to
show you, you were gone.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.049
Maud does have a way of making
rocks really interesting,

15:18.151 --> 15:21.886
but I wanted to work on
something a little more "us."

15:24.957 --> 15:25.690
What's this?

15:25.992 --> 15:28.192
Just a little
something I made up.

15:30.296 --> 15:33.465
Whoa! You made up this
spell? Just now?

15:34.067 --> 15:34.833
Yep!

15:48.315 --> 15:49.314
Wow.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.015
I know, right?

15:51.217 --> 15:53.651
But wait, there's more.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.795
Cool, right?

16:04.197 --> 16:05.597
Um, sure.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.498
Now we can play Dragon Pit!

16:07.600 --> 16:08.866
Just like we used to.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.238
Actually, I thought we
could go with Maud and--

16:13.340 --> 16:15.907
I mean, nothing was better
than just you and me

16:16.009 --> 16:18.209
playing this game when
we were foals, right?

16:18.411 --> 16:19.244
Starlight..

16:19.346 --> 16:21.179
Do you what to be red or blue?

16:22.648 --> 16:23.581
Starlight!

16:23.683 --> 16:25.450
I don't want to play
the game at all!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.396
What's going on in here?

16:37.898 --> 16:41.199
Nothing. I was trying to have
fun doing the ONE thing

16:41.301 --> 16:42.934
I thought we still
had in common,

16:43.436 --> 16:45.637
but I guess we don't even
have that anymore.

16:54.614 --> 16:55.912
I don't understand...

16:56.214 --> 16:58.583
Starlight and I have known each
other since we were foals,

16:58.685 --> 17:01.987
but that doesn't mean we
have to be foals to hang out.

17:02.089 --> 17:05.724
Hm. Starlight does have a
tendency to over-do.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.060
I mean, it is surprising how
well I get along with

17:09.162 --> 17:12.697
all of her friends, but she and
I still have tons in common.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.700
Maybe you just need to remind
her what those things are.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.235
That's it!

17:17.337 --> 17:19.104
That's exactly what I'll do.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.106
Right after I think of them.

17:22.908 --> 17:23.808
Oh.

17:25.544 --> 17:31.015
Obviously you and I hit it
off. I am quite impressive.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.684
And we share a love
for prestidigitation!

17:35.387 --> 17:36.187
Right.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.623
And Starlight and I share
a lot of things too.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.525
I just need to
think of them.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.527
What else do you
guys have in common?

17:43.029 --> 17:46.697
Well, we've both made
not-so-great choices in the past

17:50.303 --> 17:53.271
and we're self-conscious about
everypony judging us

17:53.473 --> 17:55.106
even though we've
both changed

17:55.308 --> 17:57.508
and are trying hard
to be better.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.477
Yeah... we don't really have that.

18:05.951 --> 18:08.852
Hmph! I can think of
something you have in common.

18:10.355 --> 18:13.824
You're both poor
practice audiences.

18:16.461 --> 18:18.729
Starlight and I don't really
have a lot in common.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.465
Other than feeling
different from most ponies.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.000
And comedy.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.101
Comedy?

18:26.171 --> 18:27.371
I'm very funny.

18:27.673 --> 18:28.572
Was that a joke?

18:28.674 --> 18:29.274
No.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.376
Well, that's more
than I can think of

18:31.478 --> 18:32.876
that she and I
have in common.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.980
We don't really spend that much
time talking about that, though.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.549
Mostly we're just comfortable
around each other.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.651
[sigh] We used to be...

18:40.953 --> 18:42.420
We did everything together.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.089
But now I'm wondering if we've
spent so much time apart

18:45.191 --> 18:46.957
that we don't connect
over anything anymore

18:47.059 --> 18:48.292
and if we can't
connect over anything

18:48.394 --> 18:50.061
then maybe we're
not even friends!

18:50.263 --> 18:52.563
Well, at least
it's not serious.

18:53.832 --> 18:55.632
That.. was a joke.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.538
[sigh] I appreciate you trying
to help, Twilight.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.642
But it seems pretty clear that
Sunburst and I have grown apart.

19:04.944 --> 19:05.944
I understand.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.013
But I feel like that only
happens if you both let it.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.182
You still want to
be friends, right?

19:11.484 --> 19:14.385
I created a spell so we could
re-live playing a game

19:14.487 --> 19:16.020
in our childhood home...

19:16.322 --> 19:17.722
and bodies.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.724
Right....

19:20.126 --> 19:23.094
I'm just not sure Sunburst
wants to stay friends too.

19:23.296 --> 19:26.196
I think you might
be surprised.

19:27.532 --> 19:29.700
Prepare yourself...

19:29.802 --> 19:32.002
For the new
and improved

19:32.204 --> 19:33.804
Dragon Pit!

19:36.541 --> 19:38.976
We had to take out a few
spaces to get it to fit

19:39.078 --> 19:40.544
but you hardly miss them.

19:41.046 --> 19:42.413
Maud made the dice.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.086
Pumice is the
lightest igneous rock.

19:49.288 --> 19:50.688
It seems the
best choice.

19:53.058 --> 19:55.826
And I added the special effects.

19:56.228 --> 19:59.497
There's nothing like a little
well-placed magic smoke.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.968
Looks like somepony's dragon
is going to get trapped.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.804
I thought you didn't
wanna play this game.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.473
Well, I didn't want to
pretend to be a foal,

20:09.575 --> 20:11.175
but I know you
wanted to play.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.244
I thought it'd be fun to
play a version big enough

20:13.346 --> 20:14.678
for full grown ponies.

20:15.514 --> 20:16.314
What do you think?

20:16.616 --> 20:17.382
Fun, right?

20:22.622 --> 20:25.956
Actually, it's
missing something.

20:30.461 --> 20:30.994
AHHHGHHHHHH!

20:33.665 --> 20:35.399
[chuckle] Now it's fun.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.979
I don't know why I got
so worried about us

20:49.081 --> 20:50.715
not having anything
in common.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.417
Yeah. I kind of think
it doesn't matter

20:53.519 --> 20:55.486
as long as we enjoy
each other's company.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.555
Trixie: And that game was
certainly enjoyable.

21:00.025 --> 21:02.092
What made it even better
was getting to play it

21:02.194 --> 21:03.527
with all my friends.

21:10.202 --> 21:10.968
See you soon?

21:11.370 --> 21:12.070
You bet.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.238
I want to hear if you find
anything interesting

21:14.340 --> 21:15.273
in that barrel.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.907
Trust me, Starlight.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.476
You'll be the
first to know!
