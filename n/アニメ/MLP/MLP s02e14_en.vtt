00:42.485 --> 00:47.852
Applejack, you're sure to knock everypony's
hat off at the Equestria Rodeo competition!

00:47.853 --> 00:50.965
Aw shucks, Apple Bloom.
I sure hope so.

00:50.966 --> 00:53.356
Hope so?
I know so!

00:53.357 --> 00:57.546
After all, you're the ten-time
rodeo champion of Ponyville!

00:57.547 --> 01:02.196
Why, you got more blue ribbons
than anypony in Ponyville ever!

01:02.197 --> 01:06.430
And I can't wait for my big sis' to
win every blue ribbon in Equestria...

01:06.431 --> 01:11.809
...and bring home the title of
Equestria Rodeo Champion.

01:55.678 --> 01:58.406
Now, careful, Derpy!

01:58.607 --> 02:01.622
Don't want to do any more damage
than you've already done...

02:04.713 --> 02:07.481
I just don't know what went wrong.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.572
Yeah. It's a mystery.

02:12.789 --> 02:15.928
Nice work, Rainbow Dash.

02:25.287 --> 02:30.267
You okay, Rainbow Dash?
Anything I can do to help?

02:31.468 --> 02:33.102
No! Nothing!

02:33.103 --> 02:36.824
In the name of Celestia,
just sit there and do nothing.

02:40.245 --> 02:42.591
Oops. My bad.

02:42.592 --> 02:47.766
Applejack!
Applejack!

02:47.767 --> 02:50.706
Everypony, can I get your attention?

02:50.707 --> 02:52.206
Attention please!

02:52.207 --> 02:55.716
Yes, we are all here to send
Applejack to compete...

02:55.717 --> 03:00.447
...in this year's Equestria Rodeo
competition in Canterlot.

03:04.312 --> 03:08.138
And, I want to thank Applejack in advance...

03:08.139 --> 03:12.913
...for generously offering up
her prize money to fix town hall.

03:13.214 --> 03:16.571
Yeah, Applejack!
Whoohoo!

03:22.297 --> 03:24.201
Speech!
Speech!

03:24.202 --> 03:27.320
Oh, shucks.
I'm not much for speeches.

03:27.721 --> 03:29.377
Alright then, no speech!

03:29.378 --> 03:35.359
But, this is the nicest send off
anypony could ask for.

03:35.360 --> 03:39.619
Y'all have been cheering me on in every
rodeo since I was a little little pony.

03:39.620 --> 03:45.247
So it seems only fittin' to use
my winnings to fix up town hall.

03:45.248 --> 03:48.339
I promise to make Ponyville proud.

03:55.307 --> 04:02.584
I want you to show all them high-falutin'
rodeo ponies what a real rodeo pony's like!

04:02.585 --> 04:04.279
You betcha, Granny Smith.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.830
And bring back all that money!

04:06.831 --> 04:08.524
You betcha, Mayor.

04:08.525 --> 04:10.576
And have fun.
And don't be nervous.

04:10.577 --> 04:14.637
Or barf. Use that nervous energy to do
even better than you already would!

04:14.638 --> 04:18.091
And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy
and taffy gives lots of nervous energy!

04:20.130 --> 04:24.263
- Just do your best, Applejack.
- I'll do better than my best!

04:24.264 --> 04:26.516
The train to Canterlot is about to leave!

04:26.517 --> 04:29.075
All aboard who's coming aboard!

04:29.076 --> 04:30.730
Guess that means me.

04:30.731 --> 04:32.231
See ya in a week!

04:32.232 --> 04:33.932
With lots of new blue ribbons!

04:33.933 --> 04:35.933
And lots of money!

04:35.934 --> 04:37.434
Darn tootin'!

04:44.315 --> 04:48.649
See y'all in a week, with a
big bag full of blue ribbons!

04:50.343 --> 04:52.455
And drink sarsaparilla!

04:52.956 --> 04:55.519
What? It gives you extra sass.

05:00.849 --> 05:04.153
I hope Applejack is surprised
by this surprise party!

05:04.154 --> 05:06.328
Well, that is the point.

05:06.329 --> 05:10.080
I know, but I hope she isn't
so surprised she's startled.

05:10.081 --> 05:11.781
Because while being surprised can be nice...

05:11.782 --> 05:14.910
...being startled can be very startling.

05:14.911 --> 05:16.411
Surprise!

05:17.212 --> 05:19.735
Oh, Pinkie, you startled me.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.641
Sorry! I was just practicing my "surprise!"
for when we surprise Applejack...

05:22.642 --> 05:27.949
...with this super cool party for becoming
rodeo champion of Equestria! Surprise!

05:28.250 --> 05:30.765
Quiet, Pinkie.
I think Applejack's coming!

05:31.166 --> 05:34.408
Don't worry, Twilight.
Got my lips all limbered up!

05:48.609 --> 05:51.219
SURPRISE!

05:51.220 --> 05:52.203
Surprise!

05:52.204 --> 05:53.504
Shoot!

05:54.312 --> 05:56.824
Wow, this is the best surprise ever!

05:56.825 --> 05:58.825
How did you know it was my birthday?

06:07.517 --> 06:10.020
Who's it from, Twilight?
What's it say?

06:10.021 --> 06:11.421
It's from Applejack.

06:11.422 --> 06:14.676
"Family and friends, not
coming back to Ponyville."

06:14.677 --> 06:16.964
"Don't worry, will send money soon."

06:17.365 --> 06:19.058
That's all there is.

06:20.774 --> 06:24.139
Applejack's... not comin' back?

06:24.140 --> 06:27.189
What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?!

06:27.190 --> 06:28.931
She loves Ponyville!

06:28.932 --> 06:31.710
And she loves Sweet Apple Acres!

06:31.711 --> 06:34.435
And she loves her family!

06:35.359 --> 06:39.389
Something just dreadful must have happened
to Applejack to make her not return!

06:39.390 --> 06:42.514
Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!

06:42.515 --> 06:46.170
So, what are we waiting for?
Let's go find her!

06:46.171 --> 06:49.485
Don't worry. We'll search all of
Equestria if we have to.

06:49.486 --> 06:50.965
We'll bring her back.

06:50.966 --> 06:52.466
Y'all are the best.

06:52.467 --> 06:54.067
Thank you, girls!

06:59.383 --> 07:02.887
Our little bushel just lost one apple.

08:07.249 --> 08:09.782
I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end.

08:09.783 --> 08:13.090
I don't wanna go home empty-hooved
after promising we'd find her.

08:13.091 --> 08:15.826
I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family.

08:15.827 --> 08:17.884
I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville!

08:17.885 --> 08:20.565
I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!

08:23.489 --> 08:25.173
This is Dodge Junction, girls.

08:25.174 --> 08:28.278
Applejack is supposed to have
come here after the rodeo ended.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.976
Let's fan out and try to find her.

08:34.477 --> 08:35.577
Pickles!

08:36.601 --> 08:37.966
Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry!

08:37.967 --> 08:39.467
Hurry it up in there!

08:40.723 --> 08:43.022
Some ponies. Sheesh.

08:44.771 --> 08:46.159
Applejack!

08:46.160 --> 08:50.385
I found her, I found her, I found her,
I found her, I found her!

08:52.515 --> 08:54.760
Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!

08:54.761 --> 08:56.361
We're so glad you're safe!

08:56.362 --> 08:58.951
I found her, I found her,
I found her, I found her!

09:00.600 --> 09:01.686
Be right back.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.842
Uh, hey, everypony.

09:04.843 --> 09:06.243
What's up?

09:06.244 --> 09:08.144
Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?!

09:08.145 --> 09:10.309
Yes, why are you here?

09:10.310 --> 09:11.710
Are you okay?

09:11.711 --> 09:13.011
Do you have any snacks?

09:13.012 --> 09:14.912
Tell us what happened, Applejack!

09:15.745 --> 09:19.469
Applejack? Are these some
of your Ponyville friends?

09:19.470 --> 09:20.570
Yes ma'am.

09:20.571 --> 09:22.071
And you are...?

09:22.072 --> 09:25.849
Why, I'm Cherry Jubilee,
boss at Cherry-o Range.

09:25.850 --> 09:27.750
Hasn't Applejack told ya?

09:27.751 --> 09:30.822
I saw her compete at the Equestria Rodeo.

09:30.823 --> 09:35.221
Never saw anypony win so
many ribbons in all my life.

09:35.222 --> 09:38.631
Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee.
You don't have to go into all that.

09:38.632 --> 09:40.432
Oh, she's so modest.

09:40.433 --> 09:44.652
Anyway, I can always use a pony with
quick hooves and a strong back.

09:44.653 --> 09:47.716
So, when I heard Applejack was
looking for a change of scenery...

09:47.717 --> 09:51.600
...I snapped her up as quick as I could
and brought her to Dodge Junction.

09:51.601 --> 09:54.106
Well, I'll let you catch up with your friends.

09:54.107 --> 09:55.707
See you back at the ranch.

09:56.545 --> 10:00.032
"Change of scenery"?
What's that supposed to mean?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.374
No big deal, guys.

10:01.375 --> 10:03.762
I thought cherries would be
a nice change from apples...

10:03.763 --> 10:07.059
...so I took the job and came here.
That's it. End of story.

10:07.060 --> 10:10.040
That's it? Well, that's a terrible story!

10:10.041 --> 10:11.957
Sorry, but that's all there is to tell.

10:11.958 --> 10:15.084
Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now.

10:15.085 --> 10:18.100
Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing okay.

10:18.101 --> 10:23.205
Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel
all over Equestria searching for you...

10:23.206 --> 10:24.706
...to come home without you!

10:24.707 --> 10:27.217
Well I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me!

10:27.218 --> 10:31.034
There is nothin' to tell and I am
not going back to Ponyville!

10:31.635 --> 10:35.433
I don't care what she says,
Applejack's not telling us something.

10:35.434 --> 10:38.454
Twilight's right. We gotta
get her to spill the beans!

10:38.455 --> 10:40.615
What?! She had beans?

10:40.616 --> 10:43.415
I told her I was snacky!

10:44.370 --> 10:46.807
You ready to put your back into it, Applejack?

10:46.808 --> 10:48.308
Sure am, Miss Jubilee.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.449
Terrific. Come on in, girls!

10:54.175 --> 10:56.366
What are you all doing here?

10:56.367 --> 10:57.967
We're your cherry sorters.

10:58.561 --> 11:00.857
- Shall we get started?
- Fine!

11:00.858 --> 11:04.093
Red cherries go in one bin and
yellow cherries go in the other.

11:04.094 --> 11:05.794
Simple as cherry pie.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.057
What are you five up to?

11:15.058 --> 11:18.672
You made working on a cherry
orchard sound... so delightful.

11:19.795 --> 11:23.600
Well, just remember :
no talking about Ponyville.

11:23.601 --> 11:24.601
Fine!

11:24.602 --> 11:26.823
Why don't you quit talking and get walking?

11:50.204 --> 11:53.330
So, AJ... how was Canterlot?

11:54.998 --> 11:57.287
Not talking about Ponyville,
talking about Canterlot...

11:57.288 --> 11:58.488
...totally different town.

11:58.489 --> 11:59.989
Canterlot was fine.

11:59.990 --> 12:01.490
Was the rodeo fun?

12:01.491 --> 12:02.491
Yes.

12:03.092 --> 12:05.213
Did you meet some nice ponies there?

12:05.214 --> 12:06.414
Some.

12:06.815 --> 12:09.318
Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok?

12:09.319 --> 12:10.925
What about Calamity Mane?

12:10.926 --> 12:12.300
Yes, saw 'em both.

12:17.809 --> 12:20.004
And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?

12:20.304 --> 12:23.204
Well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo.

12:23.204 --> 12:24.254
Real good treats.

12:25.884 --> 12:28.084
Um, excuse me?

12:28.084 --> 12:30.834
Cherry links, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.514
We struck up a conversation
being orchard folk and all.

12:33.514 --> 12:35.674
So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?

12:35.674 --> 12:36.294
Yes.

12:36.294 --> 12:38.594
Did you tell her why you weren't going back?

12:38.594 --> 12:40.834
No, 'cuz it was none of her business!

12:41.334 --> 12:44.624
Can you please slow down?

12:44.624 --> 12:47.644
Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?

12:47.644 --> 12:48.374
No!

12:58.144 --> 12:59.454
Is it because you were insulted when...

12:59.454 --> 13:01.484
...I gave you that book on organized orchards?

13:01.484 --> 13:02.444
No!

13:07.154 --> 13:10.664
Is it because you were insulted
when I insulted your hair?

13:10.664 --> 13:12.194
No, no, NO!

13:12.194 --> 13:13.844
I'm not telling you why, so just...

13:13.844 --> 13:14.934
Stop!

13:29.194 --> 13:32.019
Well, girls, we seem to be striking out.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.455
That's 'cause we're playing too nice.

13:34.456 --> 13:38.121
Yes. Desperate times do call
for desperate measures.

13:38.122 --> 13:41.118
It's time to call in the big guns.

13:54.715 --> 13:56.690
Hey Applejack.
Need some help?

13:56.691 --> 13:59.087
You promise not to ask me any questions?

13:59.088 --> 14:00.344
I promise.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.927
Have you ever had a cherry chonga?

14:08.928 --> 14:10.928
Oh! Sorry, that was a question.

14:10.929 --> 14:12.829
That kind of question is fine, Pinkie.

14:12.830 --> 14:15.182
No, I never had a cherry chonga.

14:15.183 --> 14:17.852
Well no wonder, because I made it up myself!

14:17.853 --> 14:20.935
A cherry chonga is mashed up
cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried.

14:20.936 --> 14:23.097
Cherry chonga. Great name, huh?

14:23.098 --> 14:24.603
Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimmy cherry.

14:24.604 --> 14:27.080
Oh, that's good too. Which
do you think sounds better?

14:27.081 --> 14:28.381
Cherry chonga or chimmy cherry?

14:28.382 --> 14:30.382
Or what if I combine them?
Chimmy cherry chonga!

14:30.383 --> 14:33.853
What sounds the funniest?
I like funny words!

14:33.854 --> 14:35.751
One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'!

14:35.752 --> 14:36.924
I didn't make that one up.

14:36.925 --> 14:40.332
I would work in a kumquat orchard
just so I could say 'kumquat' all day!

14:40.333 --> 14:42.586
Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat!

14:43.287 --> 14:46.781
And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that
just the funnest thing to say?

14:46.782 --> 14:48.282
Pickle barrel pickle barrel pickle barrel.

14:48.283 --> 14:49.783
Say it with me!

14:49.784 --> 14:53.285
Pickle barrel kumquat, pickle barrel kumquat,
pickle barrel kumquat, chimmy cherry chonga!

14:53.286 --> 14:55.956
No! Make it stop, make it stop!

14:55.957 --> 14:59.582
The only way to make it stop
is for you to spill the beans.

14:59.583 --> 15:00.383
Never!

15:01.169 --> 15:04.780
Speaking of beans, did you ever realize
how many words rhyme with 'beans'?

15:04.781 --> 15:08.734
- Lean, mean, spleen, I'm queen, bean...
- Alright, alright!

15:08.735 --> 15:10.618
I'll tell everypony what's goin' on!

15:10.619 --> 15:13.019
Just please stop talkin'!

15:13.420 --> 15:17.613
But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at
breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out.

15:17.614 --> 15:20.967
Tomorrow, huh?
I don't know...

15:20.968 --> 15:22.579
Do you Pinkie promise?

15:24.956 --> 15:28.748
I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast.

15:28.749 --> 15:30.349
Pinkie promise.

15:37.860 --> 15:40.916
I'm glad we're finally gonna get
some answers from Applejack.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.666
Yeah, maybe.

15:43.667 --> 15:48.273
Don't worry, Rainbow. She's gotta
'fess up after making a Pinkie promise.

15:50.397 --> 15:52.772
Good morning, Applejack. You ready for...

15:58.429 --> 16:01.373
Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!

16:06.761 --> 16:08.676
Applejack!

16:09.277 --> 16:11.509
You Pinkie promised!

16:13.375 --> 16:15.469
Applejack, come back here!

16:15.470 --> 16:18.594
Giddy up, fellas, I gotta
get the heck out of Dodge!

16:19.745 --> 16:21.651
She's gonna get away!

16:22.449 --> 16:25.110
Oh no, she won't!
Look, girls!

16:26.915 --> 16:28.707
Follow that stagecoach!

16:38.676 --> 16:40.852
We have you now!

17:02.552 --> 17:03.821
What the hay?

17:04.122 --> 17:05.551
Pull over!

17:06.651 --> 17:08.544
Hey! Cut that out!

17:10.432 --> 17:12.432
I'll pay you double to outrun them.

17:13.339 --> 17:15.717
We'll pay you triple to slow down!

17:17.997 --> 17:21.071
I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!

17:25.540 --> 17:27.113
That was rude!

17:27.114 --> 17:29.673
Get them!
Get them!

17:29.936 --> 17:31.819
Come on, Fluttershy!

17:39.159 --> 17:41.204
C'mon, y'all!
Go, go!

17:44.835 --> 17:49.060
Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize!

17:49.061 --> 17:51.145
Pinkie, I did not break my promise!

17:51.146 --> 17:52.146
Wha?

17:52.147 --> 17:56.985
If y'all reckon back, I told you that I'd
tell you everything at breakfast.

17:56.986 --> 17:58.413
But I didn't come to breakfast.

17:58.414 --> 18:02.648
I couldn't come to that breakfast, not
if it meant telling y'all what happened.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.249
Well, I... I...

18:04.250 --> 18:08.666
I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell
y'all the truth. I just can't.

18:08.667 --> 18:11.755
Well I heard a sorry in there,
so that'll have to do for now.

18:11.756 --> 18:14.077
I'll get a real apology later.
Rarity, catch me.

18:14.078 --> 18:15.678
What? Pinkie!

18:16.764 --> 18:18.580
Rainbow, go back!

18:18.581 --> 18:21.421
No time! They knew what
they were getting into!

18:55.126 --> 18:57.466
Lady, you're trouble.

19:00.337 --> 19:02.231
Try and catch me now.

19:04.234 --> 19:05.474
Oh, nuts.

19:14.023 --> 19:15.618
Not so fast!

19:22.333 --> 19:24.793
Fine. Now you know.

19:24.794 --> 19:26.156
Know what?

19:26.820 --> 19:28.504
Well, just look!

19:29.178 --> 19:34.553
I am. You won an amazing number of
ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!

19:34.554 --> 19:37.969
Don't you get it? There's every
color of ribbon down there.

19:38.170 --> 19:41.887
Every color... but... blue.

19:42.188 --> 19:46.690
I came in fourth, third, even second.

19:46.691 --> 19:51.861
But I didn't win one first prize... and I
certainly didn't win any prize money.

19:51.862 --> 19:54.688
But the telegram said you were gonna send money.

19:54.689 --> 19:58.228
That's why I came here.
I wanted to earn some money.

19:58.229 --> 20:01.000
After that big old send off Ponyville gave me...

20:01.001 --> 20:03.843
...I just didn't have the nerve
to come home empty-hooved.

20:03.844 --> 20:06.009
I couldn't come home a failure.

20:07.124 --> 20:09.606
Applejack, you're not a failure.

20:09.607 --> 20:11.107
And we're your friends!

20:11.108 --> 20:14.111
We don't care if you came in fiftieth place!

20:14.112 --> 20:16.593
You're still number one in our books.

20:16.694 --> 20:20.135
So... you're not upset, or disappointed?

20:22.026 --> 20:23.841
But what about the mayor?

20:23.842 --> 20:27.954
I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't
get that money to fix the broken roof.

20:27.955 --> 20:32.473
Applejack, we can always find a
way to fix that hole in the roof.

20:32.474 --> 20:37.775
But if you don't come back, we'll never
be able to fix the hole in our hearts.

20:41.643 --> 20:45.523
Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!

20:48.447 --> 20:50.399
"Dear Princess Celestia..."

20:50.400 --> 20:55.343
"...it's a tad easier to be proud when you come
in first than it is when you finish further back."

20:55.344 --> 20:59.129
"But there's no reason to hide when
you don't do as well as you'd hoped."

21:00.041 --> 21:02.635
"You can't run away from your problems."

21:03.277 --> 21:06.200
"Better to run to your friends and family."

21:11.878 --> 21:13.312
What did you think, Rarity?

21:13.313 --> 21:16.480
Chimmy cherry, or cherry chonga?
Chimmy cherry, cherry chonga?

21:16.481 --> 21:20.970
Chimmy cherry, cherry chonga?
Chimmy cherry, cherry chonga?

21:20.970 --> 21:24.540
When I get back, you're
gonna get it, Rainbow Dash!
