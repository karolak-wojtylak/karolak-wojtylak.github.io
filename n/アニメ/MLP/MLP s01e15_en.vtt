WEBVTT

00:10.803 --> 00:13.126
-Eyes over here, Spike!
-Uh, sorry.

00:13.199 --> 00:16.364
For this to work, it's crucial we keep
our concentration totally on the...

00:16.365 --> 00:17.095
Ooh!

00:19.370 --> 00:22.869
Spike! This magic needs
our full attention to make it happen!

00:22.990 --> 00:24.357
There's no other way.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.482
I can't help it.

00:25.990 --> 00:26.876
Look!

00:38.363 --> 00:41.120
Never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie.

00:41.204 --> 00:43.549
Super extra Pinkie Pie today.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.166
Twitchy-twitcha-twitcha-twitch.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.270
Pinkie Pie. What in the wide, wide
world of Equestria are you up to?

00:54.374 --> 00:56.178
Oh! It's my tail! It's my tail!

00:56.179 --> 00:58.621
It's a-twitchy-twitching!
And you know what that means.

00:59.353 --> 01:02.277
Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea.

01:02.314 --> 01:05.819
The twitching means my Pinkie Sense is telling me
that stuff's gonna start falling!

01:06.185 --> 01:07.703
You should better duck for cover.

01:08.010 --> 01:10.267
Oh, Pinkie. It's not gonna rain.

01:10.268 --> 01:11.993
Weather's barely even a cloud in the...

01:14.960 --> 01:17.450
He just said "Nice catch" in Frog.

01:57.696 --> 02:00.705
Oh. I'm so, so sorry.

02:00.805 --> 02:02.787
You okay, Twilight Sparkle?

02:02.853 --> 02:06.521
I just couldn't stand to see
the pond getting so overpopulated...

02:06.522 --> 02:09.119
...what with the frogs all
hopping into each other and all...

02:09.120 --> 02:13.165
...so I decided to fly as many as I can
on over to Froggy Bottom Bog.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.650
Of course you did.

02:14.894 --> 02:15.850
Bye bye.

02:18.807 --> 02:22.495
Um, Twilight? You've got a little
something on your face there.

02:22.496 --> 02:26.069
Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense
tell you that too?

02:26.148 --> 02:28.025
Nah, I could just see it.

02:31.446 --> 02:35.542
Come on, Spike. Let's continue our practice
session where there's a little less commotion.

02:36.082 --> 02:37.966
Wow! That was amazing!

02:37.967 --> 02:40.601
Pinkie Pie predicted something
would fall and it did!

02:40.767 --> 02:43.342
Oh, come on. She said something would fall...

02:43.343 --> 02:46.695
...and a frog just happened to fall
right around the same time.

02:46.773 --> 02:49.176
A coincidence. Nothing else to it.

02:49.536 --> 02:52.475
My tail! My tail! Twitcha-twitch! Twitcha-twitch!

02:52.797 --> 02:54.524
Something else is gonna fall!

02:54.772 --> 02:56.447
Oh, Pinkie, please.

02:56.448 --> 02:59.103
Nothing else is gonna faaaAAAH... Ugh!

02:59.676 --> 03:01.434
Oh no! Twilight fell!

03:01.747 --> 03:03.701
Is it... safe to go help her?

03:03.702 --> 03:05.697
It's okay. My tail stopped twitching.

03:10.976 --> 03:12.238
That was amazing!

03:12.397 --> 03:13.787
Oh, please.

03:13.788 --> 03:16.539
Uh, Twilight? Why are you hangin' out in a ditch?

03:16.733 --> 03:18.778
Because Pinkie Pie predicted it.

03:18.779 --> 03:21.050
Honestly, Spike, she did not.

03:21.125 --> 03:24.084
Two coincidences in a row
like this may be unlikely...

03:24.085 --> 03:28.008
...but it's still easier to believe than
twitchy tails that predict the future.

03:29.007 --> 03:31.368
Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense?

03:33.725 --> 03:36.697
Don't worry. It's safe.
Prediction already came true.

03:36.902 --> 03:40.406
Oh, wait. Don't tell me
you believe in this stuff too.

03:40.433 --> 03:44.179
I know it doesn't make much sense,
but those of us, who've been Ponyville a while...

03:44.180 --> 03:48.243
...have learned over time that
if Pinkie's a-twitchin', you better listen.

03:48.552 --> 03:50.815
My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!

03:51.846 --> 03:53.167
What does that mean?!

03:53.891 --> 03:55.393
I'll start a bath for you.

03:55.453 --> 03:56.213
HUH?!

03:57.055 --> 04:00.998
A bath? This thing keeps on
getting more ridiculous by the minute.

04:05.759 --> 04:07.804
So basically it works like this:

04:07.805 --> 04:11.174
I get different little niggly feelings
and they mean different things.

04:11.175 --> 04:14.407
Like when my back is itchy,
it means it's my lucky day!

04:14.408 --> 04:18.678
And when my knee gets pinchy, that means
something scary is about to happen.

04:18.943 --> 04:20.560
Is your knee pinchy now?

04:20.945 --> 04:25.030
No. But my shoulder's achy.
That means there's an alligator in the tub.

04:28.411 --> 04:30.327
How come your knee didn't get pinchy?!

04:30.328 --> 04:33.447
That isn't just scary. It downright dangerous!

04:33.532 --> 04:37.124
No, it's not, silly.
This is my pet alligator, Gummy.

04:37.125 --> 04:39.100
He's got no teeth. See?

04:40.065 --> 04:42.263
Okay, okay. I get it.

04:44.204 --> 04:48.090
Well, I still don't believe
all this "special power" stuff.

04:48.091 --> 04:50.008
It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.

04:50.009 --> 04:53.712
What's not to believe? You do magic.
What's the difference?

04:54.316 --> 04:55.213
Huge!

04:55.313 --> 04:56.169
For one thing...

05:00.217 --> 05:02.842
Magic is something you study and practice.

05:02.843 --> 05:04.904
It only happens when you decide to do it.

05:04.905 --> 05:08.910
And it's meant to make something specific,
that you choose to happen, happen.

05:09.047 --> 05:11.688
With you... it makes no sense at all!

05:11.960 --> 05:14.838
That so not true, Twilight.

05:15.552 --> 05:18.352
Sometimes it's a *bunch* of random things
happening to my body...

05:18.353 --> 05:20.678
...at random times that
supposedly predict the future.

05:20.679 --> 05:22.482
I call them combos.

05:22.700 --> 05:23.722
Combos?

05:23.723 --> 05:27.616
Sure! You know, like ear flop,
then knee twitch, then eye flutter?

05:27.716 --> 05:31.575
That means the sky is about to
be graced with a beautiful rainbow!

05:31.576 --> 05:32.933
Yeah. Sure.

05:32.934 --> 05:35.342
Uh-oh. I feel a combo coming on.

05:35.787 --> 05:38.683
Ear flop... Eye flutter... Knee twitch...

05:44.987 --> 05:48.760
You said that combo meant beautiful rainbow.

05:48.873 --> 05:53.106
Oh, nonononono. You're thinking of an ear flop,
then knee twitch, then eye flutter.

05:53.107 --> 05:56.117
This was an ear flop,
then eye flutter, then knee twitch.

05:56.118 --> 05:58.486
That usually means "Look out for opening doors."

05:58.865 --> 05:59.875
You okay?

06:00.080 --> 06:02.274
I don't believe this.

06:02.470 --> 06:05.381
You don't believe, because you don't understand.

06:15.484 --> 06:17.699
Okay. Now when you get another twitch...

06:17.700 --> 06:20.314
...we'll have all kinds of scientific information.

06:20.442 --> 06:22.158
Okie dokie lokie!

06:28.010 --> 06:29.198
Any twitches yet?

06:29.199 --> 06:30.742
Nopie dopie!

06:34.170 --> 06:36.268
Now? Anything?

06:37.371 --> 06:38.611
Wait! Hold on...

06:40.205 --> 06:41.194
Uh, no.

06:41.195 --> 06:45.471
Are you kidding me?
After a whole day of nonstop twitching...

06:45.472 --> 06:48.231
...now that I've got you all hooked up,
you're not getting a single one?

06:48.517 --> 06:50.712
I don't control it. They just come and go.

06:50.713 --> 06:52.017
That makes no sense!

06:52.096 --> 06:54.170
Sometimes you just have to believe in things.

06:54.171 --> 06:55.918
Even when you can't figure 'em out.

06:55.919 --> 06:59.263
I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.

06:59.264 --> 07:02.796
Wait! Hold on... I'm feeling something.

07:02.970 --> 07:05.083
Omygosh! What? What is it?

07:07.276 --> 07:08.432
It's my tummy!

07:08.433 --> 07:10.819
That usually means I'm hungry. Let's eat!

07:11.774 --> 07:12.755
You know what?

07:14.435 --> 07:15.389
Just forget it.

07:15.390 --> 07:17.402
I don't need to know if this is real or not.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.890
I don't need to understand it. I don't even care!

07:21.621 --> 07:23.259
Okie dokie lokie!

07:29.695 --> 07:30.502
Uh-oh!

07:36.206 --> 07:38.247
Pinkie, have you seen Twili...?

07:38.339 --> 07:39.275
Uh-huh.

07:41.469 --> 07:43.729
Twilight? What are you doing back there?

07:45.385 --> 07:47.634
Did you two plan this?

07:47.850 --> 07:48.930
Plan what?

07:50.596 --> 07:54.775
This is ridiculous! This can't be happening!
This makes no sense!

07:55.129 --> 07:57.315
I have to figure this out.

08:33.477 --> 08:34.286
Twilight?

08:37.146 --> 08:40.226
Honestly, Spike, don't you know better
than to sneak up on ponies?

08:40.227 --> 08:41.869
Oh! Sorry, but...

08:42.187 --> 08:45.333
Um... Well... Isn't that what you're doing?

08:46.892 --> 08:47.792
No.

08:48.471 --> 08:50.598
I'm doing scientific research.

08:50.599 --> 08:56.824
I'm observing Pinkie Pie (scientific name:
Pinkius Piecus) in its natural habitat.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.780
Pinkius Whoecus?

08:59.754 --> 09:03.129
There's something fishy going on
with the whole twitchy prediction thing.

09:03.130 --> 09:05.133
And I'm getting to the bottom of it.

09:05.387 --> 09:06.624
So shhh!

09:08.686 --> 09:11.604
Come on! Pinkius Piecus is on the move.

09:19.807 --> 09:21.260
Itchy nose.

09:27.235 --> 09:29.350
Aha! That makes no sense.

09:29.351 --> 09:32.218
See? She's hiding like something's
about to fall from the sky...

09:32.219 --> 09:36.404
...but a twitchy *tail* means something's
gonna fall from the sky. Not an itchy nose.

09:41.185 --> 09:43.590
This proves, perhaps conclusively, that...

09:44.946 --> 09:46.706
Spike! Where are you going?

09:46.707 --> 09:48.821
I'm trying to teach you
the value of scientific obse...

09:54.885 --> 09:56.303
What's she doing now?

09:56.804 --> 09:57.840
Smelling a flower.

09:57.841 --> 10:00.488
Holy guacamole! I don't know what that means.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.725
Probably that the flower smells good.

10:03.464 --> 10:05.245
Wait! I'm getting something.

10:05.493 --> 10:08.639
Ear flop... eye flutter... knee twitch.

10:08.981 --> 10:09.885
Hold on...

10:09.964 --> 10:13.582
You told me that's the combo
that says "Watch out for opening doors."

10:15.151 --> 10:18.495
You really, really believe this stuff, don't you?

10:18.705 --> 10:21.862
Here. Let me show you
there's nothing to be afraid of.

10:22.298 --> 10:23.192
You see?

10:23.449 --> 10:26.711
I promise you there's nothing
to fear from that... whoaaa...!

10:29.050 --> 10:33.017
Twilight! You came to visit
my new apple cellar. How nice.

10:33.662 --> 10:36.609
Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?

10:38.970 --> 10:40.832
Here. Let me help ya.

10:43.350 --> 10:44.264
Okay.

10:44.874 --> 10:45.897
Take this down.

10:46.892 --> 10:48.234
Twitchy... tail.

10:48.751 --> 10:49.738
Twitchy tail?

10:50.168 --> 10:51.486
TWITCHY TAIL!!!

10:52.105 --> 10:54.827
Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie
know we're here, remember?

10:54.828 --> 10:56.883
Something's gonna fall! Something's gonna fall!

10:56.884 --> 10:57.902
Run for your lives!

10:58.913 --> 11:02.028
Ugh... Spike, honestly, you're overreact...

11:12.909 --> 11:14.980
Hey, Applejack! Whatchu doin'?

11:15.180 --> 11:19.185
Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar.
How about you, Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?

11:19.375 --> 11:22.525
Oh. Letting Twilight secretly follow me
all day without me knowing.

11:22.953 --> 11:24.790
You mean you knew all along?!

11:25.381 --> 11:26.661
Why didn't you tell me?

11:27.029 --> 11:29.676
Silly. That would have spoiled the secret.

11:32.096 --> 11:33.860
Tail... still twitching?

11:34.077 --> 11:37.706
All done. Clear skies from here on in,
as far as I can tell.

11:39.961 --> 11:41.626
Oh no! What does that one mean?!

11:41.852 --> 11:44.188
Dunno. Never gotten any like it before.

11:44.189 --> 11:47.399
But whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy!

11:47.507 --> 11:49.825
Something you never expect
to happen is gonna happen!

11:53.117 --> 11:56.636
And it's gonna happen... at Froggy Bottom Bog!

11:57.580 --> 11:59.132
That's where Fluttershy's headed!

11:59.307 --> 12:01.110
Oh no! Is it about her?

12:01.343 --> 12:03.250
I... I'm not sure.

12:03.586 --> 12:05.434
We better go and make sure she's okay.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.713
Calm down, everypony. All we know right now...

12:08.714 --> 12:12.232
...is that Pinkie Pie just got
a case of the shivers. That's all.

12:17.459 --> 12:20.157
Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff.

12:20.199 --> 12:21.606
I don't.

12:21.696 --> 12:26.834
I just want to be there to see the look on
Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.

12:26.852 --> 12:28.127
Okie dokie!

12:50.665 --> 12:51.464
Cold?

12:51.465 --> 12:53.230
Need a jacket or something?

12:53.378 --> 12:55.149
No, thanks. I'm fine.

12:56.898 --> 12:59.438
So... what do you think happened to Fluttershy?

12:59.571 --> 13:00.646
I hope nothin'.

13:00.782 --> 13:03.030
I know, but... what do you *think* happened?

13:03.204 --> 13:04.629
I'm tryin' not to think about it.

13:05.561 --> 13:06.591
Me too.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.421
But... I'm thinking about it anyway.

13:09.432 --> 13:12.538
Like... what if... she exploded?!

13:12.788 --> 13:15.354
Just exploded? For no reason?

13:15.544 --> 13:17.697
Yeah! Like, boom!

13:17.795 --> 13:19.776
-Whoa!
-I know!

13:20.063 --> 13:24.646
What if... What if she exploded...
and then... and then exploded again?!

13:24.860 --> 13:27.238
Can you do that? Can you explode twice?

13:27.591 --> 13:28.685
Of course not.

13:28.984 --> 13:32.767
But what if... she exploded...
and exploded again... and then...

13:33.071 --> 13:35.150
Will you two stop?

13:35.397 --> 13:37.544
She's fine. I'm sure of it.

13:37.710 --> 13:40.323
I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake.

13:41.173 --> 13:43.247
Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bog!

13:46.723 --> 13:48.402
Fluttershy!

13:50.438 --> 13:51.421
Fluttershy!

13:59.218 --> 14:01.458
Fluttershy! You're okay!

14:02.293 --> 14:03.625
Of course.

14:04.331 --> 14:05.761
What a relief.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.932
I'm so glad everything's all right.

14:08.132 --> 14:10.930
Sorry. I know it's not nice to gloat, but...

14:11.297 --> 14:15.580
AHA! I told you there was nothing
to worry about and I was right.

14:15.672 --> 14:20.372
Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering
about was a *cough* doozy. And... *cough*

14:20.373 --> 14:24.048
And the only *cough* doozy here is how right I am.

14:24.473 --> 14:26.810
Um... Twilight?

14:26.920 --> 14:30.396
Pinkie's made a lot of predictions
today, but... *cough*

14:30.629 --> 14:32.373
What is that smell?!

14:32.609 --> 14:36.365
But what we've shown here is that
there's no point in believing... *cough*

14:36.366 --> 14:38.888
...anything you can't see for yourself.

14:39.135 --> 14:42.741
W-Well then, see what's b-behind you, Twilight.

14:45.309 --> 14:48.144
I see it... but I don't believe it!

14:52.689 --> 14:54.115
Is that a hydra?

14:54.116 --> 14:56.136
Who cares? RUUUN!!!

15:00.939 --> 15:02.724
Pinkie! Come on!

15:08.064 --> 15:10.105
Oh! I'm so sorry.

15:32.990 --> 15:34.383
Everypony up that hill!

15:34.384 --> 15:36.093
HEEELP!!!

15:38.408 --> 15:40.683
Coming, Spike! Hang on!

15:50.443 --> 15:52.049
I think we're gonna make it!

15:52.452 --> 15:54.204
But Pinkie's still shuddering!

15:57.433 --> 15:59.027
Oh, lookie there. It stopped.

15:59.930 --> 16:04.413
Ohhh, therrre ittt isss agggainnn!

16:15.242 --> 16:16.706
He'll be up here in no time!

16:16.819 --> 16:19.372
Quick! One at a time! Cross!

16:21.564 --> 16:24.319
Uh, do you know any spell
for turning a hydra into a mouse?

16:24.320 --> 16:25.891
-No.
-How about a squirrel?

16:25.892 --> 16:26.870
-No!
-How about...

16:26.871 --> 16:29.104
No small rodents of any kind!

16:29.105 --> 16:30.233
That's too bad.

16:30.539 --> 16:32.675
A hop, skip and a...

16:32.886 --> 16:33.753
JUMP!

16:36.605 --> 16:38.971
Wwwhoooa!

16:41.842 --> 16:42.925
He's too close!

16:43.125 --> 16:45.975
I'll distract him. You two go! Now!

16:46.674 --> 16:50.389
Oh... What would a brave pony
like Rainbow Dash do?

16:52.820 --> 16:55.174
CHAAARGE!!!

17:06.407 --> 17:08.722
Tttwilight!

17:34.822 --> 17:37.102
Tttwilight!

17:37.103 --> 17:38.608
You have to jump!

17:38.762 --> 17:40.157
I'll never make it!

17:40.317 --> 17:41.409
You'll be fine!

17:41.740 --> 17:43.164
I will not!

17:47.281 --> 17:50.084
It's your only hooope!

17:53.264 --> 17:55.355
You have to take a leap of faith!

18:05.251 --> 18:05.947
No!

18:10.808 --> 18:11.783
Oh no!

18:12.120 --> 18:14.270
NOOO!!!

18:25.658 --> 18:27.553
I knew you could do it, Twilight!

18:27.554 --> 18:31.356
I don't know how it happened.
Coincidence, dumb luck or what.

18:31.509 --> 18:34.377
But you said there'd be a doozy
here at Froggy Bottom Bog...

18:34.487 --> 18:37.308
...and I'd say we just had
ourselves one heck of a doozy.

18:37.309 --> 18:38.991
I mean, that hydra...

18:40.782 --> 18:41.660
Pinkie?

18:41.661 --> 18:42.652
That wasn't it.

18:42.748 --> 18:43.556
Huh?

18:43.775 --> 18:45.027
What wasn't what?

18:45.136 --> 18:47.230
What are you talkin' about, Pink?

18:47.515 --> 18:49.009
The hydra wasn't the doozy.

18:51.899 --> 18:53.669
I'm still getting the shudders.

18:56.086 --> 18:57.880
You see? There it is again.

18:57.899 --> 19:02.621
Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bog,
my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened.

19:02.965 --> 19:05.101
Huh... But I... WHAT?!

19:05.375 --> 19:07.285
The hydra... wasn't the doozy?

19:07.355 --> 19:09.191
How could it not be... the doozy?

19:09.315 --> 19:11.161
What could be doozier than that?!

19:11.418 --> 19:13.366
Dunno. But it just wasn't it.

19:22.220 --> 19:23.458
I give up.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.233
Give what up, Twi?

19:25.351 --> 19:28.013
The fight. I can't fight it anymore.

19:28.524 --> 19:31.079
I don't understand how, why or what...

19:31.236 --> 19:34.183
...but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense.

19:34.427 --> 19:36.878
I don't see how it does, but it just does.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.849
Just because I don't understand
doesn't mean it's not true.

19:40.046 --> 19:43.441
Yyyouuu mean yyyou bbbelllieve?

19:43.557 --> 19:46.107
Yep. I guess I do.

19:49.833 --> 19:50.624
Oh.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.591
That was it! That's the doozy!

19:57.429 --> 19:58.028
What?

19:58.327 --> 19:59.421
What is?

19:59.481 --> 20:00.974
You believing!

20:00.975 --> 20:03.276
I never expected *that* to happen.

20:03.277 --> 20:08.234
That was the doozy! Oh, and oh,
what a doozy of a doozy it was!

20:16.297 --> 20:18.380
Oh, good, Spike. You're here.

20:18.471 --> 20:19.447
Take a letter.

20:19.459 --> 20:20.832
With pleasure, Twilight.

20:20.850 --> 20:22.450
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:22.717 --> 20:24.328
"I'm happy to report, that..."

20:24.943 --> 20:27.830
Spike. What have I been saying about focus?

20:27.925 --> 20:30.400
I know, but I... well...

20:30.622 --> 20:34.072
What's wrong, Spike? Never thought
you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?

20:34.224 --> 20:35.826
Not really. No.

20:35.963 --> 20:38.439
Pinkie's tail's a-twitching. What else can I do?

20:44.540 --> 20:46.458
"I am happy to report that I now realize..."

20:46.459 --> 20:49.634
"...there are wonderful things
in this world you just can't explain."

20:49.637 --> 20:52.580
"But that doesn't necessarily
make them any less true."

20:53.345 --> 20:56.070
"It just means you have to
choose to believe in them."

20:56.071 --> 20:59.165
"And sometimes it takes a friend
to show you the way."

20:59.420 --> 21:00.518
HONK!

21:00.714 --> 21:01.651
"Honk."

21:01.676 --> 21:04.691
"Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

21:09.585 --> 21:11.096
There it goes again.

21:11.097 --> 21:13.802
I wonder what's gonna drop out
of the sky this time.

21:14.239 --> 21:16.048
You never know.

21:21.601 --> 21:22.648
Twitchy tail?

21:25.946 --> 21:27.541
Holy guacamole!

21:29.666 --> 21:33.166
