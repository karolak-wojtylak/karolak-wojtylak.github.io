00:06.253 --> 00:08.193
<i>Just one more time.</i>
<i>Please!</i>

00:08.948 --> 00:11.114
All right, but this
is the last one.

00:12.721 --> 00:13.871
Whoo hoo!

00:13.927 --> 00:15.709
Wheeeee!

00:21.184 --> 00:22.417
Oh dear me!

00:23.336 --> 00:25.270
Sure wish you'd come
swimmin' with us, Granny.

00:26.446 --> 00:29.988
Sorry, dear, but I just
can't bring myself anywhere

00:29.990 --> 00:31.822
near that there
swimmin' hole.

00:32.177 --> 00:32.991
How come?

00:33.650 --> 00:36.798
Well, I wasn't
always this way.

00:39.603 --> 00:43.964
<i>Time was, I was an</i>
<i>aqua-pony all star.</i>

00:45.806 --> 00:48.716
<i>In fact, I was the only</i>
<i>Apple to ever come close</i>

00:48.723 --> 00:51.601
<i>to breaking the Equestria</i>
<i>high diving record.</i>

00:56.033 --> 00:58.817
<i>Falling six stories into</i>
<i>a deep-dish pie pan</i>

00:58.827 --> 01:00.725
<i>takes a toll on</i>
<i>the hindquarters.</i>

01:01.440 --> 01:03.479
Oh, I was so sore,
it took years

01:03.482 --> 01:06.169
before I could even
look at the water again.

01:06.442 --> 01:09.953
Just the idea of swimming
makes my whole body ache.

01:10.905 --> 01:14.105
Besides, these old legs can't
even paddle fast enough

01:14.111 --> 01:15.516
to stay afloat.

01:19.215 --> 01:22.054
Boy, I sure would hate
to be afraid of swimming.

01:22.314 --> 01:24.208
Do you think I'll ever
be scared of the water?

01:26.345 --> 01:27.264
Aaah!

01:30.095 --> 01:30.663
Nnope.

01:40.056 --> 01:45.050

02:14.444 --> 02:15.611
<i>Wow, Granny.</i>

02:15.875 --> 02:17.832
I can't believe you
were a high diver.

02:18.220 --> 02:20.692
The best one in Ponyville.

02:20.936 --> 02:23.016
Do you think I could
be a high diver?

02:23.240 --> 02:23.836
Nnope.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.176
Absolutely not!

02:25.426 --> 02:25.740
But...

02:25.822 --> 02:28.563
Now you hold your horse
feathers, little seed.

02:28.807 --> 02:32.230
I never said being a high
diver was a smart decision.

02:32.316 --> 02:34.117
It's incredibly dangerous.

02:34.273 --> 02:35.049
I know, but--

02:35.080 --> 02:36.009
But nothin'!

02:36.220 --> 02:40.267
It is the riskiest, scariest,
darned fool thing I ever did do.

02:40.524 --> 02:43.518
That's not to say I don't wish
I was still young and spry

02:43.520 --> 02:45.877
and confident, but
let's leave the flying

02:45.884 --> 02:47.730
through the air to the pegasi.

02:48.747 --> 02:52.386
Wow, when you put it that
way, it doesn't sound so fun.

02:58.872 --> 03:01.240
Wow. I wonder where
everypony's heading.

03:10.602 --> 03:13.603
Now, where in Ponyville do
you two think you're going?

03:14.140 --> 03:17.525
Oh, quit being such a worry
worm and follow your ears.

03:18.007 --> 03:19.229
Come on, Applejack.

03:19.375 --> 03:20.509
Aren't you curious?

03:42.341 --> 03:43.293
Shhh!

03:51.584 --> 03:54.495
Thank you one and all for your
attendance and we guarantee that

03:54.507 --> 03:56.606

04:01.486 --> 04:02.874
The Flim Flam Brothers!

04:03.053 --> 04:04.817
This should be interesting.
Eeyup

04:05.045 --> 04:07.822
Welcome one and all to the
demonstration of a lifetime.

04:07.902 --> 04:09.806
A demonstration
of a better life.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.974
A demonstration
of a better time.

04:11.984 --> 04:14.230
And if we haven't captured
your interest just yet,

04:14.294 --> 04:16.874

unfortunate phenomenon

04:16.885 --> 04:18.579

that we will.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.292
A phenomenon?
What's that?

04:20.353 --> 04:22.653
It's a circumstance
perceptible by the senses,

04:22.753 --> 04:25.184

04:44.854 --> 04:47.184
but twisted hooves
and aching joints

04:47.192 --> 04:48.811

Eeyup.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.077
Ah! I just can't
believe all the things

07:35.080 --> 07:36.989
that Flim Flam tonic can do.

07:37.678 --> 07:40.503
When somepony says something's
too good to be true,

07:40.860 --> 07:42.503
it usually is.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.381
You mean Granny
wasted her money?

07:45.871 --> 07:48.743
Well, I don't know about that,
but I don't think there's a

07:48.759 --> 07:51.808
tonic in Equestria that can
make an old pony young again.

07:51.984 --> 07:53.908
<i>Howdeee!</i>

07:57.793 --> 07:58.946
Granny?

08:00.325 --> 08:02.491
Hang on now! We'll get you!

08:22.999 --> 08:26.156
Granny, I thought you were too
afraid of the water to swim!

08:26.380 --> 08:28.005
And what about your hip?

08:28.522 --> 08:31.527
Well, I reckon it might have
been a problem before I had

08:31.533 --> 08:34.259
myself a dose of that
there Flim Flam Tonic.

08:34.718 --> 08:37.375
I'm not so sure that tonic
really does anything.

08:37.791 --> 08:39.309
Doesn't do anything?

08:39.498 --> 08:40.515
What do you call this?

08:49.607 --> 08:51.110
I'm glad you're
feeling good,

08:51.317 --> 08:53.867
but how do you know
it's from the tonic?

08:54.206 --> 08:56.679
Well, I looked out at
the water this morning

08:56.684 --> 09:00.538
and I felt the same terrifying
aches and pains I always do,

09:00.809 --> 09:05.082
but one sip of that magic
elixir and it all went away.

09:05.412 --> 09:08.165
Why, I might even get a
head start on my chores.

09:08.429 --> 09:10.080
What do you say, Big Macadoo?

09:10.241 --> 09:12.337
Up for a little
afternoon apple bucking?

09:13.155 --> 09:14.801
Uh, Nnope.

09:14.993 --> 09:17.233
Aw, quit yer belly aching!

09:18.122 --> 09:21.650
Gee, it looks like that
tonic works after all.

09:22.304 --> 09:23.459
I wonder what's in it.

09:23.806 --> 09:26.626
I think maybe it's
time we found out.

09:31.184 --> 09:33.752
So, you're just gonna walk
up and ask them how it works?

09:34.083 --> 09:36.704
I guess, though if
it's a genuine cure,

09:36.776 --> 09:39.367
I don't suppose they'll be too
keen on sharing the recipe.

09:45.412 --> 09:46.345
Wait a second!

09:47.338 --> 09:49.090
That's that same
pony from before!

09:52.046 --> 09:52.616
Hey!

09:59.381 --> 10:02.684
Now hold it right there, Mr...

10:03.244 --> 10:04.386
<i>Sh-sh-Shill.</i>

10:04.811 --> 10:05.843
Silver Shill.

10:07.221 --> 10:09.406
W-w-what do you two want?

10:09.859 --> 10:12.954
Our Granny took some tonic and
we want to know how it works.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.767
Granny couldn't swim
before and now she can.

10:15.994 --> 10:18.760
Just like you couldn't
walk and now you can.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.983
But what are you
doing back here?

10:21.301 --> 10:23.194
I mean, if the tonic
cured you and all?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.718
Because he's part of the act.

10:33.270 --> 10:35.689
It's time for you
to tell the truth.

10:36.044 --> 10:38.478
You never needed
crutches at all, did you?

10:38.942 --> 10:40.058
I... uh.

10:42.273 --> 10:43.075
Hey!

10:52.493 --> 10:52.999
Huh?

10:55.744 --> 10:58.158
Well, if it isn't our
most favorite Apple!

10:58.351 --> 11:00.511
What brings you back
to our humble abode?

11:03.168 --> 11:06.122
You two charlatans sold my
Granny a bottle of tonic

11:06.271 --> 11:08.321
and now she's off acting
like a filly again.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.065
What's so bad about that?

11:11.502 --> 11:13.697
If she keeps gallivanting
around like a yearling,

11:13.703 --> 11:16.013
she's apt to drop from
exhaustion or worse.

11:16.439 --> 11:19.506
What's more, I know for a
fact that your friend here

11:19.510 --> 11:21.580
is dressing up as a
different pony every night

11:21.592 --> 11:23.397
so he can pretend to be cured.

11:24.013 --> 11:26.273
Well, that's quite
an accusation.

11:26.407 --> 11:27.871
But let's say
that it's true.

11:28.550 --> 11:29.408
Hypothetically.

11:29.482 --> 11:30.388
Theoretically.

11:30.431 --> 11:33.293
As I understand, your Granny
was a famous aqua-pony...

11:33.307 --> 11:35.715
The star of the show,
once upon a time...

11:36.089 --> 11:38.807
But hasn't set so much as
a hoof in the water since.

11:39.463 --> 11:40.472
Until today.

11:40.620 --> 11:41.209
That's right.

11:41.371 --> 11:44.035
Well, then even if our tonic
were nothing more than a mixture

11:44.042 --> 11:45.605
of apple juice
and beet leaves...

11:45.611 --> 11:46.511
Hypothetically.

11:46.714 --> 11:47.785
Theoretically.

11:50.924 --> 11:52.977
The fact is that
Granny is happier now

11:52.987 --> 11:54.243
than before she tried it.

11:54.636 --> 11:55.900
I guess.

11:55.955 --> 11:57.617
So, the question is...

11:57.734 --> 11:59.486
Do you really want
to be the pony

11:59.492 --> 12:01.560
who takes all that
happiness away?

12:04.519 --> 12:05.635
I...

12:05.797 --> 12:06.905
There you are!

12:07.047 --> 12:08.407
I've been looking
all over.

12:08.540 --> 12:10.187
Did you find out
what's in the tonic?

12:14.405 --> 12:17.533
Honestly, Apple Bloom,
as long as it works,

12:17.904 --> 12:20.204
I don't suppose
it really matters.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.877
Well, if it doesn't
matter to you,

12:23.884 --> 12:25.937
then it doesn't matter
to me either, sis.

12:29.377 --> 12:30.667
That's the spirit!

12:30.956 --> 12:32.515
Come back anytime!

12:35.918 --> 12:38.384
Hey Granny, think you can
buck me over the water?

12:38.591 --> 12:40.208
I don't see why not.

12:40.476 --> 12:42.780
Come on, Big Mac,
toss her this way.

12:43.404 --> 12:44.403
Granny, wait!

12:45.164 --> 12:46.431
Whoo hoo hoo!

12:50.606 --> 12:51.658
What were you saying, dear?

12:52.454 --> 12:55.133
Granny, don't you think you
should take it kinda easy?

12:55.703 --> 12:57.994
I've been taking it
easy for too long

12:58.234 --> 13:01.194
and now, thanks to that Flim
Flam tonic, I don't have to.

13:02.154 --> 13:04.833
Granny, do you think I could
be an aqua-pony like you?

13:05.235 --> 13:07.252
Of course you can, sapling.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.383
<i>There's nothing to</i>
<i>it but to do it.</i>

13:10.288 --> 13:12.811
Well, the Ponyville
swim meet is coming up.

13:12.940 --> 13:13.960
We could enter together.

13:14.243 --> 13:16.511
<i>A legendary water</i>
<i>pony like you?</i>

13:16.768 --> 13:18.117
We'd be a cinch to win.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.500
Hmmm. I don't know.

13:21.744 --> 13:23.748
Being back in the
water is one thing,

13:23.892 --> 13:26.651
but a competition is a
pony of a different color.

13:27.693 --> 13:29.291
Oh. OK.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.522
I don't know, Granny.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.400
A swim meet sounds pretty safe.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.625
And after all, if that tonic
lets you swim in a river

13:39.631 --> 13:42.766
and a swimming hole, a pool
should be no problem at all.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.990
Well, I'll be a tart
turnover, you are right!

13:46.200 --> 13:48.466
All we need now is
more tonic!

13:53.182 --> 13:54.981
Welcome friends
and step right up!

13:55.059 --> 13:57.328
The next show starts
in five minutes.

13:57.541 --> 14:00.468
But why not buy your tonic
now and avoid the rush?

14:00.747 --> 14:02.708
Right this way,
good sir.

14:03.055 --> 14:04.585
<i>We'll take the</i>
<i>whole case!</i>

14:10.351 --> 14:12.714
Are you saying this
stuff actually works?

14:13.338 --> 14:15.553
It seems to work for Granny.

14:17.194 --> 14:19.211
You heard it here first, folks.

14:19.371 --> 14:22.745
Flim Flam Miracle Curative
Tonic is Granny Smith tested

14:22.757 --> 14:25.192
and Applejack approved!

14:26.296 --> 14:29.535
If Applejack says it works,
that's good enough for me!

14:54.060 --> 14:57.541
Hoo ha hee hee! Ha hoo ha!

14:57.974 --> 15:00.419
Just remember you two,
the most important thing

15:00.425 --> 15:03.121
is to be safe and have
fun. Right?

15:03.879 --> 15:04.616
Fiddlesticks!

15:04.751 --> 15:06.439
With the routine we've
been working on,

15:06.524 --> 15:09.572
I'll be a plum pudding if
we don't win this thing.

15:11.116 --> 15:11.722
Uh...

15:12.048 --> 15:12.919
Good luck, then.

15:13.250 --> 15:13.853
Luck?

15:15.693 --> 15:16.630
Who needs luck?

15:16.753 --> 15:18.718
We've got tonic on our side.

15:18.975 --> 15:21.467
<i>Flim Flam's Magical</i>
<i>Curative Tonic!</i>

15:22.050 --> 15:23.765
Get your Applejack
approved tonic!

15:23.996 --> 15:26.766
Granny Smith drinks
it, why shouldn't you?

15:29.947 --> 15:30.640
Right.

15:30.751 --> 15:34.655
Now if you'll excuse us,
<i>we've got some swimming to do.</i>

16:17.826 --> 16:19.529
Well, I'll be.

16:23.785 --> 16:26.501
That was some of the most
amazing aqua-batics

16:26.565 --> 16:27.356
I've ever seen.

16:27.438 --> 16:29.246
How in Equestria did you do it?

16:29.344 --> 16:31.008
Hard work? Lots of practice?

16:31.810 --> 16:34.046
Yeah, but mostly it's the tonic.

16:34.478 --> 16:37.079
That's Flim Flam's Miracle
Curative Tonic, to be precise.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.028
Buy it now, while
supplies last.

16:50.663 --> 16:52.439
What are you
doing here?

16:53.159 --> 16:56.895
Things are going so well, Flim
and Flam gave me a promotion.

16:57.496 --> 16:59.840
Just made my first
bit as a salespony.

17:00.839 --> 17:03.108
No more costumes
for this pony.

17:05.104 --> 17:07.121
This is more of
a uniform.

17:08.124 --> 17:09.533
If you say so.

17:10.025 --> 17:12.733
I used to wonder if I was
doing the right thing, you know

17:12.801 --> 17:14.087
pretending to be cured,

17:14.122 --> 17:16.614
basically lying to
folks about this tonic,

17:16.686 --> 17:18.926
but thanks to you, I realized

17:18.936 --> 17:21.853
that sometimes honesty
isn't the best policy.

17:22.329 --> 17:22.960
Thanks to...

17:23.166 --> 17:23.791
me?

17:24.474 --> 17:27.301
With Film Flam's
Magical Curative Tonic,

17:27.422 --> 17:29.219
my Granny can do anything!

17:29.400 --> 17:30.595
Just ask Applejack.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.627
No! This has gotta stop!

17:37.968 --> 17:40.866
If ponies keep believing that
tonic can do things it can't,

17:41.123 --> 17:42.581
who knows what will happen?

17:44.179 --> 17:45.596
Maybe something
like that?

17:50.487 --> 17:51.264
Granny!

17:54.099 --> 17:56.376
What in blazes does
she think she's doing?

17:56.682 --> 17:59.654
Granny's going to break the
Equestria high diving record.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.167
Land sakes!

18:27.902 --> 18:31.281
Now, what in tarnation
did you do that for?

18:32.725 --> 18:34.567
That was the most
fool-pony thing

18:34.571 --> 18:37.026
I've ever seen anypony
do in all my life.

18:39.348 --> 18:40.917
You can't do a dive like that!

18:41.375 --> 18:43.123
Aw, quit your fussin'.

18:43.293 --> 18:46.706
I had enough tonic to do
a dive ten times as high.

18:46.903 --> 18:48.600
Twenty times by
my count.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.115
Thirty with a
favorable breeze.

19:02.005 --> 19:03.720
I hate to disappoint
everypony,

19:03.933 --> 19:06.165
but there's no way Granny
could have made that dive

19:06.183 --> 19:08.524
because this
tonic is a fake.

19:10.374 --> 19:12.427
But you gave it your
stamp of approval!

19:12.667 --> 19:14.132
Are you saying you lied?

19:15.810 --> 19:17.108
I am.

19:19.297 --> 19:20.343
I didn't mean to.

19:20.569 --> 19:22.850
But everypony seemed
so much happier,

19:22.973 --> 19:24.351
<i>I couldn't bring</i>
<i>myself to tell you</i>

19:24.364 --> 19:26.210
<i>when I found out the</i>
<i>tonic wasn't real.</i>

19:28.431 --> 19:29.642
I know it was wrong.

19:29.980 --> 19:33.432
I just hope, with time, I can
win back everypony's trust.

19:35.365 --> 19:39.110
But if the tonic is a fake then
how come Granny can swim again

19:39.127 --> 19:41.982
and what about all that
aqua-batic stuff we just did?

19:42.200 --> 19:44.950
I reckon sometimes you can
forget what you're capable of

19:45.311 --> 19:47.740
and it just takes a little
extra confidence to remember

19:47.752 --> 19:49.594
that it was inside
of you all along.

19:50.948 --> 19:53.399
But telling ponies your tonic
can do things it can't

19:53.576 --> 19:54.725
is just wrong!

19:55.196 --> 19:57.504
But you just said it
boosts confidence!

19:57.605 --> 19:59.198
And that's not all it
does, folks--

19:59.264 --> 20:00.632
<i>Yes it is!</i>

20:01.713 --> 20:03.998
In fact, it's not
a tonic at all.

20:04.218 --> 20:06.230
I know because I
helped make it.

20:07.871 --> 20:10.764
Watching Applejack save Granny
and then admit to lying,

20:10.772 --> 20:14.107
well, that made me realize
I was making ponies believe

20:14.113 --> 20:16.202
in a thing that
just wasn't so.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.315
Believing in something can
help you do amazing things,

20:19.555 --> 20:21.508
but if that belief
is based on a lie,

20:22.072 --> 20:24.505
<i>eventually it's going to</i>
<i>lead to real trouble.</i>

20:25.804 --> 20:27.281
Thank you, Applejack.

20:27.990 --> 20:30.029
I got this through
dishonest means.

20:30.378 --> 20:33.281
<i>That was a mistake I</i>
<i>won't be making again.</i>

20:33.849 --> 20:35.500
I'd like you to have it.

20:36.440 --> 20:40.115
As a reminder of how you helped
me finally see the truth.

20:40.351 --> 20:41.391
I don't know.

20:41.683 --> 20:42.622
Oh, don't worry.

20:42.735 --> 20:45.767
I'll track down the pony I
sold that worthless tonic to

20:45.775 --> 20:47.900
and give them another bit
to replace this one.

20:48.316 --> 20:49.086
Honest.

20:50.179 --> 20:51.432
I'm sorry, Granny.

20:51.836 --> 20:53.744
I hope this doesn't mean
you'll stop swimming.

20:53.914 --> 20:56.035
Why in tarnation
would I do that?

20:56.401 --> 20:58.745
I just can't believe
those two salesponies

20:58.757 --> 21:00.942
had me believing
I could near fly.

21:01.990 --> 21:03.213
Hey, where'd they go?

21:05.475 --> 21:08.357
<i>Being honest sure gets hard</i>
<i>when it seems like the truth</i>

21:08.442 --> 21:10.197
<i>might hurt somepony</i>
<i>you care about.</i>

21:10.515 --> 21:13.880
<i>But I think believing a lie</i>
<i>can end up hurting even more.</i>

21:14.312 --> 21:16.407
<i>Maybe someponies don't</i>
<i>care about that...</i>

21:16.733 --> 21:18.267
<i>But I sure ain't one of them.</i>

21:18.905 --> 21:20.515
Now, you take it
easy, there, Granny.

21:20.626 --> 21:22.544
Oh, I plan to.

21:22.730 --> 21:24.376
Oh. Ha, Whee!
