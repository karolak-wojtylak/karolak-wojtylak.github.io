WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:05.530
Spring training was awesome, but
I can't wait to see my friends!

00:06.040 --> 00:08.470
I'm gonna catch up on some
Daring Do with Twilight,

00:08.610 --> 00:10.430
help Applejack make
my favorite cider,

00:10.555 --> 00:12.420
and have a sleepover
with Pinkie!

00:12.840 --> 00:15.240
We get it, you have
a fun week planned.

00:15.580 --> 00:19.635
Meanwhile I'm stuck here running
trials week at the Academy.

00:19.915 --> 00:22.250
But you love yelling and
blowing your whistle.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.530
Yeah. I do.

00:26.735 --> 00:27.915
See you gals later!

00:29.870 --> 00:30.630
Heh heh heh.

00:36.845 --> 00:39.030
Huh? Oh, the map!

00:46.735 --> 00:48.310
Hey Twilight! So
where am I going?

00:48.390 --> 00:50.605
The Crystal Mountains?
Vanhoover? Here?

00:50.820 --> 00:51.600
Please say here.

00:51.820 --> 00:54.660
Well, the good news is we
both got called by the map.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.730
Awesome! Does that
mean there's bad news?

00:58.080 --> 01:00.750
No! Well, not exactly.

01:03.125 --> 01:06.015
Aww, I was just there!

01:53.080 --> 01:54.340
Ahem.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.390
All right newbies,
welcome to trials week

01:57.430 --> 01:58.845
for the Wonderbolt Academy!

01:59.125 --> 02:02.060
You'll be judged on your
speed, strength, agility

02:02.130 --> 02:05.345
and technique, culminating
in a final evaluation.

02:05.655 --> 02:09.595
Will it be hard? Yes.
Will you cry? Maybe.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.055
Will you fly so much
your wings fall off?

02:12.870 --> 02:14.290
That has only happened once.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.950
She's just exaggerating
to make a point, right?

02:17.160 --> 02:20.890
I mean, wings can't
really fall off, can they?

02:21.440 --> 02:24.000
You think you've got what it
takes to be an elite flyer?

02:24.245 --> 02:24.995
Yes, ma'am!

02:25.185 --> 02:26.180
Yes, ma'am!

02:26.455 --> 02:28.840
Well, let me tell
you, you don't.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.185
I remember when she
said that to me.

02:34.420 --> 02:39.758
[excited hero-worship chatter]

02:40.140 --> 02:42.360
You don't think Rainbow
Dash is the pony

02:42.395 --> 02:44.145
whose wings fell
off, do you?

02:46.345 --> 02:50.855
Quit yer whisperin' and give me
five hundred laps! Go go go!

02:53.680 --> 02:55.460
Um... I just wanted you to know.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.275
You two are my favorite
ponies in all of Equestria.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.585
Well, isn't that sweet. Now
get going on those laps!

03:03.810 --> 03:05.295
Welcome, Princess
Twilight!

03:05.635 --> 03:07.365
What are you doing
back so soon?

03:07.680 --> 03:09.480
Official Friendship business.

03:09.685 --> 03:12.675
Have you noticed anypony having
a hard time with their friends?

03:14.180 --> 03:16.300
Not really. But it's
not my job to worry

03:16.315 --> 03:19.630
about their relationships. I'm
here to make them elite fliers.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.855
Adorable. They're so full
of hope and competition.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.020
Their technique could
use some work, though.

03:29.365 --> 03:30.420
You should tell them.

03:30.570 --> 03:32.795
I'm sure they'd appreciate
any notes from you.

03:33.045 --> 03:35.395
Nah. I wouldn't want to
mess with their confidence.

03:35.605 --> 03:38.085
But they'll never get better if
they don't know what to work on.

03:38.330 --> 03:40.580
Sloppy wing placement.
Crooked lines.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.110
I'm gonna have to drill
them on basic technique

03:43.140 --> 03:44.545
in the classroom portion.

03:44.835 --> 03:46.170
Classroom portion?

03:46.605 --> 03:49.805
Yeah. It's everypony's least
favorite part of trial week,

03:49.985 --> 03:51.570
but it has to be done.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.355
Maybe we can help.

03:53.665 --> 03:54.685
We can?

03:54.915 --> 03:55.870
Absolutely.

03:56.040 --> 03:59.085
Between your flying skills
and my teaching expertise,

03:59.225 --> 04:00.190
they could learn a lot!

04:00.495 --> 04:02.935
Plus, once they get to know us,
they'll be more comfortable

04:02.995 --> 04:04.765
coming to us with their
friendship problems.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.675
Count us in.

04:06.940 --> 04:07.350
Great!

04:10.990 --> 04:13.315
You have your work
cut out for you.

04:16.955 --> 04:18.890
Thank goodness I had time
to whip up a few charts

04:18.940 --> 04:20.630
on flight patterns
and wing symmetry!

04:20.875 --> 04:22.985
It's fresh in my mind from
when I learned to fly.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.265
This is so exciting!

04:26.260 --> 04:29.015
Maybe for you. I
practically fell asleep

04:29.070 --> 04:30.980
when I went through
this. Tell ya what.

04:31.245 --> 04:32.875
I'll leave the
teaching stuff to you

04:32.940 --> 04:34.665
and I'll just make
sure they stay awake.

04:37.195 --> 04:39.445
I'm pretty sure their thirst
for knowledge will keep them

04:39.485 --> 04:40.785
bright-eyed and bushy tailed.

04:41.305 --> 04:43.990
[laugh] Good
one, Twilight.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.245
Wake up, newbies!
Class is in session.

04:50.865 --> 04:52.320
Hello, students!

04:52.445 --> 04:55.225
I'm Twilight Sparkle and
this is Rainbow Dash.

04:55.495 --> 04:59.205
But you can call us T-Sparks
and the Dashinator!

04:59.425 --> 05:00.515
Ahem!

05:00.775 --> 05:03.120
Heh heh. Just kidding.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.020
And we're here to go over
basic flying technique.

05:06.265 --> 05:07.365
Uggggggh.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.585
Who said that?

05:09.630 --> 05:12.385
Me. I mean, we're here because
we're amazingly awesome

05:12.435 --> 05:16.335
crazy good flyers. We're
waaaaay past basics.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.065
What's your name?

05:18.330 --> 05:21.685
Sky Stinger. You've
never heard of me?

05:21.925 --> 05:23.470
He set the record
for the fastest

05:23.515 --> 05:24.980
vertical acceleration rate.

05:25.245 --> 05:27.590
500 feet in two seconds.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.165
That's pretty impressive.

05:30.315 --> 05:31.485
It's amazing.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.200
Ahem. It is.

05:33.235 --> 05:36.750
And we can talk personal
records after class, Ms--?

05:37.565 --> 05:41.125
Vapor Trail. She's my wingpony.
I never fly without her.

05:41.525 --> 05:43.735
But you'll have to
in the solo trials.

05:44.065 --> 05:47.010
There are solo trials?

05:47.280 --> 05:49.760
Yup. It's a part of
your final evaluation.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.800
We'll ace that test with our
wings tied behind our flanks.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.540
My picture will go
right up there...

05:56.820 --> 05:57.995
...next to yours.

05:58.680 --> 06:03.150
That's a mighty big claim
considering everypony here is an

06:03.190 --> 06:05.670
"amazingly awesome
crazy good flyer."

06:06.285 --> 06:06.855
I know.

06:07.580 --> 06:10.810
OK!
Let's get back on track.

06:11.015 --> 06:13.015
Now, who can tell me
the best wing angle

06:13.080 --> 06:15.130
to achieve minimal
air resistance?

06:21.630 --> 06:23.560
Wake up, newbies!
Class is in session.

06:31.915 --> 06:33.270
Well, there were a
few hiccups,

06:33.295 --> 06:35.075
but overall that
went pretty well.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.985
Yeah. Nopony fell asleep.

06:39.815 --> 06:41.615
What? I'm not
a student!

06:41.850 --> 06:43.105
Hey, teach!

06:43.410 --> 06:46.130
Me? Or Twilight?
Probably Twilight.

06:46.435 --> 06:49.185
Uh, both. About
the solo test,

06:49.265 --> 06:50.630
I'm actually kinda
worried about it.

06:51.155 --> 06:52.385
Aw. That's all right.

06:52.550 --> 06:54.685
We all have moments
where we doubt ourselves.

06:54.860 --> 06:58.860
No. No. I have absolutely
zero doubts about myself.

06:59.180 --> 07:03.035
I'm a strong flyer--like
really, really, really strong.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.875
But this isn't about me.
I'm worried for Vapor.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.075
Oh. Well... that is
very... kind? Of you.

07:10.755 --> 07:13.510
Tell you what. It's almost
time for freestyle training.

07:13.710 --> 07:15.815
Why don't you grab her and
show us what you've got?

07:16.160 --> 07:19.715
Yes! Prepare to be
impressed. By me.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.660
Like I said, Vapor
still needs work.

07:28.855 --> 07:31.600
Well, he may be full of
himself but I have to admit,

07:31.835 --> 07:35.775
Sky's an excellent flyer. He
must've shot up 200 feet!

07:36.015 --> 07:40.080
But did you see Vapor Trail?
Her wing was under his.

07:40.180 --> 07:42.105
I think she gave him a boost.

07:42.465 --> 07:44.370
I guess I didn't
even notice Vapor.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.330
I was too busy
watching Sky.

07:49.285 --> 07:50.780
I think you're right!

07:51.460 --> 07:53.715
Vapor just created a gust of
wind that caught Sky's wing

07:53.745 --> 07:56.655
at a 45 degree angle, propelling
him into a flipping loop.

07:57.740 --> 08:00.090
Somepony paid
attention in class!

08:00.370 --> 08:03.905
Sky obviously has no
idea he's not actually

08:03.960 --> 08:05.620
"amazingly awesome".

08:06.085 --> 08:08.140
And Vapor's so busy making
her friend look good,

08:08.270 --> 08:10.570
she's not focused on
her own flying at all.

08:11.370 --> 08:13.205
This must be our
friendship problem,

08:13.365 --> 08:15.265
and there's only
one thing to do.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.455
Fix it without telling them!
Tell them the truth!

08:22.765 --> 08:24.195
You don't want
to tell them?

08:24.420 --> 08:27.595
Of course not. Flying
is like 30 percent skill

08:27.625 --> 08:29.295
and 70 percent confidence.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.485
You can't mess with
a flier's confidence.

08:31.755 --> 08:34.140
But you can't improve if you
don't think you have to!

08:34.450 --> 08:37.180
Besides, Vapor's keeping a
pretty big secret from Sky

08:37.220 --> 08:38.620
and that can lead
to trouble.

08:38.940 --> 08:40.485
Yeah, but if we tell
them that they've been

08:40.510 --> 08:43.135
holding each other back,
that could be trouble too!

08:44.285 --> 08:45.705
I nailed that
flipping loop.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.580
I'm actually surprised
you're still here;

08:48.010 --> 08:49.385
I thought I blew
you away.

08:50.305 --> 08:53.120
You were great,
Sky.

08:54.685 --> 08:56.595
Come on, Vapor Trail.

08:56.705 --> 08:58.235
You're going to have to
build up your endurance

08:58.290 --> 08:59.985
if you want a shot
at the Academy.

09:00.265 --> 09:02.225
Wonderbolts don't
get winded.

09:03.090 --> 09:05.985
Angel Wings! You call
that cloud busting?

09:06.135 --> 09:08.010
That cloud barely
knew you were there!

09:09.215 --> 09:10.650
I love my job.

09:11.695 --> 09:13.610
We'll keep working
and who knows?

09:13.900 --> 09:17.540
One day you might come close
to being almost as good as me.

09:18.165 --> 09:19.935
Oh, I don't think so.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.910
You were voted Stratusberg's
Most Promising Flier.

09:23.305 --> 09:25.580
I was voted
Best Sneeze.

09:25.625 --> 09:26.805
Achoo!

09:27.040 --> 09:29.075
You do have a
really great sneeze.

09:29.485 --> 09:32.365
Thanks, Sky. But I don't
think I can sneeze my way

09:32.410 --> 09:36.000
into the Academy.
I'm pretty beat.

09:36.230 --> 09:37.580
I'm gonna hit the showers.

09:39.475 --> 09:41.200
You have to help her.

09:41.370 --> 09:42.890
Actually, she's
not the one...

09:43.635 --> 09:44.660
Will do!

09:47.565 --> 09:51.490
Hey, you did great. You're
a really strong flyer.

09:52.730 --> 09:53.250
Me?

09:53.685 --> 09:55.995
Vapor Trail, we know
what you've been doing.

09:56.075 --> 09:58.590
You've been doing... great!

10:00.635 --> 10:02.160
You've been helping Sky.

10:02.805 --> 10:04.425
Uh. I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:04.615 --> 10:07.525
Sky doesn't need anypony's
help. He's amazing.

10:09.935 --> 10:12.985
Not without you. And it's
gonna be pretty obvious

10:13.050 --> 10:15.265
during the solo trials when
he can't get enough air

10:15.290 --> 10:16.260
to do a flipping loop.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.825
Oh no. I can't let
that happen.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.815
I mean--aww, sugarcubes!

10:22.120 --> 10:23.730
Why are you doing
this for him?

10:24.100 --> 10:28.625
It started when we were kids.
You have to understand...

10:29.135 --> 10:32.635
...Sky grew up with a lot
of siblings. It was tough.

10:33.015 --> 10:35.395
He was always trying to
get his parents' attention.

10:36.490 --> 10:39.985
Meanwhile, I was an only child
who hated all the attention

10:40.015 --> 10:41.125
I got from mine.

10:41.355 --> 10:45.680
Vapor Trail! Where are you?
Do you need a snack?

10:45.820 --> 10:47.345
Do you want to do homework?

10:47.450 --> 10:49.430
Or we can just spend
some time together!

10:49.470 --> 10:51.405
All day is never enough!

10:53.000 --> 10:57.010
Mom! Dad! Up here! Look, look,
look, look, look, look, hey!

10:57.265 --> 10:59.320
Mom! Dad! Can you see?

11:11.330 --> 11:12.895
That was amazing!

11:20.845 --> 11:23.220
Flying together gave
us both what we wanted.

11:24.575 --> 11:27.655
But I never told Sky how
much I was helping him.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.860
It started with a
small boost here

11:30.920 --> 11:32.700
or a little gust of
wind there.

11:33.150 --> 11:36.510
But I didn't think my help could
actually hurt his chances!

11:36.870 --> 11:39.820
I understand. But now
you're both in trouble.

11:40.135 --> 11:41.775
You need to work
on your tricks.

11:41.950 --> 11:45.755
And Sky needs to be able to fly
without you or he won't make it.

11:46.110 --> 11:49.280
Oh, but he has to! Flying
with the Wonderbolts

11:49.315 --> 11:52.265
has been Sky's dream
ever since he was a colt!

11:52.555 --> 11:53.475
What about you?

11:54.295 --> 11:56.840
I-I guess I haven't
thought about it.

11:56.945 --> 11:58.785
I just want to be
with my best friend.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.445
Then we have to find a
way to help both of you.

12:01.535 --> 12:03.505
Starting with telling
Sky the truth.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.840
No! You can't. Sky
will be crushed.

12:07.035 --> 12:09.445
And without his confidence
he won't fly as well.

12:11.185 --> 12:14.320
Then I guess we'll give
Dash's method a shot.

12:14.575 --> 12:19.270
Yes! I love being right.
OK. Here's what we do.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.600
Sky needs to build his strength.
Air drills, wing lifts...

12:22.710 --> 12:24.275
all that boring,
methodical stuff.

12:24.495 --> 12:26.305
Sounds like my
cup of oats.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.535
But how will we
get him to do that?

12:28.730 --> 12:30.680
He doesn't think
he needs practice.

12:30.945 --> 12:34.080
We'll just tell Sky that he
should practice with Twilight

12:34.365 --> 12:36.405
so you won't feel so
self-conscious about getting

12:36.455 --> 12:37.990
special training from me.

12:38.170 --> 12:41.705
With you? Really?
You'd do that for me?

12:42.315 --> 12:45.910
Ha. You say that like
it's not gonna be a blast.

13:05.325 --> 13:06.130
Whoa!

13:06.170 --> 13:06.980
Agh!

13:59.520 --> 14:01.020
You were awesome!

14:01.530 --> 14:05.195
Really? Thanks! I can't
believe I was able to keep up!

14:05.465 --> 14:08.755
That's the first nice thing I've
heard you say about yourself.

14:09.345 --> 14:09.870
Hey!

14:10.185 --> 14:14.255
Can we switch now? I want to
do tricks with Rainbow Dash!

14:14.650 --> 14:17.340
You can't. I mean... uh
you're already so good

14:17.375 --> 14:18.930
at the fancy stuff.

14:19.710 --> 14:20.980
And the basic stuff.

14:22.175 --> 14:24.625
You're right. I don't
need to practice at all.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.170
Um. Maybe, Sky,
you should...

14:28.470 --> 14:31.005
I'm already the best and
everypony's gonna know it

14:31.175 --> 14:33.900
when I'm asked to join
the Academy tomorrow.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.360
But not if you
don't practice.

14:36.835 --> 14:39.555
I wouldn't be surprised if they
asked me to become a Wonderbolt

14:39.585 --> 14:43.220
straight out of the trials!
Boom. Dream achieved.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.825
SKY YOU'RE NOT AS GOOD
AS YOU THINK YOU ARE!

14:48.195 --> 14:49.260
What did you say?

14:50.365 --> 14:53.775
Sky. I want you to get
in as much as anypony,

14:53.925 --> 14:55.905
and you're amazing, but...

14:57.220 --> 14:58.025
But what?

14:58.520 --> 15:01.090
I've been... helping you.

15:01.490 --> 15:05.000
Please. I don't need
your help. Watch.

15:18.140 --> 15:20.715
How could you do this
to me? Did you all know?

15:23.395 --> 15:26.440
Oh great. So everypony
but me knows I'm a joke.

15:26.630 --> 15:29.550
Was this your plan the whole
time? To embarrass me?

15:30.065 --> 15:32.910
What? No! Don't
you know me at all?

15:33.240 --> 15:35.335
I guess not since it took
me this long to find out

15:35.355 --> 15:36.750
you're a terrible wingpony!

15:37.455 --> 15:39.190
I can't believe you!

15:39.450 --> 15:41.545
I can't believe I
was ever your friend!

15:43.400 --> 15:44.460
Thanks a lot.

15:53.230 --> 15:54.640
Do you think
they're still mad?

15:59.210 --> 16:00.610
Yeah, they're still mad.

16:00.875 --> 16:03.710
This is all my fault. If we
had just done things your way,

16:03.745 --> 16:05.895
maybe we could've
avoided this whole mess.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.960
No, it's my fault.

16:08.185 --> 16:10.715
It hit me when I was
watching Sky train with you.

16:10.860 --> 16:12.290
He wasn't even trying.

16:23.585 --> 16:26.145
Oh no. He's lost
his confidence.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.500
Do you want to tell me why one
of my most promising students

16:29.580 --> 16:32.050
is flying like a balloon
with a hole in it?

16:32.460 --> 16:35.545
Uh, it's a long story,
but we'll fix it.

16:35.830 --> 16:37.010
Yes you will!

16:38.750 --> 16:41.680
We really messed up, huh?

16:42.375 --> 16:43.540
I have a plan.

16:49.525 --> 16:52.420
Hey, Sky. I thought I
might find you here.

16:52.790 --> 16:55.735
Well, apparently I
need a lot of practice.

16:56.170 --> 16:58.110
Guess I'm not the
natural I thought I was.

16:58.370 --> 17:00.030
No, you're not.

17:00.705 --> 17:02.230
Thanks. Good pep talk.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.130
I wasn't a natural
at friendship.

17:04.305 --> 17:06.640
But with some practice and
some help from my friends,

17:06.680 --> 17:10.125
I got better. And now? I'm
the Princess of Friendship.

17:10.690 --> 17:13.965
So you're saying I can be
the Princess of Flying?

17:17.755 --> 17:21.690
You know, you're really good.
You're lead pony material.

17:22.765 --> 17:24.095
That's sweet of you, but no.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.065
I couldn't handle
all the attention.

17:26.285 --> 17:28.205
But you'll never
become a Wonderbolt

17:28.235 --> 17:32.330
if you're too afraid to shine.
That is what you want, right?

17:33.055 --> 17:36.105
Not at first. I just
wanted to be with Sky.

17:36.540 --> 17:38.850
But learning to do all
those fun tricks with you?

17:39.115 --> 17:41.945
It made me realize this is
something I want for myself.

17:42.150 --> 17:45.050
I was hoping you'd say
that. Come with me.

17:51.630 --> 17:52.965
What's she doing here?

17:53.220 --> 17:56.890
Sky, Vapor was never trying
to steal your spotlight.

17:57.225 --> 17:58.835
She thought she
was helping you.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.740
And Vapor, you shouldn't
have been so content

18:01.765 --> 18:03.045
to take a back seat.

18:03.780 --> 18:07.855
Now you can either stay
mad, or help each other

18:07.885 --> 18:10.185
and become two of
the greatest fliers

18:10.210 --> 18:12.685
the Wonderbolt
Academy has ever seen!

18:13.775 --> 18:15.035
Please pick the second option.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.885
I don't want Spitfire
to be mad at me.

18:30.245 --> 18:31.740
You've got this, Sky!

18:44.115 --> 18:45.630
Focus on a cloud
when you spin!

18:45.745 --> 18:47.515
It'll help you fly straight
when you come out of it.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.455
Uh-huh!

19:11.820 --> 19:13.285
Woo-hoo!

19:25.285 --> 19:28.310
Woo! Yeah! Ha ha ha!

19:42.350 --> 19:46.245
Oh yeah, way to go! Woo-hoo!

20:00.175 --> 20:01.395
Congratulations.

20:01.740 --> 20:04.560
You've both made it into
the Wonderbolt Academy.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.675
Whatever you
did, it worked.

20:09.870 --> 20:11.345
These two have a
lot of potential.

20:11.850 --> 20:15.110
Who knows? They might even
be better than you, Crash.

20:15.855 --> 20:19.890
OK,
let's not get carried away.

20:20.430 --> 20:22.585
Um, I just wanted
you to know.

20:22.735 --> 20:26.415
You two are my new favorite
ponies in all of Equestria.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.405
Hey! I heard that!

20:31.130 --> 20:33.150
I can't believe
we did it!

20:33.380 --> 20:36.085
You were great! Even
though you can out-fly me,

20:36.195 --> 20:38.090
you can be my
wingpony anytime.

20:38.390 --> 20:40.900
And you can be mine.

20:59.770 --> 21:02.105
Phew! It's good to be home.

21:03.355 --> 21:07.055
You're telling me. Now
we can finally catch up

21:07.100 --> 21:10.380
on some Daring Do; I can
make cider with Applejack...

21:14.645 --> 21:16.990
Dash! I've been looking
all over for you.

21:17.035 --> 21:20.070
Wonderbolt emergency!
We gotta get back to HQ!

21:20.300 --> 21:26.255
You've got to be kidding
me! I was JUST there!
