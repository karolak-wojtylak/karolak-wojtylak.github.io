00:02.070 --> 00:04.330
Oh ho! But
that's not all!

00:04.330 --> 00:08.700
When I went to look for them
again, they were on the ceiling!

00:08.700 --> 00:13.000
Oh, Discord, I've never known
anypony as funny as you.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.320
I love that story about the
time you tried to train your right paw...

00:16.820 --> 00:19.000
...to fetch your left leg!

00:20.200 --> 00:23.080
Oh, I do love our Tuesday Teas.

00:23.090 --> 00:26.120
And I can't wait for you to
meet my friend, Tree Hugger.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.050
She's going to love you, too.

00:28.620 --> 00:32.600
Tree Hugger? Ah ha ha!

00:32.600 --> 00:35.020
I met her on a trip
to see the Breezies.

00:35.020 --> 00:40.070
She's a member of the Equestrian Society
for the Preservation of Rare Creatures.

00:40.070 --> 00:41.800
How nice for you.

00:42.720 --> 00:46.770
We're all going to have so much fun
together at the Grand Galloping Gala!

00:46.900 --> 00:50.570
Oh! I was wondering when
you were going to ask me!

00:50.570 --> 00:52.520
I'd love to!

00:52.520 --> 00:54.570
Oh! Oh no.

00:54.570 --> 00:58.470
Um. I'm afraid I've already
asked Tree Hugger.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.450
I'm sorry, Discord.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.270
I assumed you'd have your own ticket since
you and Princess Celestia are friends now.

01:06.570 --> 01:08.030
Were you not invited?

01:08.370 --> 01:12.620
Who, me? It probably got
lost in the mail.

01:12.620 --> 01:17.950
No BIGGIE, as the foals say.
Well, gotta go!

01:18.300 --> 01:20.820
But we haven't had any
of our Tuesday Tea cakes.

01:21.720 --> 01:25.950
Well, I guess we're just goingto have to
EXCLUDE them from our party this time!

01:25.950 --> 01:27.920
Oh! Oh, did I say that out lou--

01:27.920 --> 01:29.450
I mean, ta ta.

01:37.720 --> 01:43.220
Regular Subtitles by YayPonies
We have Muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

02:15.320 --> 02:16.650
Gah, aah!

02:16.650 --> 02:17.950
Where's Twilight?

02:18.050 --> 02:21.170
Uh, she's in Canterlot, helping
Princess Celestia with the Gala.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.970
Oh, your first
Grand Galloping Gala!

02:30.350 --> 02:32.200
The excitement,
the anticipation!

02:32.200 --> 02:35.350
I wouldn't miss this for
all the jewels in Equestria!

02:36.150 --> 02:40.020
We're going to the Gala!
We're going to the Gala!

02:40.020 --> 02:42.050
We're going to the Gala!

02:42.050 --> 02:44.300
All right y'all, keep it down.

02:44.450 --> 02:48.800
It ain't like it's a life
changing experience or nothin'--

02:51.620 --> 02:55.220
My little sister's
all grown up!

02:56.770 --> 02:57.770
Hey!

03:00.420 --> 03:03.000
This is going to be
the best night ever!

03:03.620 --> 03:05.670
Aaaah!

03:06.670 --> 03:11.600
I don't suppose that uh, these adorable
little cutie pies have their own tickets

03:11.600 --> 03:14.500
to the Gross Gruesome
Gala, do they?

03:16.820 --> 03:19.300
To answer your
rather rude question,

03:19.300 --> 03:21.050
they're going as
our dates.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.670
Our plus ones!

03:22.920 --> 03:26.450
We're plus ones!

03:26.550 --> 03:28.200
We're plus ones!

03:28.200 --> 03:29.600
Yes, yes, yes.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.300
I believe I got that!

03:32.370 --> 03:33.220
Yeah!

03:35.250 --> 03:37.500
Have a wonderful,
special, fantastic day!

03:37.770 --> 03:39.350
Oh, hi Discord!
Want some cake?

03:40.570 --> 03:42.450
I can give you a list of all
of the flavors we have

03:42.450 --> 03:43.500
in order of most delicious

03:43.520 --> 03:46.120
to incredibly,
unbelievably delicious!

03:46.120 --> 03:49.570
Actually, Pinkie Pie, who
are you taking to...

03:49.850 --> 03:50.950
I mean, do you...

03:51.900 --> 03:54.670
Oh, you know what?
I AM famished!

03:54.670 --> 03:56.300
I'll take all the cakes!

03:56.470 --> 04:00.870
ALL OF THEM? HE WANTS
ALL OF THE CAKES!

04:01.100 --> 04:03.820
Well, I'll need all my energy
when I'm dancing at the Gala...

04:03.820 --> 04:05.570
IF I decide to go, that is.

04:05.650 --> 04:09.300
Oh, by the way, are
you bringing anypony?

04:09.570 --> 04:10.850
Oh, of course!

04:10.850 --> 04:14.150
I WAS going to ask my mom
because she's, you know, MY MOM,

04:14.150 --> 04:15.450
but it turned out she
didn't want to go,

04:15.450 --> 04:17.620
so I started asking around and
around and around

04:17.620 --> 04:20.320
and I couldn't think of anypony and
I was about to just go by myself

04:20.320 --> 04:21.800
but then I realized OF COURSE!

04:21.950 --> 04:24.820
Who loves fancy, exciting
affairs more than anypony else?

04:25.020 --> 04:26.470
My sister MAUD!

04:26.750 --> 04:27.300
You know what?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.120
Cancel my order!

04:31.170 --> 04:33.750
You want NONE of
the cakes now?

04:34.750 --> 04:38.420
Oh my, you are funny.

04:38.420 --> 04:42.480
I guess every being in
Equestria is funny today.

04:43.220 --> 04:44.650
Oh, how rude of me.

04:44.820 --> 04:46.520
Tree Hugger, this
is Discord.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.220
Discord, Tree Hugger.

04:48.420 --> 04:50.850
Radical to meet you.

04:50.850 --> 04:53.020
Really digging your vibe.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.600
My vibe?

04:56.170 --> 04:57.490
It's a compliment.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.300
Oh well, I'm
sure it is!

05:00.300 --> 05:01.920
Well, I must be off!

05:03.250 --> 05:05.950
It has nothing to do with
seeing you or not seeing you,

05:05.950 --> 05:07.750
you can rest
assured of that!

05:09.570 --> 05:12.600
Have fun at the Gala!

05:14.850 --> 05:16.520
Righteous.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.850
Oh, Tree Hugger, you're
such a great friend!

05:25.970 --> 05:29.870
So much funnier than
unfunny old Discord!

05:34.150 --> 05:37.050
No no, here, take my plus one!

05:37.300 --> 05:38.700
I insist!

05:39.070 --> 05:41.670
Before somepony else
thinks he's my friend

05:41.670 --> 05:44.250
and expects to be
asked instead!

05:44.670 --> 05:45.850
What's that?

05:45.850 --> 05:48.870
You're worried Discord
might be upset?

05:48.870 --> 05:50.620
Not a problem!

05:50.620 --> 05:54.020
I can make more new
friends any time I want!

05:54.200 --> 05:58.370
It's not as if any of
this actually mattered!

05:58.520 --> 06:01.220
I don't even want to
go to the Gala anyway!

06:06.070 --> 06:08.870
Are you perhaps looking for ME?

06:09.070 --> 06:09.670
Are you...

06:10.570 --> 06:12.120
..."Discord or
current resident?"

06:12.500 --> 06:14.850
I can't find any street
numbers in this place.

06:17.650 --> 06:20.370
My ticket to the
Grand Galloping Gala!

06:20.520 --> 06:22.820
I WAS invited after all!

06:26.120 --> 06:28.220
Why is this so late?

06:28.550 --> 06:33.100
Well, I got a little lost after
I escaped the flying badgers.

06:33.470 --> 06:36.270
Can you point me in the
direction of the bottomless pit?

06:36.570 --> 06:38.870
I think I can make my
way back from there.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.520
Oh, over there somewhere.

06:40.520 --> 06:41.730
Just, just go over there.

06:42.470 --> 06:46.200
Looks like I'll see you at the
Gala after all, Fluttershy.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.800
But I can't show up alone.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.000
She'll think that
she's my only friend!

06:50.270 --> 06:52.870
Who could I bring on
such short notice?

07:02.870 --> 07:06.300
I must say, it's been very nice
having you take over some of the

07:06.300 --> 07:08.800
planning responsibilities
for this year's Gala.

07:08.870 --> 07:11.370
Anything I can do to
make it easier on you.

07:11.370 --> 07:12.600
Thank you, Twilight.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.670
I am quite looking forward to
just enjoying the Gala for once.

07:18.820 --> 07:23.200
Announcing, the spirit of
chaos, Discord, and his guest,

07:23.550 --> 07:24.600
the...uh...

07:26.700 --> 07:28.170
...the Smooze!

07:36.070 --> 07:38.300
Good evening, everypony!

07:38.300 --> 07:40.370
What a glorious affair!

07:42.570 --> 07:46.300
He does have a yen for
shiny things, the rascal!

07:50.720 --> 07:52.100
I'll take care of this.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.820
What are you doing
here with...that?

07:58.120 --> 07:59.070
Now, now, now!

07:59.120 --> 08:02.770
The Smooze may be an "it" but
it's an "it" with a heart of,

08:02.950 --> 08:04.650
well, blob.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.380
This night is extremely
important to me, Discord.

08:11.470 --> 08:13.770
Keep it under control.

08:14.350 --> 08:15.670
Yes yes yes, of course.

08:15.970 --> 08:19.700
Tell me, have you seen
Fluttershy anywhere?

08:20.870 --> 08:25.200
We're here! We're here!
We made it to the Gala!

08:30.500 --> 08:31.120
Really?

08:32.920 --> 08:37.800
...the aura coming off the
waterfall was so alive!

08:37.800 --> 08:41.750
So like, magic in
manifestation...

08:42.100 --> 08:42.800
Wow.

08:43.220 --> 08:45.400
Oh, Fluttershy!

08:45.470 --> 08:47.620
I didn't see YOU there!

08:48.200 --> 08:51.700
How did you even know to look
for an aura on a waterfall?

08:59.450 --> 09:00.420
Discord!

09:00.520 --> 09:02.150
I thought you weren't coming!

09:02.420 --> 09:04.420
No, I actually
never said that.

09:04.550 --> 09:06.400
But funny how you
remembered it that way.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.370
Anyway, good to see
you...Tree... Friend, is it?

09:10.370 --> 09:14.100
Your name is slipping my
mind right now. How strange.

09:14.100 --> 09:17.470
Nice to meet you;
I'm Tree Hugger.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.420
Blessings.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.470
You have met me
before, actually.

09:22.820 --> 09:24.350
Cool.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.850
Like in another
life, maybe?

09:27.270 --> 09:30.350
You've got to be kidding!
You don't remember me?

09:32.700 --> 09:36.550
Ha ha. I meet a LOT of
different creatures.

09:36.950 --> 09:40.000
Each one of them
perfect and unique.

09:40.350 --> 09:43.920
Yes, well, as I was saying,
it's just great to be here

09:43.920 --> 09:48.200
with my oldest, bestest friend.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.370
Am I really your
oldest, bestest friend?

09:51.670 --> 09:52.550
YOU?

09:52.650 --> 09:54.720
Of course not!

09:54.920 --> 09:56.970
You think I don't
have other friends?

09:56.970 --> 09:59.120
I'm CENTURIES old!

09:59.120 --> 10:01.320
I was talking about the Smooze!

10:01.320 --> 10:03.120
Smoozeface, the Smoozenator.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.450
Well I mean, that's what we
called him back in college.

10:05.950 --> 10:09.450
Smooze, I would like you to
meet Fluttershy and um,

10:11.300 --> 10:14.120
Tree... what is
it...oh, Tree Embrace?

10:14.920 --> 10:17.120
Oh, I like that.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.720
It's so in rhythm
with my life force.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.050
Maybe I'll change it!

10:24.250 --> 10:27.250
I can't believe I've never heard
you speak of the Smooze before.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.820
It sounds like you
two are so close.

10:30.220 --> 10:33.670
Well, I'm glad you got that,
because that's what is true.

10:34.900 --> 10:38.020
We ARE very close.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.550
That's wonderful!

10:39.720 --> 10:41.850
The four of us should go
out to dinner sometime!

10:44.470 --> 10:47.070
We should all go out
to dinner sometime?

10:47.200 --> 10:48.370
Have you no heart?

10:50.350 --> 10:53.670
Oh, oh. It looks like
somepony wants to mingle!

10:53.800 --> 10:55.770
We'll be back in a bit.

10:56.020 --> 10:56.850
Oh, Okay.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.470
Treezy and I would love
to talk to you more later.

10:59.470 --> 11:00.420
TREEZY?

11:00.720 --> 11:01.450
Really?

11:01.520 --> 11:04.200
Sort of a juvenile
nickname, don't you think?

11:05.050 --> 11:06.400
Smoozie!

11:06.570 --> 11:07.820
Wait up!

11:11.650 --> 11:14.570
Now listen, Smooze, I need
to make this a party of one

11:14.570 --> 11:15.720
for a little while.

11:15.950 --> 11:18.500
Just stay out here
until I come for you.

11:26.650 --> 11:32.700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

11:32.720 --> 11:34.150
What's so funny?

11:34.350 --> 11:35.650
Exactly!

11:36.220 --> 11:39.370
Uh...I think we're gonna
go hit the dance floor.

11:39.570 --> 11:43.020
Fluttershy, tell the Hugs here
about the time that we went to

11:43.020 --> 11:46.150
the store and came back with
TWO cakes instead of one

11:46.150 --> 11:49.620
because that's how crazy we
are when we're together!

11:50.520 --> 11:53.550
Um, we went to the
store and got two cakes.

11:55.420 --> 11:58.850
Oh. Well, you kind of
left out all the fun and frivolity there,

11:58.850 --> 12:01.320
but I'm sure you
got it, Tree Hugger.

12:01.650 --> 12:04.120
I got that you
really like cake.

12:04.570 --> 12:07.950
We like each other.
THAT was the point!

12:08.700 --> 12:10.650
I'm actually pretty
lukewarm about cake.

12:12.450 --> 12:14.050
Let me in!

12:20.100 --> 12:21.920
That creature took my jewels!

12:27.170 --> 12:27.820
Discord!

12:28.200 --> 12:31.250
I thought I told you to keep
your friend under control!

12:31.550 --> 12:33.750
Oh please, I have
better things to do

12:33.770 --> 12:35.720
than to watch that
THING all night.

12:38.350 --> 12:43.300
What I mean to say is, that
thing is a dear, dear friend

12:43.300 --> 12:45.220
and I'll make sure
that the ooze

12:45.220 --> 12:48.970
that he can't help but secrete
doesn't get on anypony else.

12:56.550 --> 12:57.420
Thank you.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.520
It's all right, everypony!

12:59.520 --> 13:02.770
Let's just get back to
enjoying this magical evening!

13:04.850 --> 13:08.150
You are making me look like a
fool in front of Fluttershy!

13:09.100 --> 13:10.900
I'll be back when
the Gala is over.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.620
Oh, Tree Hugger!

13:27.620 --> 13:30.650
I've never known
anypony as funny as you!

13:37.150 --> 13:38.100
Check, check, check.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.170
Is this thing on?

13:39.700 --> 13:43.100
Good evening,
fillies and germs.

13:43.270 --> 13:44.920
I just flew into Canterlot

13:44.920 --> 13:48.750
and wow are my
inter-species parts tired!

13:54.100 --> 13:57.070
I've only got these tiny
mismatched wings

13:57.070 --> 14:01.200
and even I can fly better than
Twilight Sparkle, am I right?

14:02.800 --> 14:03.420
Hey!

14:06.200 --> 14:08.920
Well, perhaps you're into
more observational humor.

14:09.920 --> 14:13.100
Did you ever notice how
you always materialize

14:13.100 --> 14:14.300
out of thin air?

14:14.620 --> 14:17.020
Why not thick air?

14:17.200 --> 14:19.250
What's the deal there?

14:22.170 --> 14:23.500
Tough crowd.

14:24.270 --> 14:25.500
What is he doing?

14:25.800 --> 14:28.370
I think they're... jokes?

14:29.120 --> 14:30.920
Maud! Jokes!

14:31.220 --> 14:32.200
My favorite.

14:37.000 --> 14:37.870
Knock knock!

14:41.070 --> 14:43.770
You're supposed to
say "who's there!"

14:44.100 --> 14:46.520
This is the most basic
of jokes!

14:49.070 --> 14:51.100
You're the most basic of jokes.

14:51.570 --> 14:53.350
Good one, Maud!

15:10.120 --> 15:11.970
What is that?

15:32.950 --> 15:35.170
None of my magic
works on this ooze!

15:35.400 --> 15:36.450
Can you stop it?

15:40.670 --> 15:41.950
I'm afraid not!

15:42.150 --> 15:44.320
Discord, how could
you bring him here?

15:44.570 --> 15:46.620
Oh, he's not that bad.

15:47.050 --> 15:49.700
Oh! My shoes will be
ruined forever!

15:50.020 --> 15:52.400
That's what you're
worried about? Really?

15:54.170 --> 15:56.370
This is kind of
a bummer.

15:56.620 --> 15:57.600
Isn't it, though?

15:57.600 --> 15:59.700
And to think, it never
would have happened

15:59.700 --> 16:03.570
had I come to the Gala as
somepony else's plus one.

16:04.050 --> 16:07.670
Seems like something might
have harshed his flow, ya know?

16:07.870 --> 16:10.870
Like his senses are agitated.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.550
You don't know anything
about rare creatures.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.770
I've known
Smoozeface for ages!

16:15.900 --> 16:19.170
He's not agitated;
he's partying down!

16:20.250 --> 16:24.070
All he needs is some, like,
calming auditory therapy.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.920
I know I always feel
really at peace

16:28.020 --> 16:31.370
when I'm being bathed
in positive vibes.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.550
Maybe he'll calm down
with some sonic bliss.

16:34.700 --> 16:37.450
Do you even KNOW
what you just said?

16:38.500 --> 16:42.670
<i>Ommmm! Eeeeeeee.</i>

16:42.670 --> 16:47.700
<i>Ommmmm. Eeeeeee.</i>

16:53.800 --> 16:57.900
Let go, Smooze. Bliss out.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.700
<i>Eeeeee!</i>

16:59.700 --> 17:03.500
<i>Ommmm.</i>

17:04.070 --> 17:08.700
<i>Ommmm! Eeeeeeee.</i>

17:10.070 --> 17:11.120
It worked!

17:13.020 --> 17:14.800
Way to go, Tree Hugger!

17:15.150 --> 17:18.800
That was the most magical thing
I've ever seen done with animals!

17:21.020 --> 17:23.100
Oh thanks, everypony.

17:23.450 --> 17:26.950
It makes perfect karmic sense
your magic doesn't work on him.

17:27.250 --> 17:32.050
He only responds to vibrations
that peace out his energy fields.

17:32.050 --> 17:32.800
Stop it!

17:33.000 --> 17:33.870
Stop it!

17:33.870 --> 17:34.720
That's it!

17:34.800 --> 17:36.850
I am done with you, Tree Hugger!

17:37.170 --> 17:38.320
Oh, man.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.420
You're really bummin' me out.

17:41.150 --> 17:44.000
Can you just like, lower
your voice a skosh?

17:44.320 --> 17:45.220
A skosh?

17:45.320 --> 17:46.700
A SKOSH?

17:53.850 --> 17:58.170
Whoa, dude. What is THAT?

17:59.450 --> 18:01.770
Relax, I'm not
going to hurt you.

18:01.770 --> 18:04.320
I'm simply going to send
you to another dimension.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.470
I can't have you interfering

18:06.570 --> 18:09.650
in my relationship with
Fluttershy anymore.

18:09.920 --> 18:10.720
Discord?

18:10.850 --> 18:11.750
Stop!

18:11.920 --> 18:12.900
I will!

18:13.020 --> 18:15.100
Just as soon as she's gone!

18:15.250 --> 18:18.170
Then we can have a good laugh
about this whole affair

18:18.300 --> 18:20.620
over our regular Tuesday Tea!

18:21.200 --> 18:23.870
Don't worry, Fluttershy,
we'll stop him!

18:32.500 --> 18:35.270
I'm doing her a
favor, Fluttershy!

18:35.320 --> 18:36.850
It's a lovely dimension!

18:36.850 --> 18:39.850
White sand beaches, an
attentive waitstaff.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.720
I mean, Okay, the
humidity isn't great,

18:42.720 --> 18:45.000
but where isn't that
the case these days?

18:45.370 --> 18:47.650
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

18:47.850 --> 18:50.100
We were all getting
along so well!

18:50.320 --> 18:52.350
As well as we could,

18:52.600 --> 18:55.670
considering you've already
stomped all over our friendship

18:55.670 --> 18:59.920
by inviting her to the
biggest night of the year

19:00.170 --> 19:03.000
as if I didn't matter at all!

19:03.150 --> 19:05.270
Did you really think
I'd abandon you

19:05.270 --> 19:07.320
just because I
have a new friend?

19:07.420 --> 19:08.050
Yes!

19:08.150 --> 19:09.670
Because that's
what you did!

19:09.670 --> 19:10.820
No, Discord.

19:11.050 --> 19:13.120
I invited a friend
to a party.

19:13.370 --> 19:15.120
I didn't abandon you.

19:15.120 --> 19:18.950
What if you had a friend that you could
discuss chaos-based magic with?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.400
Would that mean we
weren't friends anymore?

19:23.750 --> 19:25.300
No, I suppose not.

19:25.470 --> 19:27.850
It would just mean that
I'd have different friends

19:27.850 --> 19:29.950
for different things. Oh!

19:30.520 --> 19:31.120
Oh dear.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.120
It looks like I've perhaps
overreacted just a skosh.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.750
More like a lot of skoshes.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.600
Tree Hugger, could
you give us a minute?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.300
I'm just so new at this
whole friendship thing!

19:43.720 --> 19:45.750
It's so much more
complicated than it looks.

19:46.170 --> 19:49.400
Do you think maybe you
owe somepony an apology?

19:51.400 --> 19:52.620
Not ME!

19:53.670 --> 19:54.500
Oh, oh.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.520
Ahem, Yes, right.

20:04.670 --> 20:08.970
Tree Hugger, I'm sorry that you
got caught in the middle of my,

20:09.050 --> 20:10.520
you know, wrath.

20:11.350 --> 20:13.500
Oh, it's all groovy.

20:14.650 --> 20:18.950
Um, I need like a few minutes
to clear out my chakras

20:19.150 --> 20:22.220
before I can hug you from a
place of authenticity.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.620
Oh, your chakras, yes.

20:24.750 --> 20:25.370
Fair enough.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.170
I owe you an apology, Smooze.

20:29.470 --> 20:32.450
I spent the whole evening
thinking about my own feelings

20:32.650 --> 20:34.500
and never thinking about yours.

20:36.775 --> 20:37.950
Well, friends!

20:37.950 --> 20:44.675
I think I may actually grow to
like this multiple friend thing!

20:45.100 --> 20:46.100
I like it too.

20:46.425 --> 20:49.750
Hey, it's not a party until
somepony spreads magic-resistant

20:49.750 --> 20:52.075
ooze uncontrollably
over the ballroom!

20:52.550 --> 20:55.950
Come on, Smoozinator,
let's dance!

20:59.250 --> 21:01.225
I'm sorry,
Princess Celestia.

21:01.425 --> 21:03.600
I thought I could give
you a break tonight,

21:03.775 --> 21:05.875
but it turns out I
was in over my head.

21:06.325 --> 21:08.750
You have nothing
to apologize for.

21:09.050 --> 21:12.350
This has been the most
fun Gala in years!

21:12.600 --> 21:14.625
I know, it
was a-- WHAT?

21:14.875 --> 21:16.925
But there was ooze
all over the place...

21:17.050 --> 21:20.350
and one of the guests threatened to
send somepony to another dimension.

21:20.550 --> 21:21.400
I know!

21:21.700 --> 21:25.975
Can you imagine how dull it would
have been if I hadn't invited Discord?

21:26.400 --> 21:27.375
Come on!

21:28.150 --> 21:30.450
The night is still young!
