00:02.780 --> 00:07.280
I want to start our field trip here,
in the world famous Canterlot Sculpture Garden.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.260
That one over there
represents friendship.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.320
All right, my little ponies!

00:15.320 --> 00:17.440
This one represents victory.

00:17.440 --> 00:20.110
How cool would it be to have
*that* for a cutie mark!

00:20.110 --> 00:21.660
Cool!

00:21.970 --> 00:25.120
If you were actually
victoryful at somethin'.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.850
That's not a word!

00:27.080 --> 00:28.900
What are you? A dictionary?

00:28.930 --> 00:29.980
Girls!

00:30.190 --> 00:33.620
Now this is a really interesting statue.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.940
What do you notice about it?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.720
It's got an eagle claw!

00:37.720 --> 00:40.410
-And a lion paw!
-And a snake tail!

00:40.640 --> 00:43.190
This creature is called a draconequus.

00:43.190 --> 00:46.930
He is the head of a pony and a body
made up of all sorts of things.

00:46.930 --> 00:49.030
What do you suppose that represents?

00:49.340 --> 00:52.200
-Confusion!
-Evil!
-Chaos!

00:52.200 --> 00:54.380
It's not chaos, you dodo!

00:54.380 --> 00:56.890
Don't call me things
I don't know the meaning of!

00:56.890 --> 00:58.780
And it is too chaos!

00:58.780 --> 00:59.640
Is not!

00:59.700 --> 01:01.230
You're both wrong!

01:10.060 --> 01:12.440
Actually, in a way you're all right.

01:13.410 --> 01:15.490
This statue represents discord...

01:15.490 --> 01:18.410
...which means a lack of
harmony between ponies.

01:18.410 --> 01:21.890
In fact, you three have
demonstrated discord so well...

01:21.900 --> 01:25.350
...that you're each going to
write me an essay explaining it.

01:27.230 --> 01:30.130
Now let's go. And I don't
want any more fighting.

01:30.230 --> 01:33.490
-It's confusion!
-Evil!
-Chaos!

02:18.620 --> 02:19.990
Come back here, you!

02:22.420 --> 02:23.240
Gotcha!

02:23.500 --> 02:25.710
Eeew! What is this?

02:28.640 --> 02:30.430
Cotton candy?

02:37.160 --> 02:40.040
Wait a second! It's not supposed
to rain until tomorrow!

02:40.040 --> 02:41.570
You can't just...!

02:43.050 --> 02:44.190
You did.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.950
Hey! I didn't tell you to go anywhere!

02:50.450 --> 02:53.090
Rainbow Dash! What's
going on with that rain?

02:53.090 --> 02:54.330
I mean... chocolate milk?

02:54.330 --> 02:56.290
I mean... chocolate milk rain?!

02:56.400 --> 02:58.900
There's crazy weather
all over Equestria!

02:58.900 --> 03:01.690
Cloudsdale's getting soaked
by a major cola storm right now.

03:01.930 --> 03:05.420
But don't worry. I'm not leaving you,
till I get control of Ponyville.

03:08.590 --> 03:10.590
Why would you wanna stop *this*?

03:14.140 --> 03:17.300
I heard about your troubles, Applejack,
and I came to see if there's anything I could do.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.330
Without getting wet. Or dirty.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.210
Or out from under my umbrella.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.180
Fluttershy! Do somethin'!

03:31.190 --> 03:33.540
Now Angel, you really shouldn't...

03:34.070 --> 03:35.900
No! It's not possible!

03:36.600 --> 03:38.130
I must be seeing things!

03:39.840 --> 03:43.970
Don't worry, everyone! I've learned
a new spell that'll fix everything.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.440
My fail-safe spell...

03:58.740 --> 04:00.950
...failed! What do we do?

04:00.950 --> 04:02.160
Uh... Give up?

04:02.420 --> 04:05.320
Spike. Twilight will come up with something.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.420
Time for Plan B.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.910
Rainbow! Can you corral all those
clouds in one corner of the sky?

04:18.920 --> 04:22.750
Applejack! I need you to bring those
high strong storm clouds down to earth.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.840
Hey! What happened?

04:36.730 --> 04:40.100
Oh dear! I hope that none
of the animals see these...

04:40.100 --> 04:43.020
...delicious chocolate-filled
cotton candy clouds.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.280
I'd hate to have to share them.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.360
You and me both, sister!

04:49.440 --> 04:50.570
Hey!

04:52.180 --> 04:56.120
And when y'all are done that, feel free
to have some popcorn for dessert.

04:56.350 --> 04:58.810
You see, Spike? You
should never give up.

04:58.820 --> 05:02.360
There's nothing we can't
overcome if we all work together.

05:07.660 --> 05:11.990
Come on, girls! Princess Celestia wants
to see us all in Canterlot immediately!

05:20.930 --> 05:23.690
Princess Celestia! We came
as fast as we could.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.130
Thank you, Twilight. Thank you all.

05:27.130 --> 05:29.370
Is this about the weather?
And the animals' weird behavior?

05:29.370 --> 05:32.510
What's happening out there? Why
isn't my magic working? Is there...?

05:33.110 --> 05:34.320
Follow me.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.370
I've called you here
for a matter of great importance.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.630
It seems an old foe of mine...

05:39.630 --> 05:42.910
...someone I thought I had
defeated long ago, has returned.

05:43.250 --> 05:46.100
His name is Discord.

05:47.270 --> 05:50.310
Discord is the mischievous
spirit of disharmony.

05:50.310 --> 05:52.490
Before my sister and I
stood up to him...

05:52.490 --> 05:56.650
...he ruled Equestria in an eternal state
of unrest and unhappiness.

05:56.650 --> 05:59.960
Luna and I saw how miserable
life was for earth ponies...

05:59.960 --> 06:02.020
...pegasi and unicorns alike.

06:02.020 --> 06:04.490
So after discovering
the Elements of Harmony...

06:04.500 --> 06:07.780
...we combined our powers
and rose up against him...

06:07.780 --> 06:09.470
...turning him to stone.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.300
Alright, Princess!

06:11.310 --> 06:14.140
I thought the spell we cast would
keep him contained forever...

06:14.140 --> 06:17.020
...but since Luna and I are
no longer connected to the Elements...

06:17.070 --> 06:19.080
...the spell has been broken.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.770
No longer connected?

06:20.770 --> 06:24.750
This is Canterlot tower, where
the Elements are kept inside...

06:24.750 --> 06:27.120
...since all of you recovered them.

06:27.120 --> 06:31.660
I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony
once again and stop Discord...

06:31.660 --> 06:35.220
...before he thrusts
all of Equestria into eternal chaos.

06:35.350 --> 06:37.170
But why us? Why don't you...?

06:37.180 --> 06:39.130
Hey, look! We're famous!

06:39.130 --> 06:41.820
You six showed the full
potential of the Elements...

06:41.820 --> 06:45.740
...by harnessing the magic of your
friendship to beat a mighty foe.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.380
Although Luna and I
once wielded the Elements...

06:48.380 --> 06:50.780
...it is you, who now control their power.

06:50.780 --> 06:53.560
And it is you, who must defeat Discord!

06:57.520 --> 06:59.590
Princess Celestia, you can count on...

06:59.590 --> 07:00.810
Hold on a second!

07:00.810 --> 07:04.460
Eternal chaos comes with
chocolate rain, you guys!

07:04.460 --> 07:06.310
CHOCOLATE RAIN!

07:06.630 --> 07:08.330
Don't listen to her, Princess.

07:08.330 --> 07:11.090
We'd be honored to use
the Elements of Harmony again.

07:27.130 --> 07:29.660
You can keep the Elements.
I'll take that case.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.430
Have no fear, ponies.

07:31.430 --> 07:34.960
I have total confidence that you
will be able to defeat Discord...

07:35.030 --> 07:36.290
...with these.

07:42.260 --> 07:43.730
Oh well. If anyone needs me...

07:43.740 --> 07:47.920
...I'll be outside in the chocolate
puddles with a giant swizzle straw.

07:49.990 --> 07:51.890
The Elements! They're gone!

07:51.890 --> 07:55.150
That chamber is protected by
a powerful spell that only I can break.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.160
This doesn't make sense...

07:59.580 --> 08:03.610
"Make sense"? Oh, what fun
is there in making sense?

08:03.610 --> 08:05.910
Discord! Show yourself!

08:10.070 --> 08:11.930
Did you miss me, Celestia?

08:13.390 --> 08:14.810
I've missed you.

08:15.310 --> 08:19.370
It's quite lonely being encased in stone.
But you wouldn't know that, would you?

08:19.370 --> 08:23.110
Because I don't turn ponies into stone!

08:24.390 --> 08:27.720
Enough! What have you done
with the Elements of Harmony?

08:27.720 --> 08:31.070
Well, I just borrowed them
for a teensy little while.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.960
You'll never get away
with this, Discord!

08:36.230 --> 08:39.040
Oh, I'd forgotten how grim
you can be, Celestia.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.530
It's really quite boring.

08:41.530 --> 08:43.900
Hey! Nopony insults the Princess!

08:47.440 --> 08:49.660
Oh! You must be Rainbow Dash...

08:49.660 --> 08:53.150
...famed for her loyalty ‒ the Element
of Harmony you represent.

08:53.150 --> 08:56.270
That's right! I'll always
be loyal to the Princess!

08:56.580 --> 08:58.220
We'll see about that.

08:58.220 --> 09:01.640
I can't believe we're wasting our time
talking to a tacky window.

09:01.640 --> 09:05.470
The beautiful Rarity, representing
the Element of Generosity...

09:05.470 --> 09:07.320
...if I'm not mistaken.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.780
So you know who we are. Big deal.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.810
Oh, I know much more than
that, honest Applejack.

09:12.810 --> 09:15.040
You seem to know our strengths too.

09:15.110 --> 09:17.110
Yes, Twilight Sparkle.

09:17.110 --> 09:21.140
And yours is the most powerful
and elusive element ‒ magic.

09:21.140 --> 09:25.540
Fluttershy's is kindness and Pinkie Pie's
is the personal favorite of mine...

09:25.540 --> 09:27.030
...laughter!

09:27.480 --> 09:28.520
Pinkie!

09:29.320 --> 09:31.670
He's standing on your head!

09:32.620 --> 09:34.390
Stop stalling, Discord!

09:34.390 --> 09:36.670
What have you done with
the Elements of Harmony?

09:36.950 --> 09:40.010
Oh! So boring, Celestia. Really.

09:40.010 --> 09:43.820
Fine. I'll tell you, but
I'll only tell you my way.

09:44.800 --> 09:49.170
To retrieve your missing elements,
just make sense of this change of events.

09:49.170 --> 09:52.220
Twists and turns are my master plan...

09:52.220 --> 09:55.780
...then find the Elements
back where you began.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.310
Can we go home now?

09:59.310 --> 10:00.980
What do you reckon he meant?

10:00.980 --> 10:03.450
"Twists and turns" and then
the "back where we started".

10:03.450 --> 10:04.880
Twists and turns...

10:05.180 --> 10:06.840
Twists and turns...

10:07.770 --> 10:09.750
Twists and turns! That's it!

10:09.750 --> 10:12.820
I bet Discord hid the Elements
in the palace labyrinth!

10:13.240 --> 10:15.010
Good luck, my little ponies.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.820
The fate of Equestria is in your hooves.

10:18.820 --> 10:21.160
Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.930
We... We have to go in there?

10:31.110 --> 10:34.770
Nope! Dopey Discord
forgot about these babies!

10:34.970 --> 10:38.190
I'll just do a quick flyover and
we'll have the Elements in no time.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.610
My wings!

10:46.100 --> 10:47.130
Your horn!

10:47.200 --> 10:48.280
My horn!

10:57.940 --> 11:03.090
You... You should see the looks
on your faces. Priceless!

11:04.180 --> 11:05.970
Give us our wings and horns back!

11:05.970 --> 11:07.670
You'll get them back in good time.

11:07.670 --> 11:10.100
I simply took them to ensure
there's no cheating.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.790
You see, this is the first
rule of our game:

11:12.790 --> 11:16.280
No flying and no magic.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.880
The first rule?

11:18.890 --> 11:22.820
The second rule is: everypony has to play
or the game is over.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.980
And I win.

11:25.270 --> 11:27.910
Good luck, everypony!

11:31.700 --> 11:34.190
Never fear, girls. We have each other.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.500
Yeah! Like Twilight said.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.140
There's nothing we can't overcome
if we all stick together.

11:40.470 --> 11:42.990
All right, girls! Let's do this.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.260
Together!

11:49.610 --> 11:50.920
Stay calm, girls!

11:50.920 --> 11:54.330
Everypony head to the middle as fast as
you can and we'll regroup there.

11:54.330 --> 11:56.760
-Moving out!
-See you in the center.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.010
-Yeehaw!
-See you guys there!

12:00.760 --> 12:04.090
What's that?! Who's there?! GIIIRLS!

12:18.600 --> 12:19.980
What in tarnation?

12:25.580 --> 12:26.870
Where am I?

12:36.800 --> 12:38.050
Who are y'all?

12:38.050 --> 12:41.040
The keepers of the grove of truth.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.660
You may ask us...

12:43.050 --> 12:44.890
...a one question:

12:44.890 --> 12:47.320
Past, future or present.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.860
But be warned...

12:48.860 --> 12:50.420
...that the truth...

12:50.430 --> 12:52.800
...may not always be pleasant.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.300
Alright then. I don't trust
this place for the hill a' beans...

12:56.300 --> 12:59.370
...but I got a real bad feelin'
about this feller Discord.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.690
What's gonna come of this
here mission we're on?

13:05.140 --> 13:07.460
For the answer you seek...

13:07.460 --> 13:10.630
...go ahead! Take a peek.

13:13.310 --> 13:15.440
I hope I'll never see you again!

13:15.440 --> 13:16.560
Me too!

13:16.560 --> 13:18.430
-Fine!
-Fine!

13:18.430 --> 13:20.120
It's settled then.

13:24.990 --> 13:25.880
No!

13:25.880 --> 13:28.120
Our friendship... over?

13:33.140 --> 13:37.190
It can't be true. It just can't!

13:42.240 --> 13:44.270
That just can't be the truth.

13:44.270 --> 13:46.460
When all the truth does...

13:46.470 --> 13:48.740
...is make your heart ache...

13:48.740 --> 13:52.930
...sometimes a lie is easier to take.

13:59.260 --> 14:02.900
Applejack! Thank goodness.
I thought I heard voices over here.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.560
Who were you talking to?

14:04.820 --> 14:06.870
I was talkin' to, uh...

14:06.870 --> 14:09.600
Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.

14:11.420 --> 14:12.380
What?

14:12.630 --> 14:13.520
Nothin'.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.890
Come on. Uh, we best be goin'.

14:16.830 --> 14:18.530
Did Applejack just...

14:18.880 --> 14:22.190
Come on, Twilight.
Applejack wouldn't lie.

14:35.630 --> 14:38.180
This is the greatest
balloon garden I've ever seen!

14:38.540 --> 14:41.240
It's the first balloon garden
I've ever seen, but still...

14:47.900 --> 14:49.790
Hey! What gives?

14:49.790 --> 14:53.870
What's the matter, Pinkie Pie?
I thought you appreciated a good laugh.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.820
It's different. They're
laughing *at* me.

14:56.820 --> 14:59.010
It's hardly different.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.570
Your friends laugh at you all the time.

15:01.570 --> 15:04.160
My friends laugh *with* me, not at me.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.930
Oh, really?

15:12.390 --> 15:14.000
No! Stop it!

15:22.320 --> 15:23.910
Stop laughing at me!

15:24.300 --> 15:27.440
Oh, poor Pinkie Pie.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.950
And here I thought
laughter made you happy.

15:33.090 --> 15:34.140
Happy?

15:35.260 --> 15:37.070
I don't think so.

15:40.730 --> 15:43.180
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you.

15:43.180 --> 15:46.780
You are, huh? WHY? Need a good laugh?

15:46.780 --> 15:47.880
Pinkie?

15:49.280 --> 15:52.480
What do you suppose has her
so upset? It's not like her.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.980
I didn't notice anythin'
strange about Pinkie.

15:56.940 --> 16:01.210
Weird. Better pick up the pace before
the stress of this gets the better of all of us.

16:04.490 --> 16:10.020
I was expecting an audience with
the Princess, not outdoor sports.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.380
Oh my.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.850
Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity.

16:20.850 --> 16:26.030
You've found the one thing in Equestria
that could rival my face for sheer beauty.

16:28.650 --> 16:31.360
What do you think? You like?

16:31.540 --> 16:35.020
Yes... I like very much.

16:37.350 --> 16:41.570
NO! No. I shan't succumb
to such fabulousness.

16:41.920 --> 16:46.520
Must... get to the center...
to meet... the others...

16:48.870 --> 16:49.990
MINE!!!

16:53.080 --> 16:54.560
Well, Rarity...

16:54.560 --> 16:56.950
It took forever, but it was worth it.

16:59.160 --> 17:04.320
Who knew three little gemstones would turn out
to be this handsome HUNK of a diamond?

17:04.940 --> 17:07.480
Now to get you home.

17:15.350 --> 17:17.710
Rarity! Are we glad to see...

17:18.140 --> 17:20.250
Why are you carrying
a humongous boulder?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.830
What do you mean "boulder"?

17:22.830 --> 17:27.080
This big, beautiful, bedazzling
rock is a DIAMOND!

17:27.080 --> 17:29.210
And it's all mine.

17:29.510 --> 17:31.280
Keep your envious little eyes off it!

17:31.280 --> 17:34.120
I found it and it's mine,
fair and square!

17:46.460 --> 17:48.470
Okay, I can do this. I can...

17:50.600 --> 17:51.820
Oh! Wait a minute!

17:51.820 --> 17:55.030
Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!

18:00.970 --> 18:02.150
Fluttershy.

18:02.150 --> 18:06.650
Looks like you've been left behind
by your so-called friends, huh?

18:07.430 --> 18:11.440
Oh, no. I'm certain they're
doing their best to find me.

18:11.500 --> 18:16.190
Well, it must be so upsetting to know how
weak and helpless they think you are.

18:16.430 --> 18:17.580
Not at all!

18:17.580 --> 18:21.070
I *am* weak and helpless and
I appreciate their understanding.

18:21.070 --> 18:24.200
Yes, well... surely it burns you up, I mean...

18:24.200 --> 18:27.590
...that they're always
pointing out your flaws, right?

18:27.590 --> 18:29.060
Not really. In fact...

18:29.060 --> 18:34.010
I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends
who want me to be the best I can be.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.020
Oh, for goodness's sake!

18:37.560 --> 18:39.740
You've been kind for
far too long, my dear.

18:39.740 --> 18:41.740
Time to be cruel!

18:41.740 --> 18:43.500
Arrivederci!

18:46.410 --> 18:49.690
Fluttershy! I'm so glad
to see your friendly face.

18:49.690 --> 18:52.200
This awful labyrinth is
getting to everypony.

18:54.290 --> 18:56.320
Oh, boo hoo hoo!

18:57.470 --> 19:00.960
Why don't you wave your magic little horn
and make everything all right?

19:02.040 --> 19:05.510
Oh, that's right. You can't.
You don't have one.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.180
What is happening to my friends?

19:10.340 --> 19:12.550
And what are YOU laughing at?!

19:12.810 --> 19:13.800
Chocolate milk!

19:14.430 --> 19:16.060
Little help here?

19:17.580 --> 19:18.930
Thanks, Twilight.

19:19.180 --> 19:21.630
-You're welcome...
-But don't get any ideas about my gem!

19:21.930 --> 19:23.840
I know where you live.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.390
I've got you now, Element.

19:40.920 --> 19:45.330
I can see why you like these
clouds so much. Very plush.

19:45.530 --> 19:48.730
Get off there and put 'em up!
C'mon, let's go!

19:48.730 --> 19:51.660
Hey, I'm here to deliver a message.

19:51.660 --> 19:53.580
I've got a message for you too!

19:53.580 --> 19:56.250
Listen closely. This is important.

19:56.350 --> 20:00.350
A weighty choice is yours to make ‒
The right selection or a big mistake.

20:00.350 --> 20:06.240
If the wrong choice you choose to pursue,
The foundations of home will crumble without you.

20:10.020 --> 20:14.170
Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me...

20:15.450 --> 20:16.790
NO!!!

20:18.270 --> 20:21.490
That box contains your wings.
You can take them and leave the game...

20:21.490 --> 20:26.590
...or you can carry on aimlessly
wandering this maze. Your choice.

20:32.960 --> 20:36.440
Must... find... Rainbow Dash...

20:36.990 --> 20:40.620
As a team... we're unstoppable.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.910
Rainbow Dash won't let us down.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.540
Well, lookie there.

20:45.540 --> 20:48.910
Rainbow Dash is flyin' away.
She's abandonin' us.

20:48.910 --> 20:50.720
Now I know that's a lie.

20:51.480 --> 20:52.970
How can it be?!

21:03.730 --> 21:09.270
Well, well, well. Somepony broke
the "no wings, no magic" rule.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.900
Game's over, my little ponies.

21:14.900 --> 21:18.070
You didn't find your precious elements.

21:18.550 --> 21:24.080
Looks like we might be due
for a big old storm of chaos.

21:33.320 --> 21:36.820
