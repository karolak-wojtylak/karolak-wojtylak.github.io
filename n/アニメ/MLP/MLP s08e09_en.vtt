WEBVTT

00:06.306 --> 00:07.039
Huh?

00:10.878 --> 00:11.577
Oh!

00:16.717 --> 00:18.450
Did I miss the Teacher of
the Month announcement?

00:18.852 --> 00:19.919
You're just in time.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.387
But it's gonna be me.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.457
Yeah, right! I got
this one nailed.

00:24.859 --> 00:27.459
And the Friendship School
teacher of the month is...

00:28.362 --> 00:29.561
Fluttershy!

00:29.863 --> 00:31.697
Ugh. Again..?

00:31.799 --> 00:33.032
Come on!

00:33.334 --> 00:37.002
Oh, my. I don't know
how I keep winning.

00:40.073 --> 00:42.007
Yeah, me neither.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.543
The award is based on
the students' vote.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.345
They must really like you!

00:50.951 --> 00:52.751
Congratulations,
Fluttershy.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.226
Next item of business.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.861
I've been looking
into a new activity

01:02.963 --> 01:04.429
for our friendship classes.

01:04.831 --> 01:05.597
Spike?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.772
Section 147,
paragraph 2 states

01:13.874 --> 01:16.175
that teamwork is a key
part of friendship.

01:16.277 --> 01:19.078
And section 229, paragraph 9
says outdoor activity

01:19.180 --> 01:20.646
reinforces learning.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.382
Add that together
and what do you get?

01:23.584 --> 01:24.601
Ooh ooh!

01:24.702 --> 01:28.619
OK, lemme see 147,
229 carry the two.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.989
Three hundred and eighty-seven?

01:30.491 --> 01:32.791
Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip!

01:32.893 --> 01:35.460
Leading it is a Teacher
of the Month type-job,

01:35.662 --> 01:36.628
so I thought I'd ask-

01:36.730 --> 01:38.263
I'm yer pony, Twilight.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.332
Sweet Apple Acres has
taught me a thing or two

01:40.434 --> 01:41.702
about workin' together.

01:41.803 --> 01:45.971
Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's
the definition of teamwork.

01:46.073 --> 01:50.242
Heh heh heh, I'm sure you're
not sayin' fancy flyin'

01:50.344 --> 01:52.811
makes ya a better
choice than me.

01:53.213 --> 01:56.648
Heh heh heh heh, I
wouldn't say<i> better,</i>

01:56.750 --> 01:59.751
just a little
more<i> qualified.</i>

01:59.853 --> 02:00.686
No offense.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.889
Maybe you can lead the
field trip together!

02:04.758 --> 02:06.158
Bu-
Gah!

02:06.260 --> 02:07.194
Of course!

02:07.295 --> 02:10.129
Who better to model the
importance of working as a team?

02:10.331 --> 02:13.365
Um, Rarity,
Fluttershy, me, Spike.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.867
This flower pot.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.202
BOTH of you are
teamwork experts.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.504
If the students see the two
of you teaching together,

02:19.606 --> 02:20.806
they'll learn even more.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.108
I know you've been
competitive in the past,

02:23.210 --> 02:25.577
but I'm SURE you'd never
let that get in the way of

02:25.679 --> 02:26.879
friendship education!

02:27.281 --> 02:28.347
'A course.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.481
Totally.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.596
I've never been on
a field trip before.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.867
Yeah, what's the point
of this, exactly?

03:21.969 --> 03:24.136
Getting out of the
classroom, duh.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.337
Yak best at
field tripping!

03:28.208 --> 03:29.808
That's what we're doing!?

03:30.010 --> 03:31.377
SO FUN!

03:33.180 --> 03:34.080
Heh heh.

03:34.181 --> 03:37.481
Pretty sure the Headmare has
something else in mind.

03:37.684 --> 03:38.868
All right, class.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.353
Today you'll learn how
important working together is

03:41.455 --> 03:43.655
for building a strong
friendship.

03:44.157 --> 03:44.974
Hey y'all!

03:45.075 --> 03:46.692
Ready to get out there
and do some learnin'

03:46.794 --> 03:48.511
the Apple family way?

03:48.612 --> 03:50.729
This is basically gonna
be the best field trip

03:50.831 --> 03:52.831
in the history of ever.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.599
With me in charge, that is.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.501
Heh heh.

03:56.603 --> 03:58.470
With <i>us</i>  in charge.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.172
Meanin' mostly me.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.775
Yeah. Good one.

04:02.076 --> 04:05.577
And what teamwork activity do
you two have planned for today?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.013
Shed-building.
Canoe-racing.

04:08.315 --> 04:11.083
No way. We get
to do BOTH?

04:11.285 --> 04:14.986
I bet that's exactly what
your teachers had in mind.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.724
Why don't you start with
shed-building first?

04:19.426 --> 04:21.460
Heh. Don't mind if I do!

04:21.562 --> 04:23.762
Everycreature,
follow the leader!

04:26.233 --> 04:28.333
I'll check in later
to see how it's going.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.802
Remember to work together!

04:35.909 --> 04:38.376
Now take a good deep breath.

04:38.478 --> 04:39.478
What do ya smell?

04:40.114 --> 04:42.281
[sniff] Ugh. Yak?

04:44.184 --> 04:45.084
Mm-hm!

04:45.686 --> 04:47.018
Nope. Try again.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.654
Um...apples?

04:50.591 --> 04:53.358
AND... Anyone? Anyone? No?

04:54.161 --> 04:57.696
The promise of... teamwork!

04:57.798 --> 04:59.732
That there's an apple shed.

05:00.234 --> 05:03.001
And this here is what we're
gonna use to build it!

05:03.203 --> 05:05.570
Nothin' brings friends together
like a little hard work

05:05.672 --> 05:06.872
and honest sweat.

05:09.776 --> 05:12.143
Sweat? Seriously?

05:12.345 --> 05:14.179
That's supposed to be
part of friendship?

05:14.681 --> 05:17.682
Not everypony would
know that, Rainbow Dash.

05:17.884 --> 05:20.519
Just Teacher of the
Month kinda ponies.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.587
Whatever. Let's
just get this done

05:22.689 --> 05:24.823
so we can move on
to my activity!

05:35.569 --> 05:38.870
That's it! Measure
twice, and cut once.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.439
Haste makes waste.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.741
Slow and steady.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.510
Emphasis on the slow.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.655
Rainbow Dash!

05:57.057 --> 05:59.124
You can't build an
apple shed like that!

05:59.826 --> 06:01.727
Oh, yeah? I just did!

06:04.564 --> 06:07.065
Whoa! No way!

06:07.667 --> 06:09.434
All: Whoa!

06:09.536 --> 06:10.587
Impressive...

06:10.788 --> 06:13.339
if you can call an
apple shed impressive.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.475
Just 'cause it's fast
don't mean it's good.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.743
Oh, sorry!
Can't hear you.

06:18.845 --> 06:22.247
Too busy practicing my
Teacher of the Month pose.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.915
Yeah! Yeah!

06:24.017 --> 06:25.318
Hoo wah!

06:25.419 --> 06:28.620
Don't count your pictures before
they're snapped, Rainbow Dash.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.289
Oh, come on!

06:30.591 --> 06:32.257
These students are
totally gonna vote

06:32.359 --> 06:34.326
for a teacher who
gets things done!

06:34.428 --> 06:36.495
No, they're gonna
vote for a teacher

06:36.597 --> 06:38.464
who gets things done right!

06:39.566 --> 06:43.001
Yeah, this isn't awkward at all.

06:53.046 --> 06:56.281
Applejack: Steady, steady.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.184
Take her nice and slow.

07:00.654 --> 07:03.121
Little to the left.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.726
A hair to the right.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.163
Now a hoofshavin' higher.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.633
Grrrr.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.234
JUST BRING IT DOWN ALREADY!

07:21.441 --> 07:23.208
Heh heh.

07:23.910 --> 07:27.012
I'll give ya one guess whose
side is still standin.'

07:27.414 --> 07:28.547
Yak side!

07:33.954 --> 07:35.687
Um, professors?

07:35.889 --> 07:38.523
I'm a little confused
about teamwork now.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.593
That's because you need
a different teacher.

07:41.695 --> 07:42.795
Follow me!

07:42.896 --> 07:45.496
Last one to the stream
is a rotten apple shed!

07:46.366 --> 07:47.365
Grr.

07:48.167 --> 07:51.369
Who's ready to smash the all-
time Equestria speed record

07:51.471 --> 07:52.771
for river canoeing?

07:55.342 --> 07:56.775
Is that even a thing?

07:56.877 --> 07:58.328
First I've heard of it.

07:58.429 --> 08:01.680
We need to get to the finish
line before this alarm goes off!

08:01.782 --> 08:03.548
That means you gotta move fast!

08:10.891 --> 08:11.957
Any questions?

08:12.459 --> 08:14.425
Um. Yona have questions.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.127
No time for 'em!
Get in the boat.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.566
You really think winnin'
some canoin' record

08:21.668 --> 08:24.036
is gonna get you that
teacher of the month trophy?

08:24.538 --> 08:27.539
I'm pretty sure every creature's
gonna like it a lot better

08:27.641 --> 08:30.575
than pounding nails
and cutting wood.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.148
Yak not like water.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.752
Sometimes, when I'm scared to
try something new, I whistle.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.160
We got you, Yona.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.733
Way I see it, Twilight's gonna
give that teachin' trophy

08:54.835 --> 08:57.602
to a TEACHER, not a RACER.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.871
We'll see about that.

09:01.408 --> 09:05.143
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder!

09:05.445 --> 09:07.779
Put your back into it, newbies!

09:08.081 --> 09:15.420
Stroooke, stroooke,
stroooke, slower!

09:15.689 --> 09:18.723
Focus on your paddle
technique, y'all!

09:20.360 --> 09:21.826
WHOO HOO!

09:21.928 --> 09:24.028
We're really going now!

09:26.767 --> 09:30.902
So, when do we get to
the part when we move?

09:33.907 --> 09:37.175
When everycreature
starts listening to <i>me</i>.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.945
The leader of my
activity, Applejack.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.483
NOW STROKE!

09:55.328 --> 09:56.361
Dig in team!

09:56.463 --> 09:58.263
We can still beat that record!

10:01.101 --> 10:02.066
Stop!

10:02.702 --> 10:03.435
Go!

10:03.837 --> 10:05.070
Which way do we go?

10:05.472 --> 10:06.271
Left!

10:06.473 --> 10:07.172
Right!

10:07.373 --> 10:09.072
Aye-aye, captains!

10:09.175 --> 10:10.175
Wait, what?

10:10.377 --> 10:11.210
Left!

10:11.311 --> 10:13.544
I can see the finish
line from here!

10:15.649 --> 10:17.448
If we go left, we'll
be headin straight

10:17.550 --> 10:19.117
into the Bite-acuda fish!

10:19.319 --> 10:21.252
Who cares about a few fish?

10:21.354 --> 10:22.821
Uh, professors?

10:22.923 --> 10:25.156
You'll care plenty
when they bite ya!

10:25.258 --> 10:26.174
Guys?

10:26.275 --> 10:27.891
Rainbow Dash: We'll just
go around them.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.194
ROCK!

10:50.951 --> 10:52.784
I LOVE FIELD TRIPS!

10:54.120 --> 10:55.788
I hope you're happy.

10:57.190 --> 11:01.125
Obviously not, because there
goes our new speed record!

11:04.130 --> 11:05.731
Help!

11:06.633 --> 11:08.366
Yak not swim!

11:13.840 --> 11:14.790
That's OK.

11:14.891 --> 11:17.241
Your friends can change
into creatures that do!

11:20.881 --> 11:23.949
Twilight: How's the
canoeing..... going?

11:24.651 --> 11:27.453
About as good as the
apple shed building.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.722
I totally had things
under control,

11:30.924 --> 11:33.424
until Applejack messed 'em up.

11:33.726 --> 11:34.725
I did not!

11:34.927 --> 11:35.960
Did too!

11:36.162 --> 11:37.162
Did not!

11:37.564 --> 11:40.631
Yeah. It's been
like this all day.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.534
I wouldn't say
all day.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.204
Just, 99% of it.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.409
I can't believe this!

11:51.611 --> 11:53.144
You're not teaching teamwork;

11:53.246 --> 11:54.646
you're competing
with each other.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.581
I thought you were past that!

11:57.083 --> 11:58.183
We are!

11:58.885 --> 11:59.884
Mostly...

12:00.086 --> 12:01.552
We got carried away with

12:01.654 --> 12:03.922
wantin' to be the Teacher
of the Month, is all.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.556
The Teacher of the
Month wouldn't care

12:05.658 --> 12:07.225
about being the
Teacher of the Month!

12:07.427 --> 12:08.760
I know Fluttershy
would be thrilled

12:08.862 --> 12:10.261
to see another pony win.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.529
That's it!

12:11.631 --> 12:13.464
I'm taking over
this field trip.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.069
Hold up, Twilight.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.971
Don't count out Rainbow Dash
for the award just yet.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.274
You should've seen her fire up
those students to build a shed!

12:23.676 --> 12:27.211
No way! <i>You're</i> the one
the students listen to.

12:27.313 --> 12:30.849
Besides, you saved us from
those pony-eating fish.

12:33.853 --> 12:34.637
Long story.

12:34.738 --> 12:38.022
But Applejack should definitely
be teacher of the month.

12:38.825 --> 12:42.427
Hmmm. Maybe you two have
learned something after all.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.930
Does that mean you'll give us
another chance at the Teacher of the--

12:46.632 --> 12:47.465
--Field Trip?

12:48.835 --> 12:50.035
Well...

12:50.337 --> 12:53.238
C'mon, Twilight.
We get it.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.439
No more arguing.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.607
Right, Applejack?

12:55.709 --> 12:57.709
Right as rain and
twice as fresh!

12:59.779 --> 13:00.613
Fine.

13:00.814 --> 13:03.448
But I'm picking the next
activity you two lead.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.749
A nature walk.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.285
Nopony could possibly
argue over that.

13:07.687 --> 13:08.553
Right?

13:09.055 --> 13:09.888
Right!

13:10.090 --> 13:10.922
See?

13:11.024 --> 13:12.624
We're agreein' already!

13:20.467 --> 13:22.000
Well, look at that!

13:22.402 --> 13:24.369
The path splits up ahead.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.871
Left or right?

13:28.908 --> 13:30.809
Here we go again.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.344
Where to, Rainbow Dash?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.447
I was thinking right.

13:35.749 --> 13:37.782
Unless you want to go left.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.886
Because what makes you
happy, makes me happy.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.355
Ah, heck, forget about me.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.791
Applejack: You want to go right,
we'll go right.

13:46.893 --> 13:52.097
Rainbow Dash: But teamwork means listening to
other ponies, so it's up to you.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.400
Applejack: Well, aren't you as
sweet as sugar apple pie.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.902
But it's up to you.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.237
Grrrr. Follow me.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.638
Yak know best way.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.543
Hey, where y'all goin'?

14:54.627 --> 14:58.363
I think we've gone in the
same circle five times.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.866
Only because 'SOMEponies'
won't make up their minds

15:01.968 --> 15:03.635
about which way to go.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.606
Do you want to keep going
in a circle, Applejack?

15:08.708 --> 15:12.377
Up to you, Rainbow
Dash. I insist.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.747
[chuckle] No no,<i> I</i> insist.

15:15.849 --> 15:19.050
Heh. But<i> I </i>insisted first.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.252
Are we still on a field trip?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.554
Cause this just feels
like being lost.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.497
We can still get back
to school before dark

15:32.599 --> 15:35.133
if we cross that ravine
and stop doubling back.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.669
We knew that.

15:37.871 --> 15:41.239
All part of our plan,
right, Applejack?

15:41.341 --> 15:46.311
Uh.. yep. All we have to
do is.... build a bridge

15:46.613 --> 15:50.615
across that.. giant canyon
and we're home free!

15:50.817 --> 15:53.885
That is if, if you think
a bridge is a good idea.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.054
Only if you want
to build a bridge.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.023
STOP!

15:57.224 --> 16:00.791
Listen, we can just fly
everyone over and be done.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.994
Nope. There's still
plenty of time

16:03.096 --> 16:05.429
to teach y'all a
lesson in teamwork.

16:05.531 --> 16:06.731
Cooperation!

16:06.833 --> 16:08.032
Togetherness!

16:08.134 --> 16:10.034
You are so right!

16:10.136 --> 16:11.769
Only as right as you are!

16:11.871 --> 16:14.872
OK! We'll build the
bridge. What do we use?

16:15.074 --> 16:16.240
Vines!                                               Branches!

16:16.809 --> 16:17.776
Branches!                                        Vines!

16:18.478 --> 16:20.645
I'm goin' with your idea: vines.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.246
No buts about it.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.015
I'm building
with your idea.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.217
Branches. End of story.

16:54.747 --> 16:58.316
Why use a branch when
you could use a vine!

17:13.884 --> 17:16.935
Why didn't I think of
branches to begin with?

17:17.237 --> 17:17.802
They're so...

17:19.472 --> 17:21.205
...easy to work with.

17:25.912 --> 17:29.615
These here vines are just
the thing, Rainbow Dash!

17:31.117 --> 17:35.419
Not to disagree, but these here
branches are the way to--

17:41.761 --> 17:43.961
HELP!

17:46.466 --> 17:49.233
At least now they're
agreeing on something.

17:56.611 --> 17:59.844
[groaning] I can't get out!

18:00.046 --> 18:01.112
Let me try.

18:11.891 --> 18:12.823
Let me guess.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.659
Bite-acudas?

18:17.363 --> 18:20.899
Mm hm. And they
look mighty hungry.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.601
We gotta get our
professors out of there!

18:23.703 --> 18:25.436
Anycreature have a plan?

18:25.838 --> 18:26.938
Leave 'em hanging?

18:27.540 --> 18:28.372
What!?

18:28.674 --> 18:29.607
I'm kidding...

18:30.409 --> 18:31.076
Kinda.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.944
We need to work
fast, and together.

18:36.315 --> 18:37.281
But mainly fast.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.754
I hate to admit it, but...

18:43.956 --> 18:46.857
this whole mess is
kinda our fault.

18:47.159 --> 18:50.929
Yeah. No trophy is worth
getting eaten over.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.898
So whaddya say, ya wanna team
up and get ourselves

18:54.000 --> 18:55.666
outta this here pickle barrel?

18:55.768 --> 18:57.735
I thought you'd never ask!

18:58.871 --> 18:59.904
Ahhh!!

19:00.406 --> 19:01.039
Don't worry!

19:01.140 --> 19:02.373
I'm just the distraction.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.409
Ocellus..?

19:04.911 --> 19:07.578
You nearly scared the
cutie marks off us!

19:23.729 --> 19:25.062
Need a lift?

19:30.937 --> 19:32.770
Yak smash!

19:41.047 --> 19:43.247
Welcome back, Professors!

19:43.449 --> 19:45.750
Now that was a rescue!

19:45.852 --> 19:47.718
And y'all did it together!

19:51.157 --> 19:53.758
No big. Those fish
weren't even a thing.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.427
Wha'!

19:56.730 --> 19:58.729
Heh heh. Oops. Sorry.

20:00.868 --> 20:04.535
Ha ha! BEST. FIELD TRIP. EVER!

20:09.474 --> 20:10.118
Huh?

20:10.343 --> 20:11.576
How was the field trip?

20:12.578 --> 20:13.846
What did you all learn?

20:14.447 --> 20:15.423
Er....

20:15.548 --> 20:17.715
Yak learn ponies smart!

20:17.817 --> 20:20.351
Yeah! Professors Applejack
and Rainbow Dash

20:20.453 --> 20:21.953
were such good teachers.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.222
It was kinda crazy genius.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.390
They showed us what not
to do so we'd figure

20:26.492 --> 20:27.825
out what we should do.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.128
Really?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.463
It took us a
while to get it.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.398
Especially at the ravine.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.435
It would have been so much
easier to just fly home.

20:37.637 --> 20:41.138
But instead, our professors
built bridges the wrong way

20:41.240 --> 20:43.808
just to show us how
important teamwork is.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.110
Yeah, that was super-dangerous.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.678
Talk about commitment!

20:48.815 --> 20:52.817
We know it's too early to
pick the Teacher of the Month.

20:53.019 --> 20:56.921
But we'd like you to consider
Rainbow Dash and Applejack.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.789
Thank you for telling me!

20:58.891 --> 21:01.726
I'm so glad to hear your
field trip was a success.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.728
I'll make sure to schedule
another one right away!

21:08.234 --> 21:12.637
You were actually just competing
the entire time, weren't you?

21:13.039 --> 21:14.705
To tell ya the truth?

21:15.107 --> 21:16.107
Yeah.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.542
Well, not <i>all</i> the time.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.878
I agreed with you for
the whole nature walk!

21:20.980 --> 21:24.181
Only cause you were anglin' for
that Teacher of the Month award.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.318
YOU were the one
doing the angling.
