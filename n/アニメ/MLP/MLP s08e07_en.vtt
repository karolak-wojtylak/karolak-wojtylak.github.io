WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:02.985
Twilight: Princess Celestia,

00:03.186 --> 00:05.303
I have an idea for
your Onesversary!

00:05.506 --> 00:07.639
My...Onesversary?

00:07.741 --> 00:10.075
The one thousand one hundred
eleventh year anniversary

00:10.177 --> 00:11.844
of when you first
raised the sun.

00:11.946 --> 00:13.512
Good thing Pinkie
Pie reminded us,

00:13.614 --> 00:15.281
or we woulda forgot
to celebrate!

00:15.883 --> 00:17.382
You're not the only ones.

00:17.484 --> 00:18.718
What did you have in mind?

00:18.919 --> 00:22.353
To commemorate your first
sunrise, I've written a play.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.690
We'd like to perform it at
my School of Friendship.

00:24.792 --> 00:25.791
If you don't mind.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.627
[excited laugh] Ooh!

00:28.829 --> 00:29.628
Mind?

00:29.730 --> 00:31.463
Oh, of course not!

00:31.565 --> 00:35.600
Oh, I think a play
is a fantastic idea!

00:35.702 --> 00:37.636
Did she just...
prance?

00:38.538 --> 00:41.440
Oh. Forgive me for
getting so excited.

00:41.742 --> 00:42.741
I-it's just...

00:42.843 --> 00:46.478
When I was a filly, my
friends often put on plays.

00:46.680 --> 00:50.516
Oh, it was so wonderful;
everypony coming together

00:50.618 --> 00:54.019
to create a magical experience
to share with others.

00:54.321 --> 00:57.489
I've always believed theatre
brings out the best in us,

00:57.691 --> 01:00.259
and forges a special
bond of friendship.

01:01.128 --> 01:03.094
I didn't know you used to act!

01:03.597 --> 01:05.197
Oh, not me.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.432
I was always too busy
with my magic lessons

01:07.534 --> 01:09.435
to be part of any
plays myself.

01:09.637 --> 01:13.238
But still, it's something
I always wished

01:13.340 --> 01:14.773
I could experience.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.475
And you still can!

01:16.677 --> 01:17.894
Princess Celestia...

01:17.995 --> 01:20.812
we would be honored if you
would be the star of our play!

01:21.348 --> 01:22.347
WE WOULD?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.788
You want me to
star in your play!?

02:03.090 --> 02:05.824
Yeah, when did that
happen exactly?

02:05.926 --> 02:07.859
If you'll excuse
us for a second...

02:09.296 --> 02:10.529
Don't you see, Spike?

02:10.631 --> 02:11.581
It's perfect!

02:11.782 --> 02:14.432
Princess Celestia has always
wanted to be in a play,

02:14.535 --> 02:16.902
and this one's about her!

02:17.004 --> 02:17.987
I guess...

02:18.088 --> 02:19.871
But how are we supposed
to give her directions?

02:20.073 --> 02:21.840
She's the ruler of Equestria!

02:21.942 --> 02:23.442
She's also our friend.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.844
Celestia's always
kind to everypony.

02:26.046 --> 02:29.047
So if we have a chance to
finally do something for her,

02:29.249 --> 02:30.149
we should!

02:30.651 --> 02:31.668
Hmmm.

02:31.869 --> 02:34.586
C'mon, how many times
has Celestia helped us?

02:34.688 --> 02:35.455
Guided us.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.723
Been a warm calming
voice over our shoulder-

02:38.025 --> 02:38.890
Twilight?
[startled gasps]

02:39.092 --> 02:40.726
Yes, Princess Celestia?

02:40.828 --> 02:42.994
Your invitation
is very kind.

02:43.196 --> 02:45.030
But are you certain
it's wise?

02:45.132 --> 02:48.166
I have no acting
experience at all.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.035
Experience? Pssh!

02:50.137 --> 02:51.636
You'll be playing yourself!

02:51.738 --> 02:52.971
And we'll all help you.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.206
Please?

02:54.407 --> 02:56.006
It'd mean so much
to the students

02:56.109 --> 02:57.342
if you were in our show.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.878
Well, if you're sure...

03:02.182 --> 03:03.715
Yeah, what she said.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.352
Then I would be delighted
to join your theatre troupe!

03:07.921 --> 03:09.020
Whoo hoo!

03:11.392 --> 03:12.791
Confetti is ready!

03:12.893 --> 03:14.326
Hoo hoo!

03:14.828 --> 03:16.528
Wormy applecores, Pinkie!

03:16.630 --> 03:19.030
How many times have I told ya
to keep your special effects

03:19.132 --> 03:20.899
away from my sets?

03:21.301 --> 03:22.501
Three hundred twenty-seven.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.136
Ooh! Unless you just DID.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.670
Then it's three
hundred twenty-eight!

03:26.440 --> 03:26.907
Ugh.

03:27.008 --> 03:30.375
I can't believe you've memorized
your lines already, Fluttershy.

03:30.477 --> 03:33.211
Once you get past terrifying,
paralyzing stage fright,

03:33.313 --> 03:34.513
the rest is easy.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.147
Now I just hope
Princess Celestia

03:36.249 --> 03:37.783
says we can do our play.

03:37.985 --> 03:41.653
Oh! As soon as she sees
these fabulous costumes,

03:41.755 --> 03:44.789
all she'll be able
to say is 'brava!'

03:46.460 --> 03:48.676
Heads up!
Here comes our answer.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.763
Wonderful news, everypony!

03:51.899 --> 03:53.265
Yeeeha!

03:53.367 --> 03:54.666
We get to put on our show?

03:54.768 --> 03:55.685
Even better.

03:55.786 --> 03:58.203
Princess Celestia is
gonna be our star!

03:59.506 --> 04:01.640
Yeah, that's how I felt, too.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.376
Celestia? Starring in our play?

04:04.478 --> 04:05.677
This is huge!

04:05.979 --> 04:08.513
Well, she was a little
nervous at first,

04:08.615 --> 04:10.182
but I told her not to worry.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.717
With us helping, it'll
all go smooth as--

04:12.819 --> 04:13.818
SILK! [zoom]

04:15.722 --> 04:17.222
I must find the silk!

04:17.324 --> 04:18.990
If Celestia is going
to be in our play,

04:19.092 --> 04:21.493
we have to take everything
up to the next level!

04:21.895 --> 04:24.129
None of these old
ideas will do!

04:24.298 --> 04:26.298
Yeah! Forget my
regular party cannon.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.634
For princess-size effects, we're
gonna need "Big Bertha!"

04:31.038 --> 04:32.938
Applejack: Grrr... PINKIE!

04:33.307 --> 04:34.239
What?

04:34.541 --> 04:36.241
Our play is gonna be AMAZING!

04:36.343 --> 04:37.843
I gotta tell everypony I know!

04:37.945 --> 04:39.111
And even the ones I don't!

04:41.515 --> 04:44.383
Why in tarnation are y'all
gettin' so star-struck?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.585
We've met Princess
Celestia before.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.654
Plenty of times.

04:47.855 --> 04:51.322
Those were formal things,
galas, world-saving.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.958
This is different.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.328
Imagine doing sweaty
warm-ups with a princess.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.597
Blowing your nose in
front of a princess.

04:58.699 --> 05:02.067
Sitting around just...
talking with a princess.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.703
I'm a princess.
You talk to me.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.456
That's different.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.907
You're not a
PRINCESS princess.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.943
Uh... thanks.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.712
Celestia wants to experience
the special friendship

05:13.814 --> 05:15.147
that theatre ponies have.

05:15.249 --> 05:17.649
To give her that, you just
need to be yourselves.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.151
You...you really
think so?

05:20.453 --> 05:22.254
Heh. Aw, quit frettin'.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.423
It's only a coupla
pals gettin' together

05:24.525 --> 05:26.391
to put on a Onesversary play.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.926
What could go wrong?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.580
Spike: Places, everypony.

05:30.681 --> 05:33.132
We're here to rehearse
"A New Day in Equestria!"

05:33.700 --> 05:34.900
Ahem.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.503
Directed, written, and
produced by Twilight Sparkle.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.341
Page 1, Act 1, Scene 1.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.375
ACTION!

05:46.513 --> 05:49.581
Once upon a time,
before Celestia,

05:49.683 --> 05:52.717
Equestria was suffering
terrible hardship.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.186
Raising the sun every
morning was so hard,

05:55.288 --> 05:57.188
it took five great sorcerers

05:57.290 --> 06:00.058
plus Starswirl the
Bearded to do it.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.534
And every day, the unicorns
helping Starswirl

06:09.636 --> 06:13.205
would use so much magic,
they lost their powers...

06:13.607 --> 06:14.606
forever!

06:14.908 --> 06:16.675
Things looked bleak.

06:16.777 --> 06:20.579
Soon, Equestria would
lose all its magic-users!

06:20.781 --> 06:25.684
Then, the land would be covered
in darkness for eternity.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.523
Even I can't believe
how good my play is.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.526
The sets, the props, the
outfits, they're all great!

06:34.828 --> 06:37.062
And, here comes
the best part.

06:37.364 --> 06:41.232
But then, a student named
Celestia discovered she had the

06:41.334 --> 06:45.771
power to raise the sun herself,
without draining her magic!

06:48.609 --> 06:51.376
Um...that's your
cue, Celestia.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.845
Oh! Right! Of course.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.213
Ahe-heh-hem.

06:55.600 --> 07:00.784
[soft and awkward]
It is time for a new
day in Equestria.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.854
Um. What?

07:03.156 --> 07:04.389
Oh, uh, I said...

07:04.491 --> 07:09.194
It is time for a new
day in Equestria.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.198
And your delivery was...great.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.634
But maybe you should try
it a tiny bit louder.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.235
For the ponies in
the back row.

07:17.537 --> 07:20.137
Oh, yes, yes.
My Royal Canterlot Voice.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.873
Thank you for the
reminder, Twilight.

07:22.543 --> 07:28.179
IT IS TIME FOR A NEW
DAY IN EQUESTRIA!

07:30.651 --> 07:34.319
Oh, goodness, this theatre
does have strong acoustics.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.754
My apologies.

07:35.856 --> 07:38.389
I'm still learning to
"hone my craft."

07:38.491 --> 07:40.792
No, no, you're doing...fine.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.427
Why don't we try it
one more time?

07:42.529 --> 07:43.996
Just like you're
talking to me.

07:44.398 --> 07:49.501
[robotic] It is time for a
new day in Equestria.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.070
A bit more energy.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.672
[overdone] It's time for a
new day in Equestria!

07:55.208 --> 07:56.708
Uh...How was that?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.243
Honestly...?

07:58.712 --> 08:00.062
Great! Wow!

08:00.163 --> 08:02.113
It's hard to believe you've
never done this before!

08:02.315 --> 08:04.082
Let's move on to
the dance number.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.621
Again! Step, buck,
leap, touch...

08:09.823 --> 08:10.523
Again!

08:10.624 --> 08:12.724
Step, buck, leap, touch...

08:13.126 --> 08:13.758
Got it?

08:13.960 --> 08:14.593
Movin' on.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.695
Five, six, seven, eight!

08:17.531 --> 08:20.198
Come ON, StarSWIRL!

08:20.400 --> 08:26.871
Throw OFF that musty HAT,
and let's have a-a dance!

08:34.047 --> 08:34.880
Oh, dear.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.914
I think we have a problem.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.819
Yeah. Our lead actress
is a disaster!

08:46.660 --> 08:47.626
What are we gonna do?

08:47.827 --> 08:49.393
If I tell Celestia
she's terrible,

08:49.596 --> 08:50.829
it'll hurt her feelings.

08:50.931 --> 08:51.908
And I'll be a bad friend.

08:52.109 --> 08:53.086
But if I keep her
in the show,

08:53.187 --> 08:55.064
she'll be the laughing stock
of Equestria.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.535
And I'll be a worse friend!

08:56.637 --> 08:59.070
Ya need to tell Celestia
the truth, Twilight.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.006
Any other suggestions?

09:01.408 --> 09:03.208
Why don't we just
cancel the show?

09:03.310 --> 09:05.043
REAL suggestions?

09:05.245 --> 09:06.711
No, think about it.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.547
Right now, most of
Equestria doesn't

09:08.649 --> 09:10.716
even know we're doing
a Onesversary play.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.384
If we shut it down...

09:12.486 --> 09:14.386
Nopony will ever miss it!

09:14.688 --> 09:16.788
So they'll never find
out Princess Celestia

09:16.890 --> 09:18.390
is a bad actress.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.525
And she won't be embarrassed.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.260
Ah! It's the
perfect plan!

09:22.362 --> 09:23.429
Rainbow Dash: All right!

09:23.930 --> 09:26.597
I just finished telling
everypony to come to our play!

09:26.700 --> 09:28.233
You...did?

09:28.735 --> 09:29.379
Yeah!

09:29.480 --> 09:31.024
You should've seen how
excited they got

09:31.125 --> 09:32.969
when they found out
Celestia was in it!

09:33.173 --> 09:34.423
They said they'd
tell their friends,

09:34.524 --> 09:36.174
and then their friends'd
tell their friends!

09:36.476 --> 09:39.478
Everypony in Equestria
is gonna see this thing!

09:40.413 --> 09:42.547
Uh, did I miss something?

09:42.849 --> 09:45.383
Just a bright light
of hope being snuffed.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.502
But that's OK.

09:46.603 --> 09:49.520
If we can't cancel the show,
I know what I have to do.

09:49.623 --> 09:53.525
Be honest with Celestia and give
the lead role to somepony else?

09:54.127 --> 09:55.194
Not a chance.

09:55.596 --> 10:00.132
Twilight, you know truth is
a huge part of friendship.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.301
And so is making another
pony's dreams come true!

10:03.503 --> 10:06.204
Look, I promised Celestia
that this time she could

10:06.306 --> 10:09.308
be a part of the play
instead of just watching it.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.743
And I plan to keep
that promise.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.645
But...how?

10:14.915 --> 10:17.849
Celestia: You want to
give me acting lessons?

10:18.051 --> 10:19.368
No no no no no no!

10:19.569 --> 10:22.286
More like, a special
workshop with other actors.

10:22.589 --> 10:26.458
To... take your performance
from good to flawless!

10:27.060 --> 10:29.327
Thank you so much, Twilight!

10:29.429 --> 10:32.263
This is what I always knew
theatre must be about.

10:32.365 --> 10:36.635
That special stage pony bond
of shared trust and honesty.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.172
Yeah. That's
what it is.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.975
Princess Celestia? Meet
Method Mare performers

10:45.078 --> 10:47.746
On Stage and
Raspberry Beret.

10:48.681 --> 10:52.451
Avec pleasure,
Your Majesty.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.120
The pleasure is all mine!

10:55.322 --> 10:57.021
If there's anything
I can do to become

10:57.123 --> 11:00.158
a better Equestrian
thespian, I will!

11:00.660 --> 11:01.893
What do you have planned?

11:02.295 --> 11:06.765
Well, I thought we'd make
it up as we go along. Aha.

11:06.867 --> 11:10.635
Otherwise known as [bad French
accent] "improvisation!"

11:10.737 --> 11:15.440
YES, and we can start as soon
as we get out of this box!

11:18.545 --> 11:20.145
What.. box?

11:23.517 --> 11:25.584
Ooh. How's it going over here?

11:26.186 --> 11:28.720
That sun will
never rise again.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.258
That's why I have
something even better!

11:35.228 --> 11:37.862
Rarity: Oh! It's the
perfect substitute!

11:42.736 --> 11:45.370
It was the perfect substitute.

11:48.491 --> 11:50.874
Please give me something
to be happy about.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.946
Let's try visualization!

11:55.248 --> 11:56.047
And...

11:56.149 --> 11:57.448
you're skiing!

11:57.650 --> 11:59.450
Whoosh, whoosh!

11:59.552 --> 12:01.652
Oh, it's so
snowy today!

12:01.754 --> 12:04.422
Brrr...I'm
getting chilly!

12:04.624 --> 12:06.024
Should I get you a blanket?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.959
All aboard!

12:08.761 --> 12:12.964
The Ponyville Express
is leaving the station!

12:13.066 --> 12:15.066
WOO WOO!

12:15.168 --> 12:16.601
CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA!

12:16.703 --> 12:19.070
It is? I don't
see anything.

12:19.172 --> 12:22.307
Let's be weeping
willows in the wind!

12:22.609 --> 12:28.012
We are strong in adversity,
yet supple as we bow to fate.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.949
Well? What do you feel?

12:32.151 --> 12:32.817
Nothing.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.053
Oh! The classroom floor
under my hooves.

12:35.155 --> 12:35.954
Does that count?

12:37.324 --> 12:38.556
Do I want to know?

12:41.061 --> 12:43.194
Wait for it...

12:46.766 --> 12:48.199
PINKIE PIE!

12:51.104 --> 12:52.804
What? It's realistic!

12:52.906 --> 12:56.007
The sun is just like
a burning marshmallow.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.880
Twilight: What are
they doing now?

13:02.582 --> 13:05.684
[sigh] The simplest acting exercise
they could think of:

13:06.086 --> 13:07.385
A game of Charades.

13:07.687 --> 13:08.553
Actor: A puppy!

13:08.755 --> 13:10.121
A duck-billed platypus!

13:12.092 --> 13:14.125
Antidisestablishmentarianism!

13:14.227 --> 13:16.060
Oh, I give up! What?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.297
My love for Equestria
and all the ponies in it!

13:19.599 --> 13:22.333
Twilight, you felt what I
was emoting, didn't you?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.970
...Yeah!

13:25.172 --> 13:27.572
Now that's the best
acting we've seen all day.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.613
OK. I tried, and
tried, and tried.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.015
But we have to face facts.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.250
We can't make
Celestia an actress.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.985
So there's only one
thing to do.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.221
Tell her the
truth? Finally?

13:43.323 --> 13:44.055
NO!

13:47.260 --> 13:48.993
I've re-written the script
to give Celestia

13:49.095 --> 13:50.761
a more "artistic" part.

13:50.863 --> 13:51.746
With no lines.

13:51.847 --> 13:53.530
And to make sure
the show's a hit,

13:53.733 --> 13:55.700
I've whipped up the
biggest, bestest,

13:55.802 --> 13:58.069
flashiest fake sun EVER!

14:00.841 --> 14:03.808
[groan] Pinkie, that
looks...unsafe.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.611
Why would untested magic
fireworks that I bought in a

14:06.713 --> 14:09.414
back alley from Trixie
at midnight be unsafe?

14:29.902 --> 14:31.936
AAAAH!

14:32.038 --> 14:33.304
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

14:33.406 --> 14:34.739
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE A SIMPLE PLAY!

14:34.841 --> 14:36.107
JUST ONE SIMPLE PLAY!

14:36.209 --> 14:37.426
AND THEN EVERYTHING GOES WRONG!

14:37.527 --> 14:39.244
FROM THE STAGE, TO
THE PROPS, RIGHT DOWN

14:39.346 --> 14:43.181
TO THE WORST LEAD
ACTRESS IN EQUESTRIA!

14:54.761 --> 14:55.745
Twilight.

14:55.846 --> 14:59.830
If you honestly felt I was a bad
actress, why didn't you tell me?

14:59.933 --> 15:01.232
I'm so sorry.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.134
I didn't mean to
insult your acting.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.503
It's just...I got
so stressed.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.074
But that's no excuse
for what I said.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.410
You have every right
to be upset with me.

15:12.812 --> 15:15.613
I'm not upset because
you insulted my acting.

15:15.815 --> 15:16.615
You're not?

15:17.317 --> 15:18.595
I'm upset...

15:18.696 --> 15:20.774
because in all the time
we've known each other,

15:20.875 --> 15:23.853
I thought I'd taught you about
the importance of friendship,

15:23.957 --> 15:25.824
trust, and honesty.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.659
Celestia! Wait!

15:28.761 --> 15:31.095
No! You can't fly away now!

15:31.197 --> 15:31.896
Look!

15:32.198 --> 15:34.649
Ponies are taking their
seats for the show!

15:34.750 --> 15:37.201
Heh heh. Standing
room only!

15:37.403 --> 15:38.836
Did I do a good job
of advertising

15:38.938 --> 15:40.638
for this thing or what?

15:41.507 --> 15:42.057
Sorry.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.708
We can't put on a show
with no lead actress.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.079
You go find Celestia.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.082
We'll figure out a way to stall
this thing till you get back.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.021
Spike: Good luck.

15:56.222 --> 15:59.256
Nopony's gonna volunteer
to try to tame that!

15:59.459 --> 16:02.060
NoPONY indeed.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.399
So... ha ha!

16:07.501 --> 16:10.401
[ahem] Er. Who likes juggling?

16:12.572 --> 16:13.738
Princess Celestia!

16:13.940 --> 16:15.672
Please wait!
Can we talk?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.575
I'm afraid I haven't
much to say, Twilight.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.414
All right then, just listen.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.516
You've guided me
since I was a filly.

16:25.718 --> 16:29.053
You've given me knowledge,
and advice, and friendship.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.006
Just once...

16:31.107 --> 16:33.757
I wanted to be able to
give something back to you.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.328
I know what I did was wrong.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.829
I should've told you the truth.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.065
But I promised you
could be in our play!

16:41.167 --> 16:42.967
I had to make it work.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.137
Nothing would make me feel worse
than knowing I disappointed you.

16:46.539 --> 16:47.938
You really mean that?

16:50.476 --> 16:51.509
Of course!

16:51.711 --> 16:54.545
I look up to you more than
anypony I've ever met.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.614
I'd hate to let you down...

16:57.050 --> 16:57.951
like I did.

16:58.752 --> 17:02.053
[sigh] You had good
intentions, Twilight.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.822
But you know that the
truth is always better

17:04.924 --> 17:06.190
than a well-meant lie.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.426
Didn't Applejack remind you?

17:09.529 --> 17:10.829
About a hundred times.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.598
And now, because I
didn't listen to her,

17:13.800 --> 17:16.000
I've ruined your
whole Onesversary.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.203
Well, I don't
know about that.

17:19.505 --> 17:23.841
Isn't there an old saying,
"The show must go on"?

17:24.143 --> 17:27.311
There may be a way for
us to save the play yet.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.647
But how?

17:28.748 --> 17:31.515
I mean, if I'm being
completely honest...

17:32.385 --> 17:34.118
You're not an actress.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.122
No, but I am a princess.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.891
BOOOO!

17:41.093 --> 17:42.693
Good news, free food.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.347
Bad news?

17:45.448 --> 17:47.565
This play is
officially a disaster.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.468
Fortunately, I know
a thing or two

17:50.570 --> 17:51.970
about how to deal
with those.

17:52.672 --> 17:53.438
You came back!

17:54.240 --> 17:56.274
Yes. But let's celebrate later.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.476
Right now, we have a show to do!

17:59.011 --> 18:00.578
But-but-but how?

18:00.680 --> 18:02.213
The audience is
about to riot!

18:02.315 --> 18:03.447
We have no backdrop!

18:03.549 --> 18:04.849
And our lead actress is...!

18:07.253 --> 18:09.421
No longer in that role.

18:10.123 --> 18:13.624
Rarity, Applejack, Pinkie Pie,
Twilight, go calm the audience.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.993
Let them know the play will
start in just a minute.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.863
Rainbow Dash, bring
us some clouds

18:18.965 --> 18:20.598
and place them
behind the stage.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.107
There. That's our
new backdrop.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.242
Starlight, do you have
a copy of the script?

18:32.545 --> 18:34.679
Spike, you
narrate the play.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.516
Fluttershy will
be our new lead.

18:38.851 --> 18:39.784
Oh, my.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.586
Me? Playing you?

18:41.788 --> 18:44.422
While you watch me playing you?

18:44.524 --> 18:47.091
Oh, no, oh no, I think my
stage fright is coming back.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.595
Visualize with me.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.363
You're a Princess.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.800
Regal, commanding,
confident.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.503
Feel the rising
sun's warmth.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.905
Equestria needs you.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.876
Spike: Once upon a time,
before Celestia,

19:05.978 --> 19:08.947
Equestria was suffering
terrible hardship.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.849
Raising the sun every
morning was so hard

19:12.051 --> 19:14.285
that it took five
Unicorn Sorcerers

19:14.987 --> 19:17.522
plus Starswirl the
Bearded to do it.

19:21.694 --> 19:25.296
You call THOSE
great sorcerers? Ha! Ha!

19:25.498 --> 19:26.964
Oh, no. Hecklers!

19:27.066 --> 19:28.065
What should we do?

19:29.402 --> 19:30.234
Spike!

19:30.336 --> 19:31.569
Improvise!

19:31.771 --> 19:37.576
Yes! And... uh...raising the sun
each day was super-draining.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.378
But you can see that
for yourselves, right?

19:40.480 --> 19:43.481
I mean, do these guys
look beat up or what?

19:43.883 --> 19:47.518
Starswirl's so stressed
he's got kinks in his horn!

19:49.856 --> 19:51.256
But that's OK.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.857
Cause it turns out, Celestia
had the special power

19:53.960 --> 19:56.461
to raise the sun
all by herself!

19:56.763 --> 20:01.131
It's time for a new
day in Equestria!

20:01.233 --> 20:04.168
[music flourish
and then silence]

20:04.270 --> 20:07.505
Agh! In all the commotion, we
forgot we don't have a sun!

20:07.707 --> 20:08.739
What do we do?

20:08.941 --> 20:11.075
We play Charades.

20:12.345 --> 20:18.582
<i> ♪ [majestic music] ♪</i>

20:18.684 --> 20:22.953
Oooh! Aaah!

20:23.055 --> 20:24.722
Wow!

20:29.228 --> 20:30.661
My goodness!

20:30.763 --> 20:32.330
I had no idea this production

20:32.432 --> 20:35.199
would have such elaborate
special effects!

20:39.405 --> 20:41.772
Judging by how many
flowers the audience threw,

20:41.874 --> 20:44.175
it seems our play was a success.

20:44.277 --> 20:47.611
I just feel bad you never got
a chance to actually be in it.

20:47.913 --> 20:48.847
You shouldn't.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.982
I never felt I had to be on
stage to be a part of the show.

20:52.185 --> 20:55.319
All I ever wanted was to share
an honest bond of creativity,

20:55.421 --> 20:57.622
artistry, and happiness
with my friends.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.258
And that's exactly
what I got to do.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.394
Thank you for saving our
play, Princess Celestia.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.363
You're welcome, Twilight.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.231
But from now on, none of you

21:07.333 --> 21:09.934
will have to call me
"Princess" anymore.

21:10.236 --> 21:10.835
Huh?

21:10.937 --> 21:11.635
Wait what?

21:11.737 --> 21:12.488
We don't?

21:13.089 --> 21:15.640
No. I had so much fun
tonight, I've decided

21:15.742 --> 21:18.476
to give up my crown, step
down from the throne,

21:18.578 --> 21:20.911
and devote all of my
time to the theatre!

21:22.114 --> 21:23.948
You...WHAT!?

21:24.417 --> 21:25.150
Gotcha.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.084
Maybe I'm not such a
bad actress, after all.
