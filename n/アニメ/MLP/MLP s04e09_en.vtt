00:10.772 --> 00:11.592
Whatcha doin'?

00:11.600 --> 00:12.048
Aaah!

00:12.146 --> 00:13.363
Aaah, yourself.

00:13.512 --> 00:15.962
But that doesn't answer
my question, silly.

00:16.167 --> 00:18.269
Just some genealogical
research.

00:18.454 --> 00:19.709
Ohhhh.

00:23.239 --> 00:24.704
I don't know
what that is.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.170
Genealogy is the study
of family history.

00:27.340 --> 00:28.913
You know. Where
ponies comes from,

00:28.922 --> 00:30.247
and who they're
related to.

00:30.587 --> 00:32.359
Ooooh. Fascinating.

00:35.301 --> 00:38.265
Maybe you should pick
one from the...top.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.708
Uh-huh.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.510
Interesting.

00:44.512 --> 00:45.778
I see.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.246
That makes sense.

00:47.623 --> 00:49.352
<i>Not much of a surprise there.</i>

00:50.025 --> 00:50.899
<i>WHAT?</i>

00:51.703 --> 00:53.779
THIS IS THE MOST
AMAZING THING EVER!

00:54.444 --> 00:56.960
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
HOW AMAZING THIS IS?

00:57.198 --> 00:59.096
Genealogy is better
than cotton candy

00:59.104 --> 01:01.026
on top of a fountain
of chocolate!

01:02.054 --> 01:04.835
You'll never believe who
it says I'm related to!

01:06.636 --> 01:09.006
Hey, cousin!

01:53.262 --> 01:54.772
I can't hardly
believe it!

01:54.856 --> 01:57.129
I know! Isn't
it the best?

01:57.410 --> 01:59.045
I have another
sister!

01:59.285 --> 02:01.162
I have another
sister!

02:01.424 --> 02:02.950
Well, you actually have
a fourth cousin

02:02.960 --> 02:03.988
<i>twice removed by a</i>
<i>fifth cousin,</i>

02:03.990 --> 02:06.659
<i>but that's like,</i>
<i>exactly like a sister.</i>

02:07.547 --> 02:10.511
I try to tone it down a little
bit around non family members,

02:10.667 --> 02:12.515
because I don't want to
make them jealous, but...

02:12.570 --> 02:15.319
THIS IS THE
BEST FAMILY EVER!

02:16.310 --> 02:17.422
It really is.

02:17.722 --> 02:19.594
You are going to
LOVE being an Apple.

02:19.611 --> 02:21.414
I mean, you've got
the playful one...

02:24.987 --> 02:26.429
The strong one...

02:26.515 --> 02:27.488
EEYUP!

02:30.468 --> 02:32.680
And of course,
there's Granny Smith

02:32.786 --> 02:34.378
<i>who knows everything</i>
<i>about everything.</i>

02:34.610 --> 02:37.962
A Ponyville snail can
hibernate for up to 48 moons.

02:38.493 --> 02:39.935
Who knew?

02:40.277 --> 02:41.843
And then there's me.

02:43.441 --> 02:45.722
You smell that sweet
apple air, Pinkie Pie?

02:46.860 --> 02:47.873
That was rhetorical.

02:47.992 --> 02:50.362
Of course, you smell it.
You're an Apple now.

02:50.579 --> 02:52.692
And Applejack is the
one responsible for it!

02:52.881 --> 02:54.686
Aw, Apple Bloom
that is sweet but--

02:54.696 --> 02:55.535
It's true!

02:55.738 --> 02:58.228
I mean she keeps us all
organized and on schedule

02:58.234 --> 03:00.263
and does her own part
on top if it all!

03:00.341 --> 03:01.428
Mm hm!

03:01.906 --> 03:03.841
I was already super
happy as a Pie.

03:03.990 --> 03:06.577
And now I get to be a part
of this amazing family too?

03:06.864 --> 03:09.075
It's even more amazing
now that you're in it!

03:09.410 --> 03:11.055

03:13.763 --> 03:17.092
BEST FAMILY TWIRL EVER!

03:20.347 --> 03:22.085
I just can't believe we
never heard anything

03:22.095 --> 03:23.108
about this before.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.440
Hmmm.

03:24.452 --> 03:25.568
What's wrong, sis?

03:25.869 --> 03:28.796
I'm not seein' where exactly
it says we're family.

03:28.860 --> 03:31.722
It's riiiiiiiiiiiight....

03:31.738 --> 03:35.870
riiiiiiiiiiiight...here!

03:36.300 --> 03:37.623
It is?

03:37.800 --> 03:38.388
Uh-huh.

03:38.647 --> 03:41.609
Applesauce of the Apple family
lineage is a fourth cousin

03:41.613 --> 03:43.492
twice removed of the Pie family.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.415
I see the part about our Great,
Great Auntie Applesauce

03:46.421 --> 03:48.150
and fourth cousin
twice removed part,

03:48.161 --> 03:50.499
but that last bit's
awful smudged.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.755
Are you sure it says "Pie"?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.670
I guess it is a
little smudged.

03:55.773 --> 03:56.837
But I see most of it there,

03:56.942 --> 04:00.163
and when I read it, I knew
in my heart it was true.

04:01.375 --> 04:04.887
Well, ain't that just
the sweetest thing.

04:05.155 --> 04:06.312
It is, it is.

04:06.526 --> 04:08.478
I'd just hate for us
to get all excited

04:08.480 --> 04:09.968
before we found
out for sure.

04:10.355 --> 04:13.268
So how are we supposed
to find out for sure?

04:15.843 --> 04:17.840
Cousin Goldie Delicious!

04:18.085 --> 04:21.465
Her cabin's practically an
Apple family history museum.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.569
If anypony has the records
to back up Pinkie's theory,

04:24.575 --> 04:25.687
it's her!

04:26.306 --> 04:27.605
I suppose we could always...

04:27.847 --> 04:30.558
I mean Goldie Delicious doesn't
live all that far away...

04:30.692 --> 04:34.191
<i>And we haven't been on one as</i>
<i>a family in a real long time...</i>

04:37.188 --> 04:39.250
Are y'all thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

04:40.513 --> 04:42.503
FAMILY ROAD TRIP!

04:46.520 --> 04:48.979
Has anypony seen my
travelin' bonnet?

04:49.365 --> 04:50.764
Isn't that it on your head?

04:51.715 --> 04:52.376
No.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.182
It looks an
awful lot like--

04:55.190 --> 04:55.896
Well, it's ain't.

04:55.902 --> 04:57.443
And that's final.

04:57.633 --> 04:58.489
Hey everypony?

04:58.862 --> 05:01.281
Since Pinkie Pie is back home
gettin' her stuff for the trip,

05:01.660 --> 05:02.544
can y'all gather round?

05:02.702 --> 05:04.343
I just wanted to say
something real quick.

05:04.815 --> 05:08.037
I've had somethin' in my teeth
this whole time, haven't I?

05:08.435 --> 05:11.067
Gadsnickety, what a way to
welcome a family member!

05:11.555 --> 05:14.768
Uh, no, Granny, your
teeth are fine.

05:15.213 --> 05:17.656
I just wanted to be sure that
we're all on the same page

05:17.660 --> 05:21.348
about showin' Pinkie Pie how
awesome a family we really are.

05:21.527 --> 05:24.304
We want her to get to know the
family she's been born into!

05:24.540 --> 05:27.291
But like, the best
version of it, you know?

05:27.865 --> 05:30.636
Oh! Don't you worry, honey!

05:30.725 --> 05:33.888
We're a great family and
she can't help but see it.

05:34.312 --> 05:36.850
I bet my future cutie mark's
gonna be a picture of me

05:36.864 --> 05:39.041
being the best
behaved pony ever.

05:39.562 --> 05:40.830
That's how good
I'm gonna be!

05:41.205 --> 05:41.746
<i>Big Mac?</i>

05:42.524 --> 05:43.496
Eeyup!

05:43.680 --> 05:44.657
<i>Are you all</i>
<i>ready to go?</i>

05:44.712 --> 05:46.511
Because I'm ready
to go go go!

05:49.621 --> 05:53.734
Uh, Big Mac, are you sure we
really need all that stuff?

05:54.774 --> 05:55.898
Eeyup.

05:56.429 --> 05:57.959
Are you sure you're
strong enough

05:57.962 --> 05:59.480
to really pull
all that stuff?

05:59.955 --> 06:01.067
Eeyup!

06:01.272 --> 06:04.029
Are you sure the wagon's
strong enough to hold it all?

06:05.283 --> 06:06.212
Eeyup.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.999
Then let's get this

I thought you said--

08:32.751 --> 08:36.624
I thought, I mean, not
that I'm blaming you,

08:36.630 --> 08:38.915
because we don't blame
in this family,

08:39.114 --> 08:41.441
but I thought you
said all this stuff

08:41.451 --> 08:43.309
wasn't gonna be too heavy.

08:44.552 --> 08:47.307
How are we supposed to get
to Goldie Delicious now?

08:47.687 --> 08:51.758
I don't know, but I don't see
how we can go back now either.

08:52.025 --> 08:54.733
We're closer to cousin
Goldie's than we are to home.

08:55.586 --> 08:56.786
I have the best...

08:57.049 --> 08:57.711
idea...

08:57.849 --> 08:58.817
ever!

08:58.926 --> 09:00.944
FAMILY RIVER TRIP!

09:02.236 --> 09:04.282
Ha. Just one problem.

09:04.507 --> 09:05.945
We haven't got a raft.

09:06.078 --> 09:07.988
About the only thing
that didn't get packed.

09:09.242 --> 09:11.121
Well, back in the old days

09:11.135 --> 09:13.283
we used to use the sap
from a sugar pine tree

09:13.291 --> 09:14.827
to glue things together.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.038
That is, uh, fascinatin'.

09:17.434 --> 09:20.111
Don't know that it's helpful,
but it is fascinatin'.

09:21.235 --> 09:22.835
Not helpful, my patooty!

09:22.881 --> 09:24.643
We're gonna build
ourselves a raft

09:24.655 --> 09:26.212
outta these here jalopy parts

09:26.485 --> 09:29.465
and keep it held together
with sugar pine sap.

09:29.666 --> 09:31.268
Hm. Worth a shot.

09:31.391 --> 09:32.269
Whoo hoo!

09:36.320 --> 09:37.912
Could be worse. I guess.

09:38.232 --> 09:42.247
Now remember, this time we're
only packin' the necessities.

09:42.788 --> 09:43.617
<i>Wait a second!</i>

09:45.843 --> 09:47.916
This one is for
the scrapbook.

09:50.302 --> 09:52.778
Pinkie Pie, when did
<i>you have time to make this?</i>

09:54.967 --> 09:58.700
Applejack, when you're
family, you make the time.

10:02.575 --> 10:03.617
Woo-hoo!

10:03.754 --> 10:04.960
We did it!

10:05.328 --> 10:07.717
Say "Soaked!"

10:13.910 --> 10:18.343
So what you're saying is, if
I have the courage to jump,

10:18.706 --> 10:20.917
the parachute will open.

10:21.026 --> 10:21.814
Eeyup!

10:22.111 --> 10:24.688
Whoa! That is deep.

10:24.922 --> 10:25.607
Eeyup.

10:27.504 --> 10:29.020
Uh-oh.

10:29.389 --> 10:30.339
All right, y'all.

10:30.567 --> 10:32.218
Please tell me that the
map didn't get wet.

10:32.505 --> 10:34.675
<i>'Cause it looks like I'm</i>
<i>gonna need it right about now.</i>

10:38.632 --> 10:39.330
Found it!

10:39.590 --> 10:41.477
<i>♪ Who's got the map?</i>
<i>I got the map. ♪</i>

10:41.775 --> 10:43.820

I'm Apple-- Uh-oh.

10:49.414 --> 10:50.228
Oh!

10:57.032 --> 10:58.792
All you had to do
was bring it to me.

10:59.051 --> 11:01.475
No singin', no
dancin', no games.

11:01.613 --> 11:02.796
Just walk it over.

11:02.991 --> 11:03.964
Eeyup.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.273
Say, "Best siblings ever!"

11:08.093 --> 11:09.506
That's another keeper!

11:09.674 --> 11:11.278
<i>It's OK, y'all!</i>

11:11.348 --> 11:13.274
I traveled down this
river as a filly

11:13.309 --> 11:15.385
and I know it like
the back of my hoof!

11:17.738 --> 11:19.432
Are you sure you
know which way to go?

11:19.660 --> 11:21.615
Does a june bug like
to hide in a tree?

11:21.984 --> 11:23.482
Uh... I don't know.

11:23.779 --> 11:25.361
Well, I do know.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.479
<i>And I also know we</i>
<i>wanna head Southeast.</i>

11:27.693 --> 11:29.180
Now step aside, young 'un.

11:32.954 --> 11:34.052
Um, Granny?

11:34.323 --> 11:35.301
Uh huh?

11:35.430 --> 11:37.457
<i>Are we supposed to</i>
<i>go through a cave?</i>

11:38.171 --> 11:39.297
Don't worry, child.

11:39.496 --> 11:42.345
The scariest cave in Equestria
was down that other way.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.799
The scariest cave
in Equestria?

11:46.316 --> 11:47.631
Oh, it's a fright
all right.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.323
Filled with creatures that'll
eat ya soon as look at ya.

11:50.725 --> 11:52.811
Oooh! Sounds scary.

11:53.309 --> 11:54.120
Tell us more.

11:54.534 --> 11:56.111
<i>Ponies go in.</i>

11:56.197 --> 11:58.154
<i>But they never come out.</i>

12:02.033 --> 12:03.886
And you're sure
it's not that cave?

12:04.218 --> 12:05.693
The one we're
headin' straight for?

12:05.972 --> 12:08.066
Now Applejack, I
taught you better

12:08.070 --> 12:10.314
than to question
your elder ponies.

12:12.540 --> 12:13.880
You sure did.

12:14.058 --> 12:15.557
All righty, then.

12:15.834 --> 12:18.924
Now everypony just sit on back
and leave the steerin'

12:18.930 --> 12:20.682
to your old Granny Smith.

12:27.806 --> 12:29.775
<i>See now. Told you</i>
<i>this was--</i>

12:32.928 --> 12:34.271
<i>Got it!</i>

12:36.210 --> 12:38.483
<i>Best scary unidentifiable</i>
<i>creature ever.</i>

12:40.257 --> 12:42.282
<i>Say "Terrified!"</i>

12:49.471 --> 12:52.608
Guess that was the scariest
cave in Equestria.

12:55.055 --> 12:57.123
Of course, I meant to
take us through it.

12:57.373 --> 12:59.363
Unexpected adventure
is good for the soul!

12:59.678 --> 13:01.484
Best Granny
wisdom ever!

13:01.697 --> 13:02.382
Uh-huh.

13:02.784 --> 13:05.297
Why don't you just scooch
on over there, Granny?

13:05.615 --> 13:07.539
Think I'll take it
from here on out.

13:08.653 --> 13:11.781
Is that how I taught you
to treat your elder ponies?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.890
Oooh. Oooh. Is it?

13:14.745 --> 13:17.393
You taught me to
trust my common sense.

13:17.568 --> 13:18.942
And my common sense says

13:19.102 --> 13:22.171
we should get to Goldie
Delicious' cabin in one piece!

13:22.386 --> 13:25.219
And that is exactly
what I'm gonna do!

13:25.473 --> 13:27.404
That is mighty
generous of you,

13:27.416 --> 13:29.840
but I think you've done
enough for one day.

13:30.066 --> 13:33.315
And how exactly are you
gonna know which way to go?

13:33.615 --> 13:35.781
Hmmmmm?

13:36.507 --> 13:40.035
It would be easier if the
map hadn't gone overboard.

13:40.386 --> 13:43.043
Hey! There wouldn't have
been an overboard

13:43.053 --> 13:45.180
if Big Mac hadn't
overpacked the jalopy.

13:45.863 --> 13:47.285
Eeyup. Hey!

13:47.660 --> 13:48.883
Exactly.

13:49.223 --> 13:52.374
So I think we can all agree
that from here on out,

13:52.577 --> 13:54.626
I should be in
charge of everything.

14:11.539 --> 14:12.405
Heh heh.

14:14.234 --> 14:18.132
I just want to say that I think
you are all super-duper

14:18.298 --> 14:19.980
and I can't wait to make
the page in my scrapbook

14:19.992 --> 14:22.208
about the amazing
waterfall we went down.

14:41.512 --> 14:45.607
<i>Wheeeee!</i>

14:58.622 --> 15:01.644
Told ya that sugar pine sap
would hold this thing together.

15:14.721 --> 15:15.783
We're here! We're here!

15:15.795 --> 15:17.955
We made it to
Goldie Delicious'!

15:19.055 --> 15:21.900
You guys! There's a note!

15:27.719 --> 15:29.235
Uh, Pinkie Pie?

15:29.467 --> 15:31.467
Maybe you could read
that one out loud?

15:31.691 --> 15:33.726
Oh right, sorry! I
haven't even read it yet,

15:33.734 --> 15:35.744
I was just looking at
how pretty the paper is.

15:36.150 --> 15:38.599
OK! It says that she ran
off to run some errands

15:38.602 --> 15:39.728
but will be home soon.

15:39.986 --> 15:41.600
Ah! That's perfect!

15:41.972 --> 15:43.804
Why is that perfect?

15:44.003 --> 15:45.763
Because it will
give me enough time

15:45.773 --> 15:47.159
to get more
scrapbook paper!

15:47.562 --> 15:48.405
See ya!

15:49.693 --> 15:52.511
Worst family road
trip. Ever.

15:52.739 --> 15:54.040
Eeyup.

15:54.085 --> 15:56.171
I can't believe she
witnessed our family

15:56.181 --> 15:57.814
falling apart like this.

15:58.862 --> 16:01.240
I can't believe I was
arguing with you so much

16:01.496 --> 16:03.740
that I tore the
wheel right off the raft.

16:04.113 --> 16:06.007
It's like I wasn't
myself at all.

16:06.345 --> 16:08.612
Aw, that wasn't
your fault.

16:08.864 --> 16:11.557
My stubborn streak got a
holda me somethin' fierce.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.505
I shoulda let you take the
wheel long before that.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.047
It was my fault the
map got all wet.

16:17.383 --> 16:18.333
I was the pony..

16:18.341 --> 16:21.691
Now now, Big Mac, you
gotta know we forgive you

16:21.701 --> 16:24.214
for packin' the jalopy so
much that it collapsed.

16:24.429 --> 16:28.347
You was just eager to please
Pinkie Pie like the rest of us.

16:28.983 --> 16:31.717
Everypony, I think we have
to let Pinkie Pie know

16:31.722 --> 16:34.085
that even if she does
discover that she's an Apple,

16:34.384 --> 16:37.313
she does not have to feel
obliged to consider herself one.

16:37.670 --> 16:39.525
Sure as apple sauce.

16:39.802 --> 16:41.650
<i>ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</i>

16:41.955 --> 16:44.944
You guys are the
best family ever!

16:45.077 --> 16:46.448
How can you say that?

16:46.749 --> 16:50.277
We started out as one big
unit and now look at us.

16:50.464 --> 16:52.284
Yeah! NOW look at you!

16:52.292 --> 16:54.448
You're all here still
in one big unit,

16:54.856 --> 16:57.145
<i>loving each other and owning</i>
<i>up to what went wrong!</i>

16:57.369 --> 17:00.021
You never gave up, even
when things got tough!

17:00.423 --> 17:02.380
She does make a
pretty good point.

17:02.612 --> 17:05.678
You aren't just family,
you're best friends!

17:06.671 --> 17:08.413
And I want to be an
Apple more than ever!

17:08.593 --> 17:10.472
And we want you
to be one too!

17:10.694 --> 17:12.651
Yippee! Hee hee hee!

17:13.008 --> 17:15.428
<i>Now that's how</i>
<i>you run an errand.</i>

17:16.234 --> 17:17.998
HELLLLLO!

17:18.392 --> 17:20.343
Hello, yourself.

17:20.448 --> 17:23.168
You must be Goldie Delicious;
so nice to meet you!

17:23.445 --> 17:25.730
And who exactly are you?

17:26.191 --> 17:27.943
We're Apples!

17:28.491 --> 17:30.323
Well, we think
we're all Apples.

17:30.495 --> 17:32.803
But we need your help findin'
out if Pinkie Pie here

17:32.815 --> 17:34.476
is our fourth cousin
twice removed.

17:35.032 --> 17:36.729
Why didn't you say so?

17:36.940 --> 17:40.993
If anypony can help solve this
genealogy mystery, it's me.

17:46.706 --> 17:48.550
I am sorry about this.

17:49.492 --> 17:51.551
I wasn't exactly
expectin' company.

17:51.869 --> 17:53.506
Let me try to
squeeze in here.

17:55.906 --> 17:59.871
Get some oil ... the
hinges, heh heh heh.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.496
All right then!

18:01.610 --> 18:04.524
Just have to move a few things
out of the way of the door.

18:04.534 --> 18:07.024
Ooh! Ah! Get off of
that, Mr. Puppy.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.446
<i>Come on, sweetheart.</i>

18:11.291 --> 18:12.963
Come on in!

18:15.557 --> 18:16.938
Sorry about the mess.

18:26.803 --> 18:27.479
Whoa!

18:27.560 --> 18:28.481
Careful now.

18:28.542 --> 18:32.257
Those belonged to your Great,
Great, Great, Uncle Apple Tart.

18:32.751 --> 18:33.732
Whose was this?

18:34.119 --> 18:35.237
<i>That was my lunch.</i>

18:35.415 --> 18:36.747
<i>A couple weeks ago.</i>

18:47.707 --> 18:51.900
And this here is the complete
record of our family tree.

18:54.382 --> 18:58.565
It's not here, or here or here,
it certainly isn't here, is it.

18:58.967 --> 18:59.740
Oh, here it is!

19:00.364 --> 19:01.141
Oh dear.

19:01.426 --> 19:02.786
"Oh dear"? What is it?

19:03.414 --> 19:04.934
Am I not an
Apple after all?

19:05.278 --> 19:07.164
That's just it.
I don't know!

19:07.258 --> 19:08.856
The page is all smudged!

19:12.126 --> 19:15.299
I sure am sorry, but I don't
think I can help you after all.

19:15.863 --> 19:16.753
Don't be sorry.

19:17.024 --> 19:17.943
It's OK.

19:18.292 --> 19:20.731
I'm just a little disappointed
that I'll never know for sure

19:20.743 --> 19:22.347
if I'm a part of this family.

19:23.658 --> 19:25.194
Well, I know for sure!

19:25.385 --> 19:26.423
What do you mean?

19:26.544 --> 19:27.693
You can't know.

19:28.175 --> 19:30.234
I can know for sure
that it doesn't matter

19:30.241 --> 19:32.749
what the book says
or doesn't say.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.634
After all you've
been through with us,

19:34.926 --> 19:36.111
and all you've put up with,

19:36.509 --> 19:39.818
it's obvious you're
an Apple to the core!

19:40.167 --> 19:41.303
Darn tootin'!

19:41.642 --> 19:42.801
Yes-siree!

19:43.264 --> 19:44.540
Eeyup!

19:48.782 --> 19:51.084
Say "Best family hug ever!"

19:51.422 --> 19:53.633
Best family hug ever!

20:03.203 --> 20:04.706
Thanks again for
the wagon, Goldie!

20:05.061 --> 20:06.060
See you soon!

20:06.270 --> 20:08.413
Y'all sure you don't want
to take any of these

20:08.423 --> 20:10.400
Apple family heirlooms
home with ya?

20:15.303 --> 20:16.396
Nnope.

20:21.252 --> 20:25.006
<i>♪ We're Apples forever</i>
<i>Apples together ♪</i>

20:25.246 --> 20:29.010
<i>♪ We're family but</i>
<i>so much more. ♪</i>

20:29.256 --> 20:33.034
<i>♪ No matter what comes</i>
<i>We will face the weather. ♪</i>

20:33.209 --> 20:36.973
<i>♪ We're Apples to the core! </i>

20:40.152 --> 20:42.444
Twilight agreed this was
definitely an experience

20:42.452 --> 20:43.525
worth puttin' in the journal.

20:43.947 --> 20:46.095
Think I'll write about
how bein' a good family

20:46.247 --> 20:47.691
isn't about bein' perfect

20:47.709 --> 20:49.927
as much as it is about
bein' able to get through

20:49.931 --> 20:51.120
the rough patches together.

20:51.654 --> 20:53.984
About bein' able to forgive
each other for mistakes.

20:54.364 --> 20:56.280
Don't forget to mention how
really good friends

20:56.292 --> 20:57.779
can also feel like
your family.

20:58.033 --> 20:58.926
Eeyup.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.000
You know what?

21:01.250 --> 21:02.456
Maybe I should write it.

21:02.591 --> 21:04.565
I'm good at makin'
things sound excitin'.

21:04.893 --> 21:07.562
I have a history of
excellent story telling.

21:07.711 --> 21:09.432
I should probably
do it-- Hey!

21:09.592 --> 21:11.769
Where in the haystack do
you think you're going

21:11.775 --> 21:12.952
with that there pen?

21:17.354 --> 21:20.975
Look at me; I'm part of the
Apply family too. I'm arguing!

21:20.980 --> 21:23.611
<i>Argue-argue-argue!</i>
<i>Bicker, bicker!</i>
