WEBVTT

00:02.925 --> 00:05.872
I made it for you, Rarity.

00:06.375 --> 00:09.703
Why yes, it is an ice cream house.

00:10.175 --> 00:14.375
Chocolate fudge shingles...
Rocky road garage...

00:20.875 --> 00:22.051
Twilight?

00:22.202 --> 00:23.375
Oh, hi Spike.

00:23.975 --> 00:26.775
It's the middle of the night!
Why are you pacing like this?

00:26.926 --> 00:29.739
Frankly, I don't know how you
can sleep at a time like this!

00:30.025 --> 00:31.490
Three AM?

00:31.941 --> 00:34.975
It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!

00:35.825 --> 00:38.275
I don't understand.
What's wrong?

00:38.465 --> 00:40.875
Here.
Now do you see what's wrong?

00:41.805 --> 00:44.229
You forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?

00:44.380 --> 00:48.008
No, the problem is I just finished
planning my schedule for the month,

00:48.159 --> 00:50.858
but I forgot to leave time to plan
for next month!

00:51.315 --> 00:52.275
Don't you see?

00:52.426 --> 00:54.985
There's no time in my schedule
to put together another schedule!

00:55.175 --> 00:57.000
I could move my meeting with
the Ponyville Hay Board

00:57.151 --> 00:58.175
to the following Tuesday,

00:58.355 --> 01:00.625
but then I have to reschedule
my lunch with Pinkie Pie.

01:00.776 --> 01:02.745
And you know what a nightmare
she is with scheduling.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.593
This is an absolute disaster.
My whole year could be thrown off!

01:06.735 --> 01:09.575
And I woke up from
an ice cream dream for this...

01:11.885 --> 01:16.514
Season 2 | Episode 20
It's About Time

01:18.275 --> 01:22.300

http://grayjeager.blogspot.com

01:52.853 --> 01:54.703
Oh my gosh, I think I did it!

01:54.854 --> 01:57.533
If I can find a way to read
The Art of Invisibility Spells,

01:57.684 --> 02:00.496
and Farmhill's A Brief History of Canterlot
at the same time,

02:00.647 --> 02:03.061
that could leave me
a half-hour scheduling window!

02:08.625 --> 02:10.288
What's going on?

02:28.650 --> 02:29.575
Twilight,

02:29.826 --> 02:30.975
you've got to listen to me!

02:31.125 --> 02:31.877
Who are you?

02:32.025 --> 02:34.225
I mean, you're me, but I'm me too.

02:34.375 --> 02:35.555
How can there be two 'me's?

02:35.706 --> 02:36.875
It's not scientifically possible.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.933
You are not scientifically possible!

02:39.075 --> 02:39.655
Twilight, please!

02:39.805 --> 02:42.378
I have a very important message
for you from the future!

02:42.529 --> 02:44.345
You're from the future?!

02:44.496 --> 02:45.646
That's right, now listen-

02:45.797 --> 02:48.995
What happened to you?
The future must be awful.

02:49.146 --> 02:50.775
Please! I don't have much time!

02:50.926 --> 02:53.775
Is there some sort of epic pony war
in the distant future or something?

02:53.876 --> 02:56.775
Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning.
But that's not important right now!

02:56.925 --> 02:59.701
I can't believe
time travel's really possible!

02:59.852 --> 03:02.511
How did you, I mean, I
figure it out?

03:02.662 --> 03:04.625
The time spells are in
the Canterlot archives.

03:04.775 --> 03:06.225
- But that's not-
- Really? Where?

03:06.375 --> 03:07.266
I've never seen them.

03:07.417 --> 03:09.314
They're in the
Star Swirl the Bearded wing.

03:09.455 --> 03:12.375
- Now, you have to listen to me.
- Is time travel fun, or does it hurt?

03:12.526 --> 03:13.876
I have so many questions-

03:14.195 --> 03:17.426
I have something extremely important
to tell you about the future.

03:17.577 --> 03:19.892
I only have a few seconds,
so you've got to listen!

03:20.043 --> 03:21.425
Whatever you do, don't-

03:23.103 --> 03:25.303
Future Twilight? Oh no!

03:25.454 --> 03:27.214
What was she trying to warn me about?

03:27.365 --> 03:30.317
Her clothes, her mane, that scar...

03:30.468 --> 03:31.980
What a mess she is!

03:32.131 --> 03:35.143
I mean, I am... or I... will be...

03:36.063 --> 03:39.453
She must want me to prevent whatever
horrible thing happens in the future!

03:42.323 --> 03:47.003
C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start
until the party supplies get there!

03:47.904 --> 03:51.273
Happy to... help... but...

03:51.523 --> 03:54.848
Can I carry... the balloons next time?

03:58.614 --> 04:02.103
Listen, everypony! I've got
something really important to say!

04:07.253 --> 04:10.753
This is no laughing matter!
We have a crisis on our hooves!

04:12.303 --> 04:14.883
I've just been visited
by myself from the future!

04:19.253 --> 04:20.479
This isn't a joke!

04:20.630 --> 04:23.348
My future self tried to warn me
about a horrible disaster,

04:23.499 --> 04:26.173
that's gonna occur sometime
before next Tuesday morning!

04:26.324 --> 04:27.473
What kind of disaster?

04:27.624 --> 04:28.603
I don't know!

04:28.754 --> 04:31.443
I got sucked back into the future
before I could explain!

04:31.594 --> 04:35.162
Run for your liiife!

04:35.683 --> 04:37.583
Whatever should we do, Twilight?

04:37.734 --> 04:40.779
How do we stop a disaster
if we don't know what it is?

04:40.930 --> 04:43.483
We'll just have to work together
to make sure we're safe.

04:43.634 --> 04:47.683
Rainbow Dash, you and the other pegasi
spread out over Equestria

04:47.834 --> 04:50.403
and look for any kind of problem
that could lead to a disaster.

04:50.554 --> 04:52.333
And I mean anything.

04:52.484 --> 04:53.503
You got it!

04:54.513 --> 04:55.453
Everypony else...

04:59.473 --> 05:01.710
Anypony else wanna panic with me?

05:01.903 --> 05:02.861
No?

05:05.323 --> 05:09.422
Everypony else,
time to disaster proof Equestria!

05:34.655 --> 05:35.846
Eeyup.

05:53.023 --> 05:55.439
Done, and done, and done.

05:55.651 --> 05:57.963
Applejack,
what about the Everfree Forest?

05:58.114 --> 05:59.114
The perimeter's clear.

05:59.265 --> 06:00.065
Great.

06:00.216 --> 06:03.869
And my team gave the all clear
from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.

06:03.970 --> 06:04.903
Excellent.

06:05.054 --> 06:07.560
Well, we've done everything on the list.

06:07.711 --> 06:09.303
But still...

06:09.462 --> 06:12.773
Future Twilight looked like
she'd been through a horrible ordeal.

06:12.924 --> 06:15.853
I just have this nagging feeling
we should be looking for something bigger

06:16.004 --> 06:18.008
than loose bolts and leaky pipes.

06:24.503 --> 06:27.753
Okay, everypony.
Follow my lead.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.352
- What is that thing?
- That's Cerberus!

06:37.503 --> 06:39.953
He's supposed to be guarding
the gates of Tartarus.

06:40.104 --> 06:43.353
But if he's here, then all the ancient evil
creatures that have been imprisoned there

06:43.504 --> 06:45.433
could escape and destroy Equestria!

06:45.584 --> 06:48.623
- Destroy Equestria?!
- Yeah, isn't it great?

06:48.774 --> 06:52.773
Hey, Cerberus! You look like
you could use some obedience training!

06:53.124 --> 06:55.089
Magic obedience training!

07:00.073 --> 07:03.363
Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?

07:03.514 --> 07:07.203
Wow, I knew you were good with animals,
but this is amazing.

07:07.354 --> 07:12.108
Aw, he's just a big furry guy
who got out of his yard, that's all.

07:12.259 --> 07:13.259
Right, Cerberus?

07:13.410 --> 07:16.453
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

07:18.803 --> 07:20.703
- Pinkie.
- Yes, Twilight?

07:20.854 --> 07:22.174
Do you have a ball I can borrow?

07:22.525 --> 07:26.203
I have balls stashed all over Ponyville.
In case of ball emergency.

07:27.053 --> 07:28.673
Hey, Cerberus!

07:30.353 --> 07:32.553
Look what I have!

07:33.103 --> 07:35.983
I'll be back as soon as I've returned him
to the gates of Tartarus.

07:36.134 --> 07:38.753
Once he's back at home,
there'll be no disaster.

07:47.183 --> 07:50.958
I wish Twilight would go on
epic adventures more often.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.753
Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.

07:55.723 --> 07:57.763
Hey Twilight.
How'd it go with Cerberus?

07:57.953 --> 08:02.303
Great! I got him back before any
of the evil creatures could escape.

08:05.763 --> 08:06.760
Oh no!

08:07.253 --> 08:10.223
What's the big deal,
it's just a 'lost dog' flyer.

08:10.374 --> 08:12.853
I guess the Princess hasn't heard
we found Cerberus yet.

08:13.004 --> 08:15.564
It's not that,
it's this!

08:15.933 --> 08:17.453
A paper cut...?

08:17.604 --> 08:19.853
Come on, Twilight,
you really need to toughen up.

08:20.154 --> 08:22.432
Just clean it out and you'll be fine.

08:22.833 --> 08:26.603
The cut's in the exact same spot
as the scar on future Twilight's cheek!

08:26.754 --> 08:28.764
We haven't changed the future at all!

08:28.915 --> 08:30.976
The disaster is still coming!

08:33.156 --> 08:36.059
If the disaster wasn't caused
by Cerberus getting loose,

08:36.210 --> 08:37.756
then what could it possibly be?

08:39.236 --> 08:42.576
I dunno, but maybe you ought
to give the pacing a rest.

08:42.727 --> 08:44.356
You've worn a groove into the floor!

08:44.507 --> 08:46.706
I don't have time for another one
of your lectures, Spike!

08:46.857 --> 08:47.857
This is serious!

08:48.008 --> 08:49.556
My lectures?

08:49.707 --> 08:52.506
I did everything I could think of
to change the future.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.557
But it didn't work.

08:54.308 --> 08:56.756
So maybe it's not what I do...

08:56.907 --> 08:59.106
Maybe it's what I don't do!

09:01.886 --> 09:04.856
If I stand right here and don't
move a muscle until next Tuesday,

09:05.007 --> 09:06.226
I can't possibly do whatever it is

09:06.377 --> 09:08.656
that future Twilight wanted
to warn me not to do!

09:10.016 --> 09:11.606
Really?

09:11.907 --> 09:16.656
So... no matter what happens,
you're not gonna move a muscle, huh?

09:16.856 --> 09:20.056
Then maybe you won't mind if I...

09:20.507 --> 09:22.286
eat an entire tub of ice cream!

09:34.406 --> 09:35.845
So good!

09:37.006 --> 09:40.156
Spike, stop!
Think of the stomach ache!

09:40.957 --> 09:42.506
Stomach ache, huh?

09:42.657 --> 09:44.670
That's future Spike's problem.

09:48.456 --> 09:49.456
Hey, Twilight!

09:49.607 --> 09:52.406
Another pegasus just got back
from Baltimare with an all-clear and-

09:55.156 --> 09:58.056
What's going on?
Aren't you gonna stop him?

09:58.207 --> 09:59.176
She sure isn't!

09:59.327 --> 10:01.656
In fact, she's not gonna move
'til next Tuesday!

10:01.856 --> 10:04.806
She thinks it'll prevent
the disaster from happening!

10:05.656 --> 10:07.828
Oh, this is too rich.

10:08.606 --> 10:11.106
Hey Twilight!
There's a mouse right behind you!

10:17.779 --> 10:19.656
Wait, wait, wait, let me try!

10:30.406 --> 10:32.131
Oh no!

10:32.282 --> 10:33.382
What happened?

10:33.533 --> 10:38.436
I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to!
It was a total accident!

10:38.636 --> 10:39.616
Show me.

10:40.817 --> 10:42.417
I'm not so sure that's a-

10:42.568 --> 10:43.306
Show me!

10:46.306 --> 10:49.906
Oh no! This is the same
mane cut as future Twilight!

10:50.586 --> 10:54.006
Y'know...
It really doesn't look too bad...

10:54.157 --> 10:55.687
I don't care how it looks!

10:55.838 --> 10:58.326
It's just another sign
that the future hasn't changed!

10:58.477 --> 11:01.067
Not doing anything didn't work either!

11:01.318 --> 11:04.806
I wish there was a way to know what
was going to happen so I could stop it!

11:05.166 --> 11:06.778
You wanna see the future?

11:07.856 --> 11:10.706
I might know somepony who can help!

11:11.706 --> 11:12.636
What's this?

11:12.787 --> 11:14.056
It's Madame Pinkie's place.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.656
Madame Pinkie?

11:16.713 --> 11:22.456
Come... enter the chamber
of Madame Pinkie Pie...

11:22.607 --> 11:30.356
For the answers you seek, let us consult
the mystical orb of fate's destiny...

11:31.107 --> 11:33.186
Do you like
my mystical orb of fate's destiny?

11:33.337 --> 11:35.451
I just got it. Cool, huh?

11:35.602 --> 11:38.536
Yeah, uh... best one I've seen.

11:38.687 --> 11:45.036
Look deep into the crystal ball...
For soon it will reveal all!

11:45.187 --> 11:48.056
Ah yes, I see something...

11:48.507 --> 11:51.656
It's a vision of the future...

11:51.807 --> 11:54.656
I see you, Twilight.

11:54.807 --> 11:56.406
You will get...

11:56.556 --> 12:00.389
a really cool birthday present next year!

12:00.540 --> 12:01.636
Yes, and?

12:01.806 --> 12:02.906
That's it.

12:03.216 --> 12:04.357
Are you sure?

12:04.508 --> 12:06.316
Yep. Cool birthday present.

12:06.567 --> 12:09.416
Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense
to tell me what the impending

12:09.567 --> 12:12.101
disaster is that future Twilight
was trying to warn me about!

12:12.252 --> 12:16.156
Oh, my fortune telling has nothing to do
with my Pinkie Sense, silly.

12:16.307 --> 12:18.754
It's only good for vague
and immediate events.

12:20.676 --> 12:22.336
Like that, see?

12:22.487 --> 12:24.454
Where did that even come from?

12:29.806 --> 12:32.556
Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight
since the flowerpot incident.

12:32.707 --> 12:34.007
Hope she still isn't mad.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.220
Off by point zero two from yesterday.

12:41.571 --> 12:42.641
Carry the fifteen...

12:42.992 --> 12:45.056
Negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...

12:45.207 --> 12:46.207
Hey Pinkie.

12:46.358 --> 12:48.223
Twilight's really serious about finding out

12:48.374 --> 12:50.606
about that cool birthday present, isn't she?

12:51.006 --> 12:54.092
Who cares?
As long as I can keep eating ice cream.

12:54.243 --> 12:55.643
Sorry, future Spike.

12:58.216 --> 12:59.838
Are you okay?

13:00.089 --> 13:02.466
Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here.

13:02.617 --> 13:04.212
Can you help me recalibrate the apertures

13:04.363 --> 13:06.428
on the nine and quarter
catadioptric telescopes?

13:06.579 --> 13:07.579
Sure!

13:07.730 --> 13:08.556
So I was thinking...

13:08.707 --> 13:11.712
After I came to see Madame Pinkie
and the flowerpot landed on my head,

13:11.863 --> 13:13.836
see the bandage, just like
the bandage from the future...

13:13.987 --> 13:14.987
Nice.

13:15.456 --> 13:17.480
I had an epiphany after that flowerpot.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.406
Doing things didn't work,
not doing things didn't work.

13:20.557 --> 13:23.885
And I couldn't predict the future either,
so I only had one other choice...

13:24.356 --> 13:26.707
Monitor everything.

13:26.858 --> 13:28.258
Makes sense to me!

13:28.516 --> 13:31.320
That way no matter what happens
in the future, I'll be ready!

13:31.471 --> 13:33.476
I thought I saw something last night
in the Horsehead nebula.

13:33.627 --> 13:35.406
But after staring at it
for three straight hours,

13:35.557 --> 13:36.957
I realized I was wrong!

13:37.108 --> 13:39.175
Three hours? But when did you sleep?

13:39.326 --> 13:41.706
Oh I didn't sleep. I haven't slept
since future Twilight was here.

13:41.857 --> 13:43.493
There are only three days
left until next Tuesday,

13:43.644 --> 13:45.306
I can sleep all I want after that!

13:45.457 --> 13:47.639
You've been awake too long, Twilight.

13:47.790 --> 13:50.082
Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.733
Tuesday's tomorrow!

13:53.626 --> 13:55.814
Pinkie, did you finish
recalibrating the apertures

13:55.965 --> 13:58.116
on the nine and quarter inch
catadioptric telescopes?

13:58.267 --> 14:00.106
I have no idea!

14:02.654 --> 14:04.530
Ah! My eye!

14:04.781 --> 14:06.946
Don't worry, Twilight,
I have eye patches stashed

14:07.106 --> 14:09.888
all over Ponyville,
in case of eye patch emergency.

14:10.039 --> 14:11.874
There! Now you look like a pirate.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.856
A sleepy pirate,
with a really weird mane cut.

14:15.007 --> 14:17.523
The eye patch...! Another sign!

14:18.406 --> 14:20.356
Nearly all the signs have come true!

14:20.507 --> 14:22.306
I haven't done a thing
to prevent the catastrophe!

14:23.063 --> 14:24.201
If Tuesday's tomorrow,

14:24.352 --> 14:26.021
and the disaster happens
by Tuesday morning,

14:26.172 --> 14:27.606
then there's only one solution.

14:27.756 --> 14:29.323
I'll just have to...

14:29.556 --> 14:31.776
stop time!

14:41.771 --> 14:44.247
Okay, the Canterlot archives
are right over there.

14:44.398 --> 14:45.448
Let's move!

14:54.687 --> 14:56.682
I don't think we need
to sneak around, Twilight.

14:56.833 --> 14:59.067
It's not illegal
to walk around Canterlot.

14:59.218 --> 15:00.218
Guard!

15:01.829 --> 15:03.267
C'mon, you guys!

15:09.667 --> 15:10.787
That was close.

15:10.938 --> 15:13.747
I dunno why we have
to wear these things, either.

15:13.898 --> 15:15.607
Aren't we wearing them for fun?

15:15.757 --> 15:18.089
No, there's nothing fun about this!

15:19.267 --> 15:21.737
- Are you sure?
- Focus, guys!

15:21.888 --> 15:24.413
The only way to prevent this disaster
is to stop time!

15:24.564 --> 15:26.888
Time spells are kept in
the Star Swirl the Bearded wing,

15:27.039 --> 15:28.817
the most secure section of the archives.

15:28.997 --> 15:30.575
That's why we're sneaking around!

15:30.726 --> 15:33.037
Awesome!
That sounds fun!

15:33.187 --> 15:34.987
No, it's not fun!

15:38.326 --> 15:41.054
I still don't understand
how sneaking into the archives

15:41.205 --> 15:43.987
is gonna help her find out
about her birthday present.

15:48.387 --> 15:49.507
The coast is clear.

15:49.658 --> 15:52.210
Now slowly lift me into the window
so we can- AH!

15:56.537 --> 15:58.249
Let's get this over with.

16:20.617 --> 16:24.152
Okay, if my calculations are correct,
the Star Swirl the Bearded wing

16:24.303 --> 16:26.103
should be right... here.

16:26.254 --> 16:27.754
Uh, Twilight?

16:27.905 --> 16:28.705
What is it, Spike?

16:28.856 --> 16:30.267
Isn't this where we came in?

16:30.418 --> 16:32.240
Cool! Can we climb in the window again?

16:32.391 --> 16:33.691
That was super fun!

16:33.842 --> 16:37.192
I don't understand.
It's supposed to be right here...

16:37.343 --> 16:39.029
How are we supposed to find it now?

16:39.180 --> 16:42.575
Maybe we should ask somepony
in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?

16:43.797 --> 16:45.548
Huh. How'd I miss that?

16:45.699 --> 16:48.622
Look at all those
priceless magic scrolls...

16:48.773 --> 16:51.147
There are more than I ever imagined!

16:51.298 --> 16:52.887
Twilight, the guard!

16:55.887 --> 16:57.347
What do we do, what do we do?!

17:04.713 --> 17:07.299
Hey, Twilight,
haven't seen you in a while.

17:07.450 --> 17:08.450
Let me open that for ya.

17:11.987 --> 17:12.930
Thanks!

17:14.138 --> 17:15.363
Oh no!

17:16.364 --> 17:19.341
Look! I look just like future Twilight.

17:19.492 --> 17:21.287
The last sign has come true!

17:21.438 --> 17:23.687
And that's bad, right?

17:23.838 --> 17:24.538
Come on!

17:26.336 --> 17:29.867
It's almost Tuesday morning!
The disaster could happen at any moment!

17:30.018 --> 17:31.947
But how do we find
the time-stopping spell?

17:32.098 --> 17:33.999
There must be a million scrolls here!

17:34.150 --> 17:36.717
I. Don't. Know!

17:56.787 --> 18:00.237
Twilight, it's over!
It's officially Tuesday morning!

18:00.583 --> 18:01.388
No!

18:01.839 --> 18:04.377
Tuesday morning, the disaster!

18:04.528 --> 18:07.178
Incoming!

18:10.598 --> 18:13.849
I dunno, Twilight.
I don't see any disasters.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.707
It looks like a pretty nice day.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.981
Good morning, Twilight,
love the new hairstyle.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.232
Well, happy Tuesday!

18:21.816 --> 18:25.295
Why isn't anypony surprised
to see me sneaking around in here?!

18:26.096 --> 18:28.764
Is it possible
there never was a disaster?

18:28.915 --> 18:32.117
That I've just been making myself
frantic over nothing?!

18:32.468 --> 18:34.070
I don't get it.

18:34.221 --> 18:36.700
If future Twilight wasn't
warning you about a disaster,

18:36.851 --> 18:38.654
then what was she trying to tell you?

18:41.272 --> 18:44.187
I don't know. But I do know one thing.

18:44.338 --> 18:46.592
I look ridiculous!

18:47.357 --> 18:48.891
Yeah, you do!

18:49.042 --> 18:50.862
And it's all because
I couldn't stop worrying

18:51.003 --> 18:53.092
and let the future handle itself!

18:53.243 --> 18:54.943
Well, not any more.

18:55.094 --> 18:57.766
From now on, I'm gonna
solve problems as they come.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.396
And stop worrying about
every little thing!

19:00.547 --> 19:01.547
That's great!

19:01.698 --> 19:04.087
Does that mean there won't be
any more late night pacing?

19:04.238 --> 19:06.055
No more late night pacing.

19:06.206 --> 19:08.587
If only I had learned
this lesson a week ago,

19:08.738 --> 19:10.561
we wouldn't have had
to go through all this.

19:10.712 --> 19:12.751
Twilight, Twilight, I found something!

19:14.037 --> 19:16.504
It doesn't stop time,
but it lets you go back in time.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.854
It says you can go back once,
and it only lasts for a few moments.

19:20.005 --> 19:21.105
Does that help?

19:21.837 --> 19:23.937
Pinkie, you're a genius!

19:25.244 --> 19:28.232
Now I can go back and tell past Twilight
that she doesn't need to go berserk

19:28.383 --> 19:30.657
with worry about a disaster
that's never gonna come!

19:39.586 --> 19:40.395
Twilight,

19:40.546 --> 19:41.695
you've got to listen to me!

19:41.845 --> 19:42.697
Who are you?

19:42.845 --> 19:45.045
I mean, you're me, but I'm me too.

19:45.195 --> 19:46.375
How can there be two 'me's?

19:46.526 --> 19:47.695
It's not scientifically possible.

19:47.846 --> 19:49.753
You are not scientifically possible!

19:49.895 --> 19:50.475
Twilight, please!

19:50.670 --> 19:53.198
I have a very important message
for you from the future!

19:53.500 --> 19:55.165
You're from the future?!

19:55.316 --> 19:56.466
That's right, now listen-

19:56.617 --> 19:59.815
What happened to you?
The future must be awful.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.595
Please! I don't have much time!

20:01.746 --> 20:04.595
Is there some sort of epic pony war
in the distant future or something?

20:04.746 --> 20:07.595
Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning.
But that's not important right now!

20:07.745 --> 20:10.521
I can't believe
time travel's really possible!

20:10.672 --> 20:13.331
How did you, I mean, I figure it out?

20:13.482 --> 20:15.445
The time spells are in
the Canterlot archives.

20:15.595 --> 20:17.045
- But that's not-
- Really? Where?

20:17.195 --> 20:18.086
I've never seen them.

20:18.437 --> 20:20.134
They're in the
Star Swirl the Bearded wing.

20:20.275 --> 20:23.195
- Now, you have to listen to me.
- Is time travel fun, or does it hurt?

20:23.346 --> 20:24.696
I have so many questions-

20:25.287 --> 20:28.246
I have something extremely important
to tell you about the future.

20:28.397 --> 20:30.712
I only have a few seconds,
so you've got to listen!

20:30.863 --> 20:32.245
Whatever you do, don't...

20:33.066 --> 20:36.557
waste your time... worrying... about...

20:37.781 --> 20:40.027
I can't believe I just did that.

20:40.178 --> 20:42.717
Did you tell her about
the cool birthday present?

20:42.868 --> 20:45.968
Remember last week when future Twilight
came to warn me about something?

20:46.219 --> 20:50.107
That was me trying to warn myself
not to worry so much!

20:50.897 --> 20:53.775
Now I'm gonna spend the next week
freaking out about a disaster

20:53.926 --> 20:55.326
that doesn't even exist!

20:56.887 --> 21:00.556
Don't worry about it.
It's past Twilight's problem now.

21:02.314 --> 21:04.554
Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie.

21:04.705 --> 21:07.307
Oh... my stomach...

21:08.508 --> 21:11.511
I think it's all that ice cream...

21:12.162 --> 21:15.887
I thought the stomach ache
would be future Spike's problem...

21:16.138 --> 21:19.027
But now I am future Spike.

21:24.237 --> 21:25.837
Come on, future Spike.

21:27.427 --> 21:29.357
Let's get you home.
