00:04.407 --> 00:07.098
I still can't believe you're
letting me stay here.

00:07.338 --> 00:08.349
As your pupil.

00:08.385 --> 00:11.600
Shining Armor's a
father! I'm an aunt!

00:11.709 --> 00:13.941
Your first friendship
lesson is going to be...

00:14.130 --> 00:15.825
reuniting with Sunburst!

00:16.010 --> 00:18.850
And yes, that's me. Yep.
Ha ha. Important wizard.

00:19.301 --> 00:21.200
The baby is an alicorn!?

00:21.330 --> 00:23.054
So, she could be a
super strong flyer

00:23.098 --> 00:25.047
and have crazy baby magic.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.498
Without the Heart, the Crystal
Empire is about to be buried

00:29.527 --> 00:31.403
under a mountain
of ice and snow!

00:38.539 --> 00:40.506

01:12.240 --> 01:15.258
So, not only can
we not take part

01:15.389 --> 01:17.272
in a fabulous,
ancient ceremony,

01:17.490 --> 01:20.189
but we're also about
to be frozen solid!

01:20.567 --> 01:22.741
Without the Crystal Heart's
magical protection,

01:23.032 --> 01:25.970
the entire city is about to
become a winter wasteland.

01:26.174 --> 01:27.847
But what about
when King Sombra

01:27.905 --> 01:28.712
ruled the
Crystal Empire

01:28.734 --> 01:30.094
and the Crystal
Heart was missing?

01:30.407 --> 01:32.240
The city wasn't
covered in snow then.

01:32.756 --> 01:35.069
The Heart wasn't missing.
It was still in the Castle.

01:35.309 --> 01:36.880
King Sombra had
just hidden it.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.301
I'm afraid Twilight
is correct.

01:39.469 --> 01:41.650
And the storm clouds
are already forming.

01:43.270 --> 01:46.065
I can totally fly up there
and bust those puppies.

01:46.218 --> 01:47.381
No problem.

01:48.385 --> 01:50.181
I wouldn't advise it,
Rainbow Dash.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.800
Those storm clouds are not
like the ones you know.

01:53.018 --> 01:55.381
This far north, the weather
has a will of its own

01:55.650 --> 01:57.498
and now it will
only grow stronger,

01:57.658 --> 01:59.316
enveloping everything
in its path.

01:59.621 --> 02:01.534
Including the
Crystal Empire.

02:01.643 --> 02:02.952
And us along with it

02:06.821 --> 02:08.465
There's gotta be something.

02:10.523 --> 02:13.040
I know Princess Twilight
is keen on the two of us

02:13.061 --> 02:16.123
rekindling our friendship,
but it's been so long.

02:16.378 --> 02:18.610
I don't see how anything on
that list is going to help.

02:19.018 --> 02:21.476
I know, right? It's not
like there's some spell

02:21.498 --> 02:24.261
that would magically compel us
to pick up where we left off.

02:24.661 --> 02:26.370
Oh, actually, there's several.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.927
Mistmane's Material Amity,
Rockhoof's Rapport,

02:30.109 --> 02:32.160
Flashprance's Fellowship...

02:33.716 --> 02:35.192
But I get the
feeling the Princess

02:35.214 --> 02:36.538
isn't looking for a spell.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.341
Definitely not.

02:38.545 --> 02:39.272
Got it!

02:39.556 --> 02:42.036
"...and if all else
fails, ask them to share

02:42.080 --> 02:44.203
an embarrassing moment
from their past,

02:44.385 --> 02:46.683
maybe even something
they regret."

02:48.443 --> 02:50.596
Uh, I don't see how
that would help.

02:50.804 --> 02:54.339
Uh, yeah. We should just
get out of your mane.

02:54.494 --> 02:57.476
It's pretty obvious this isn't
going how Twilight hoped

02:57.563 --> 03:01.083
and I'm sure you have plenty
of important work to do.

03:01.941 --> 03:07.280
What? Oh. Right. Yes.
No rest for the wizardly.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.749
Come on, Spike.

03:16.865 --> 03:19.600
There must be a spell that can
restore the Crystal Heart.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.872
Perhaps.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.141
But it isn't something
that either of us know.

03:23.629 --> 03:26.196
The library here at the
Castle is nearly as extensive

03:26.218 --> 03:27.410
as the one in Canterlot.

03:27.556 --> 03:29.745
There's a good chance we
can find something there.

03:29.934 --> 03:31.330
Can you hold off the storm?

03:31.629 --> 03:35.047
Yes, for a time, but even our
magic will eventually succumb

03:35.069 --> 03:36.712
to the power of
the Frozen North.

03:37.170 --> 03:39.861
We will do what we can,
but you must hurry.

03:53.912 --> 03:56.436
I don't know how long it will
take to find the right spell,

03:56.538 --> 03:58.152
but you should probably
tell the crowd outside

03:58.174 --> 03:59.367
to get somewhere warm.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.665
And try not to mention
the Crystal Heart.

04:01.963 --> 04:03.672
We don't want to start a panic.

04:03.905 --> 04:05.672
Yes, ma'am!
Come on, girls!

04:07.083 --> 04:08.421
I'm going to need
all of your help;

04:08.582 --> 04:10.315
the Crystal library
is enormous.

04:10.836 --> 04:12.101
You can count on us, Twiley!

04:14.814 --> 04:15.345
AHHHHHHH!

04:18.516 --> 04:19.316
Where'd she go?

04:27.469 --> 04:28.261
This way!

04:31.432 --> 04:34.690
Well, Spike, looks like my
biggest fears came true.

04:35.032 --> 04:36.938
I wouldn't be surprised
if Twilight decides

04:36.952 --> 04:38.829
to give up on me entirely.

04:39.941 --> 04:41.410
It's not your fault.

04:41.825 --> 04:44.480
I'm the one who said all
we needed was this list.

04:46.909 --> 04:50.494
It's not the list, Spike.
Or you. Or Twilight.

04:50.923 --> 04:53.309
I'm the one Sunburst doesn't
want to be friends with.

04:53.883 --> 04:56.400
I don't remember him saying
he didn't want to be friends.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.305
He didn't have to say it.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.029
Well, Twilight obviously thinks

05:02.043 --> 05:04.480
you're worth being
friends with and I do too.

05:05.665 --> 05:08.909
Aw thanks, Spike. At
least I have two friends,

05:08.923 --> 05:11.032
even if one of them
has dragon breath.

05:13.694 --> 05:17.243
Um, that's not dragon
breath. It's freezing!

05:17.716 --> 05:19.360
Oh. You're right!

05:19.665 --> 05:21.920
But I thought the Crystal
Heart was supposed to keep

05:21.949 --> 05:23.025
the cold weather out.

05:23.258 --> 05:25.854
It is, unless something's
happened! Come on!

05:30.727 --> 05:33.738
We're just saying that it
might not be the best idea

05:33.774 --> 05:35.258
to stay outside.

05:35.454 --> 05:37.440
I camped out all
night for this spot.

05:37.578 --> 05:39.309
I'm not about to
just give it up.

05:40.618 --> 05:42.734
Still, when you think about it,

05:42.829 --> 05:45.403
the view is just as good
a little further back,

05:45.490 --> 05:47.774
like inside your house.

05:49.745 --> 05:50.960
The Crystalling ceremony

05:50.989 --> 05:52.669
is one of our most
sacred traditions

05:52.821 --> 05:54.938
and when that foal is held
before the Crystal Heart,

05:55.134 --> 05:57.672
I plan to be as close to
the action as possible.

05:58.450 --> 05:59.745
Honestly, I don't know

05:59.760 --> 06:01.221
if there's gonna
be a Crystalling.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.109
The truth is the
baby's an alicorn

06:04.145 --> 06:05.905
and her magic's plum crazy

06:05.927 --> 06:09.258
so you might not want to
be that close after all.

06:09.534 --> 06:13.461
A baby alicorn? Wow. I
can't wait to see that!

06:13.607 --> 06:16.298
Oh, those little wings
are probably so cute!

06:16.421 --> 06:17.803
I know, right?

06:18.007 --> 06:22.160
Look, I am 100% sure the
Crystalling isn't happening.

06:28.603 --> 06:30.000
No Crystalling, huh?

06:30.269 --> 06:32.530
Then why are they
starting a fireworks show?

06:32.654 --> 06:35.309
WOO-HOO!

06:39.112 --> 06:40.109
Young filly!

06:40.858 --> 06:41.309
Whee!

06:41.367 --> 06:42.190
Come back here!

06:43.141 --> 06:44.901
Come to your Auntie Pinkie Pie!

06:45.069 --> 06:47.840
Bridlebuck's Boat Chants,
Hayhoof's Intonements,

06:48.523 --> 06:52.116
Mystic Maps and Mazes.
Anything up there?

06:52.901 --> 06:55.992
Not yet. I'm not even sure
how these are organized.

06:57.098 --> 06:58.138
Geeeeya!

07:05.214 --> 07:08.800
Shining Armor, I thought you
were taking care of the baby.

07:10.356 --> 07:11.752
I'm trying!

07:15.570 --> 07:17.389
Whoo hoo hoo!

07:17.498 --> 07:18.480
Gotcha!

07:20.843 --> 07:21.505
Or not.

07:22.778 --> 07:23.840
Whee!

07:38.843 --> 07:40.181
What is going on!

07:40.283 --> 07:41.905
You want the long or
the short version?

07:42.094 --> 07:42.901
Short?

07:43.083 --> 07:44.727
The baby's an alicorn and
she accidentally destroyed

07:44.749 --> 07:46.385
the Crystal Heart so Twilight
and Cadance are looking

07:46.407 --> 07:47.396
for a spell to put
it back together

07:47.418 --> 07:48.538
and save the Crystal Empire

07:48.552 --> 07:50.574
from turning into a giant
wasteland of ice and snow.

07:51.629 --> 07:52.189
Oh.

07:57.770 --> 08:00.953
What about this? Trotter's
Tome of Reliquary?

08:03.207 --> 08:04.203
I think this is it!

08:04.632 --> 08:08.465
Spell of Relic Reconstitution!
I can't believe we found it.

08:08.785 --> 08:09.978
It's a good thing too.

08:10.058 --> 08:11.825
Without this, I don't
know what we'd do.

08:22.036 --> 08:22.836
Oops.

08:26.509 --> 08:29.403
That spell was the only thing
we found in the whole library

08:29.425 --> 08:31.272
that was even close
to what we needed.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.941
I'm so sorry,
Twilight!

08:34.436 --> 08:35.978
It's not your fault, Starlight.

08:36.269 --> 08:38.203
None of us were
expecting any of this.

08:38.523 --> 08:40.312
Do you think you can
remember the spell?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.363
I only read it through once!

08:42.589 --> 08:45.047
Well, if anypony can
exactly remember something

08:45.069 --> 08:46.930
she read for the first
time two minutes ago,

08:47.040 --> 08:48.436
it's you, Twilight.

08:49.010 --> 08:51.730
I'll try, but I'm not
sure how long it'll take.

08:54.247 --> 08:55.825
Is quickly an option?

08:56.341 --> 08:57.789
I'll help if I can.

08:57.934 --> 09:00.320
But we should evacuate
the city just in case.

09:00.516 --> 09:02.887
You need to lead everypony
to the train station

09:02.909 --> 09:04.385
before the tracks freeze over.

09:04.589 --> 09:06.610
We will. But between
you and Twilight,

09:06.843 --> 09:08.545
I'm sure you'll
remember the spell.

09:12.472 --> 09:14.669
I only hope this spell
is the one we need.

09:17.207 --> 09:18.843
Is there anything I can do?

09:19.061 --> 09:22.094
I don't think so. I'm just
sorry about your lesson.

09:22.203 --> 09:23.469
That doesn't matter now.

09:23.658 --> 09:26.210
Sunburst and I don't have
anything in common anyway.

09:26.450 --> 09:28.392
He's a big important wizard

09:28.618 --> 09:31.090
and I'm relearning everything
I ever thought I knew.

09:31.483 --> 09:34.167
Sunburst? I don't
recognize the name,

09:34.203 --> 09:36.210
but if he's an
important wizard,

09:36.240 --> 09:37.454
you should
bring him here.

09:37.716 --> 09:39.818
Maybe he'll know what to
do if the spell fails.

09:40.392 --> 09:41.345
Of course!

09:42.916 --> 09:44.320
You better go with her, Spike.

09:57.570 --> 10:00.196
Sunburst! Haven't
you looked outside?

10:01.534 --> 10:05.163
Snow? That's not right.
The Crystal Heart...

10:05.280 --> 10:06.894
...is gone. The baby...

10:06.945 --> 10:10.225
Shining Armor and Cadance's
baby. It's an alicorn.

10:11.505 --> 10:12.283
Really!?

10:12.494 --> 10:14.727
Really! And her magic
is a little berserk

10:14.770 --> 10:16.283
and, well, I guess she
destroyed the Heart.

10:16.458 --> 10:17.709
But Twilight thinks
she can fix it

10:17.738 --> 10:19.541
and Princess Cadance
thought you could help.

10:21.010 --> 10:21.694
Me?

10:22.043 --> 10:24.763
Of course! You're an important
wizard in the Crystal Empire.

10:24.785 --> 10:25.912
It just makes sense.

10:26.705 --> 10:27.192
Right.

10:27.505 --> 10:29.018
Right, right, right, right.

10:30.909 --> 10:33.185
You know, I'd like to
help. I-I really would.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.916
I-I just have so much, um...

10:35.178 --> 10:36.923
important wizard work
to do around here.

10:37.621 --> 10:38.349
Huh?

10:39.701 --> 10:41.680
You can't stay here!

10:41.832 --> 10:44.312
Did I mention this was
a Royal Crystalling?

10:44.501 --> 10:46.690
When the Crystaller holds
the young one aloft,

10:46.930 --> 10:49.883
all of the Empire will
share their joy and light

10:50.087 --> 10:52.196
and the Crystal Heart
will beat stronger

10:52.218 --> 10:54.276
than it ever has before.

10:54.443 --> 10:56.450
It really is a moving ceremony.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.618
I really don't think
it's going to happen.

11:00.836 --> 11:03.280
Come on! It's freezing out here!

11:03.665 --> 11:05.876
Uh, this is the Crystal Empire.

11:05.970 --> 11:07.803
We've seen snow before.

11:08.196 --> 11:09.818
Not like this!

11:10.480 --> 11:12.101
We don't have time to argue.

11:12.312 --> 11:14.967
Princess Cadance has decided
to evacuate the city.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.043
But the Crystalling!

11:18.327 --> 11:19.941
I don't know if we'll
ever have another

11:19.963 --> 11:21.170
Crystalling again.

11:21.447 --> 11:24.007
The Crystal Heart is shattered.

11:27.112 --> 11:28.596
It's not safe here!

11:29.876 --> 11:32.625
That's what we've been
trying to tell you!

11:37.178 --> 11:40.407
Sunburst, I know you're busy,
but did you hear what I said?

11:40.981 --> 11:43.360
Oh, I heard you,
but-but like I said,

11:43.381 --> 11:45.818
when you're an important
wizard the work just piles up.

11:45.934 --> 11:46.960
Sunburst!

11:49.098 --> 11:52.043
Look, Starlight, I
want to help, I do.

11:52.443 --> 11:54.807
But I can't. I wish I could.

11:55.127 --> 11:56.334
What do you mean?

11:56.829 --> 11:58.356
Fixing an ancient relic?

11:58.378 --> 12:01.083
I-I can't even come close to
doing something like that!

12:01.425 --> 12:04.043
But I thought you were
an important wizard.

12:04.996 --> 12:06.560
Well, you were wrong! OK?

12:06.734 --> 12:10.283
I'm not an important wizard!
I'm not even a wizard at all!

12:21.100 --> 12:22.792
I know it's hard for
you to understand,

12:22.814 --> 12:25.381
but not all of us end
up achieving greatness!

12:25.883 --> 12:28.843
What? Why wouldn't
I understand that?

12:29.469 --> 12:32.552
Really? You're the protégé of
the Princess of Friendship.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.996
I don't think she picks
just anypony for that.

12:36.174 --> 12:38.560
Technically, she's more of
a student than a protégé.

12:40.509 --> 12:43.730
Whatever. I'm sorry I'm not
the big, important wizard

12:43.752 --> 12:44.821
you were expecting.

12:45.963 --> 12:48.807
Sunburst! I don't care if
you're a wizard or not.

12:48.829 --> 12:52.269
I'm just surprised. You always
knew so much about magic.

12:52.509 --> 12:54.145
I mean, look at all these books!

12:55.338 --> 12:58.087
Yeah, well, reading
about magic is one thing,

12:58.109 --> 13:00.363
but you don't know what it
was like at Magic School,

13:00.654 --> 13:03.738
to know so much and not
be able to do any of it!

13:06.698 --> 13:09.265
Well, you don't know what it
was like to be left behind!

13:09.410 --> 13:11.592
And then getting so bitter
that you steal the cutie marks

13:11.614 --> 13:13.730
from an entire village
and then get defeated

13:13.752 --> 13:14.974
by Twilight and her friends.

13:15.025 --> 13:16.705
So you travel through
time to get back at them,

13:16.727 --> 13:19.018
but they beat you again and
teach you about friendship,

13:19.054 --> 13:21.840
but you're so terrified ponies
will find out what you did

13:21.869 --> 13:23.760
that you can't make any friends!

13:30.530 --> 13:32.021
Did you really
travel through time?

13:32.970 --> 13:34.974
See? I told you
he'd be impressed.

13:35.745 --> 13:38.930
I'm sorry we lost touch.
Maybe if I had reached out,

13:39.010 --> 13:40.785
you could have helped
me at Magic School

13:40.836 --> 13:42.145
and I could have
helped you to...

13:42.389 --> 13:44.289
Not become totally evil?

13:46.589 --> 13:49.672
Let's just say
I know what it's like

13:49.694 --> 13:52.618
to have something you're
not exactly proud of.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.432
You showed up thinking
I was some big wizard.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.705
I'm sorry. I should
have told you the truth.

13:59.192 --> 14:01.920
It's fine. At least
we worked it all out.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.941
I think Twilight
would be proud of us.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.385
Well, if you ever want
to tell her about it,

14:06.487 --> 14:08.007
we should probably leave now!

14:08.683 --> 14:11.127
I forgot to tell you,
they're evacuating the city!

14:11.360 --> 14:12.960
You need to get to
the train station,

14:13.090 --> 14:14.414
unless you've got a spell here

14:14.436 --> 14:15.680
that will drive back
the Frozen North

14:15.701 --> 14:16.589
and fix the Crystal Heart

14:16.603 --> 14:17.978
so the baby can have
her Crystalling?

14:19.214 --> 14:22.029
The Crystalling. Of course!

14:34.567 --> 14:36.574
Push them back, my sister!

14:46.472 --> 14:47.556
This way!

15:01.643 --> 15:03.345
Just a little bit
further, y'all!

15:03.447 --> 15:04.858
The station's just ahead!

15:10.000 --> 15:11.825
We have to go back!

15:12.340 --> 15:14.167
I know how to stop this!

15:23.054 --> 15:25.505
Uh, I think that's everything.

15:26.952 --> 15:28.094
It looks right to me,

15:28.138 --> 15:30.465
but there's only
one way to find out.

15:46.865 --> 15:49.629
The spell failed. I don't
know what else to do.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.872
An old student of
mine believes he does.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.967
The baby did this!?

15:59.236 --> 16:00.814
I tried putting it
back together with...

16:00.909 --> 16:02.567
...the Spell of Relic
Reconstitution.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.585
That won't do it.

16:03.854 --> 16:05.549
The Crystal Heart's been
around for millennia.

16:05.818 --> 16:08.647
Restoring a relic like this is
magic way beyond one spell.

16:08.930 --> 16:10.705
You'd need to combine
it with something else,

16:10.814 --> 16:12.749
something unique to
the relic itself,

16:12.960 --> 16:16.458
something that strengthens it
and provides it with power.

16:18.036 --> 16:19.280
The Crystalling!

16:19.752 --> 16:22.203
Combining that spell
with the light and love

16:22.247 --> 16:25.127
of everypony gathered for the
ceremony, together with...

16:25.716 --> 16:27.738
Somnambula's Weather Abjuration

16:27.752 --> 16:29.745
to clear away the snow and...

16:30.116 --> 16:32.676
A little Fledgling's
Forbearance for the parents.

16:35.134 --> 16:37.825
That should curb the little
one's power fluctuations.

16:39.890 --> 16:41.418
You must be Sunburst.

16:41.490 --> 16:43.570
Starlight said you
were a powerful wizard.

16:43.956 --> 16:45.265
Oh, I'm no wizard.

16:45.490 --> 16:46.378
Huh? What?

16:47.498 --> 16:49.890
But he studied magic
his whole life!

16:50.130 --> 16:51.272
You should see his house!

16:51.461 --> 16:53.629
And since no pony
has any better ideas,

16:53.774 --> 16:55.549
what do we have to lose?

16:59.614 --> 17:02.203
I had planned on asking
Twilight to be our Crystaller,

17:02.363 --> 17:04.341
but since it seems
like she'll be busy...

17:06.676 --> 17:07.636
I'd be honored.

17:09.090 --> 17:10.945
Well, what are we waiting for?

17:52.400 --> 17:55.272
Citizens, may I present
the newest member

17:55.294 --> 17:57.127
of the Crystal Empire!

18:05.803 --> 18:07.265
She's beautiful.

18:07.469 --> 18:09.592
Oh! It's just so moving.

18:57.432 --> 18:59.956
Best. Crystalling. Ever!

19:03.185 --> 19:06.952
For a Pony who isn't great at
magic, you did pretty well.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.613
Indeed.

19:08.901 --> 19:10.450
I'm glad to see
you've found a way

19:10.480 --> 19:12.770
to share your unique
gift, Sunburst.

19:13.090 --> 19:15.680
You may be more of a
wizard than you think.

19:20.298 --> 19:22.661
You would not believe
the crazy weather

19:22.683 --> 19:23.818
that delayed our train!

19:24.450 --> 19:25.476
Came out of nowhere!

19:25.796 --> 19:28.872
But it was all worth it to see
this peaceful little angel.

19:29.352 --> 19:33.105
Aww so sweet, come
to your grandmare.

19:35.003 --> 19:37.425
Yeah. Peaceful now, anyway.

19:37.658 --> 19:39.898
I suppose that spell
really did the trick.

19:42.952 --> 19:43.905
Aaaah!

19:44.421 --> 19:46.269
Achoo!

19:50.550 --> 19:52.429
We have Sunburst
to thank for that.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.636
I hope he takes his role
as Crystaller seriously.

19:55.912 --> 19:58.858
Something tells me the baby
will need a pony like him

19:59.090 --> 20:00.814
to look to for magical advice.

20:01.210 --> 20:03.330
Cadence, darling,
aren't we going to name

20:03.360 --> 20:04.952
the poor little dear or
are we going to spend

20:04.974 --> 20:07.578
the entire visit just
calling her "the baby?"

20:08.625 --> 20:11.730
We were thinking, Flurry Heart.

20:12.043 --> 20:13.890
You know, to remember
the occasion.

20:14.232 --> 20:17.207
Oh goodness! How
could anypony forget?

20:17.672 --> 20:19.018
I think it's lovely.

20:22.901 --> 20:25.010
Well, I think you're
the Crystal Empire's

20:25.098 --> 20:28.290
big, important wizard,
whether you like it or not.

20:28.712 --> 20:30.749
I don't know if I'll have
time for any wizarding.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.316
I'm a Crystaller now.
That's a big responsibility.

20:33.694 --> 20:36.341
I can't think of
anypony more qualified.

20:36.727 --> 20:38.610
Just promise you'll
stay in touch?

20:39.490 --> 20:41.760
Like I'd ever lose touch
with my oldest friend.

20:46.850 --> 20:48.298
What's wrong, Twilight?

20:49.214 --> 20:50.567
I don't know, Spike.

20:50.705 --> 20:53.287
I think I have a lot to
learn about being a teacher.

20:53.578 --> 20:56.305
What are you talking about?
Your lesson went perfectly.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.290
Starlight and Sunburst
got over their past

20:58.312 --> 20:59.505
and rekindled their friendship.

20:59.665 --> 21:00.850
No thanks to me.

21:01.069 --> 21:03.709
I know a lot happened; I
just wish I could have given

21:03.723 --> 21:06.029
my pupil the attention
she deserves.

21:07.789 --> 21:11.076
Well, I know she needed to
be put on the right path,

21:11.447 --> 21:13.389
but giving her the space
to make her own decisions

21:13.410 --> 21:14.334
worked pretty well.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.581
Isn't that how
Celestia taught you?

21:18.036 --> 21:21.447
You know, I never thought
about it, but I guess it is.

21:21.854 --> 21:24.123
Maybe you're a better
teacher than you thought.
