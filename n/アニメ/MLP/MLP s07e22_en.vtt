WEBVTT

00:06.606 --> 00:07.372
[snap] Oh!

00:14.647 --> 00:16.148
Ah. Thank goodness.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.150
I thought I had too
many deep fried gems.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.222
It's from my parents!

00:23.424 --> 00:24.222
Spike!

00:24.324 --> 00:27.593
They won a zeppelin cruise and
get to take the whole family!

00:29.261 --> 00:32.231
Ohh...I wish I had
time to go with them,

00:32.433 --> 00:33.999
but there's just too
many Princess duties

00:34.101 --> 00:35.367
I have to take care of.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.671
Come on, Twilight.

00:38.773 --> 00:41.106
Even Princess Celestia
takes a break sometimes

00:41.208 --> 00:42.774
and she raises the sun!

00:46.579 --> 00:49.081
Ugh. You need a vacation.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.783
I can keep track of
the Friendship log,

00:50.885 --> 00:53.919
boost community morale and
answer fan mail for a few days.

00:54.021 --> 00:57.222
But Spike, you're as much a
part of my family as anypony.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.658
I can't just leave you
here to do all that work.

01:00.160 --> 01:00.926
What?

01:01.028 --> 01:02.161
I can't hear you.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.230
You're on vacation.

01:05.132 --> 01:08.934
I guess I could use a little
time off from being a Princess.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.836
You're the best, Spike.

01:11.438 --> 01:12.471
I know.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.575
I'm going to go pack everything
neatly into one suitcase!

01:16.577 --> 01:18.311
Wait for it....

01:19.213 --> 01:20.712
Twilight: Cruises have activities, right?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.381
I should probably
make a schedule!?

01:22.583 --> 01:23.582
There it is.

02:05.693 --> 02:11.530
Oh, gee, I am really looking
forward to a relaxing vacation.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.664
Watch out.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.766
She won't admit it, but
when your mother says

02:14.868 --> 02:16.301
"relaxing vacation"

02:16.403 --> 02:18.337
she means "doing
something crazy."

02:18.439 --> 02:21.540
Last time she ended up bungee
jumping over Luna Bay.

02:21.742 --> 02:22.708
What was that, hon?

02:22.910 --> 02:24.743
Oh, I was uh just
telling Twilight

02:24.845 --> 02:27.145
about my new uh, bingo
strategy book.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.147
It's a real page-turner!

02:30.250 --> 02:34.419
Oh, I can't wait to get on this
zeppelin and fly like a pegasus!

02:34.521 --> 02:37.155
Really? I remember
you getting air-sick

02:37.257 --> 02:39.926
on Admiral Fairweather's Wild
Ride at Pony Island.

02:41.328 --> 02:45.297
Ah please, I grew out of
air-sickness a long time ago.

02:47.533 --> 02:52.838
[drill sargeant voice]
<i>I hope you ponies feel welcomed</i>
<i> aboard BECAUSE YOU ARE!</i>

02:53.040 --> 02:56.407
Well, that was an....
assertive welcome.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.637
Guess this is what it's like
to be big-time prize winners.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.139
Ha ha ha.

03:27.241 --> 03:30.442
I just wish I could remember
what contest we won.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.779
Wait. You don't know where
this prize came from?

03:33.981 --> 03:36.782
When somepony offers
you a free vacation,

03:36.884 --> 03:40.285
you just sign the paperwork
and don't ask questions.

03:40.687 --> 03:44.623
Especially when it means we
all get to fly off together.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.091
What should we do first?

03:46.493 --> 03:48.560
Well, I did categorize
the ship's activities

03:48.662 --> 03:50.963
and make a schedule organized
by each of our interests!

03:52.065 --> 03:53.231
Dad, you're easy.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.434
Bingo competition right here.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.504
Oh, I just love how the numbers
and letters are organized

03:59.606 --> 04:01.139
in their little boxes.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.841
It's so satisfying!

04:03.043 --> 04:05.010
Shining Armor, they've
got a tiny boat race

04:05.112 --> 04:06.812
in a tiny pool, here.

04:07.014 --> 04:10.916
Aw, sis, only you would
remember I love tiny things.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.016
And Cadance?

04:12.118 --> 04:14.285
There's a Pee-wee
Princess Playtime here

04:14.387 --> 04:15.754
that Flurry's gonna love.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.057
Oh! Wonderful!

04:19.659 --> 04:20.692
Hmmm.

04:20.794 --> 04:25.264
This barrel jumping at Neighagra
Falls sounds interesting.

04:26.366 --> 04:26.832
Eh.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.536
I just want to see
you all have a good time.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.004
And this works out perfectly,

04:33.106 --> 04:35.607
because we have room for
the one thing I want to do!

04:35.809 --> 04:38.177
Our ship passes the
Frozen North at sunset,

04:38.279 --> 04:41.212
which is the only time you can
see the astrological phenomenon

04:41.314 --> 04:43.582
known as the "Northern Stars."

04:43.984 --> 04:46.551
It's like the stars are shooting
out of the setting sun!

04:46.921 --> 04:49.353
Aw!
That sounds amazing!
Wow!

04:49.456 --> 04:52.190
Well, we definitely
don't want to miss that!

04:53.092 --> 04:54.126
Then it's settled!

04:54.528 --> 04:56.728
Hm, but we don't have
anything to do right now.

04:56.830 --> 04:57.896
Any suggestions?

04:59.166 --> 05:03.568
ATTENTION CRUISE PONIES: DON'T
LET THIS ZEPPELIN BE A BORE;

05:03.670 --> 05:06.471
LEAVE YOUR ROOM
AND SEE THE TOUR!

05:06.773 --> 05:08.506
A tour could be fun.

05:08.710 --> 05:10.442
Hmm yea!
OK, Sure.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.547
I'm flying! I'm--

05:17.551 --> 05:20.118
I'm afraid
Flurry may be air-sick.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.554
Since I know that isn't
a problem for you,

05:22.656 --> 05:24.923
would you mind
taking her below?

05:27.126 --> 05:30.129
FAR TO OUR RIGHT, YOU
CAN JUST MAKE OUT

05:30.231 --> 05:32.097
THE WHITE TUFTS OF CLOUDSDALE

05:32.499 --> 05:37.168
WHERE PRINCESS TWILIGHT SPARKLE
ONCE TOURED THE WEATHER FACTORY.

05:39.439 --> 05:40.539
How'd he know that?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.474
And why announce it on a cruise?

05:47.147 --> 05:49.748
Why don't we move to the
other side of the deck?

05:53.319 --> 05:57.088
WE ARE NOW HIGH ENOUGH
TO SEE ALL OF CANTERLOT,

05:57.190 --> 06:00.158
EVEN THE ROYAL TREE WHERE
PRINCESS TWILIGHT

06:00.260 --> 06:03.695
AND HER BROTHER SHINING
ARMOR WERE BORN!

06:03.797 --> 06:05.463
What? That's not right.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.402
Let's get down for that!

06:10.904 --> 06:13.772
Um, you guys know that's
not where we were born.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.507
What are you so excited about?

06:16.009 --> 06:19.277
Well, it is a really
nice tree, sweetheart.

06:22.615 --> 06:25.350
We just wanted to say how
excited we are to be here!

06:25.452 --> 06:27.953
Um, yeah, us too.

06:28.055 --> 06:33.258
ON OUR ROUTE NORTH, WE WILL PASS
THE SPIRES OF THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE

06:33.460 --> 06:38.363
WHERE PRINCESS CADANCE RESCUED
HER ALICORN BABY, SPIKE,

06:38.465 --> 06:41.166
FROM A MONSTER MADE OF FIRE!

06:41.268 --> 06:43.101
Well, that doesn't
even make sense!

06:43.203 --> 06:46.436
Night Light: "Well,
Royal Grandparents" sounds a bit fancy,

06:46.540 --> 06:48.740
but of course you
can take our picture.

06:52.145 --> 06:52.944
What!?

07:01.420 --> 07:02.320
OH!

07:02.422 --> 07:04.322
OK, that's it!

07:04.524 --> 07:06.858
Does anypony know where
the cruise announcer is?

07:09.695 --> 07:10.996
Excuse me, sir.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.500
YOU CAN CALL IRON
WILL, IRON WILL.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.235
[gasp] What are you doing here?

07:17.337 --> 07:19.037
And why do you keep
announcing random things

07:19.139 --> 07:20.372
about me and my family?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.874
THE ASSERTIVENESS
SEMINAR MARKET DRIED UP,

07:22.976 --> 07:25.210
SO IRON WILL STARTED
A NEW CAREER...

07:25.412 --> 07:28.680
ORGANIZING THEMED
VACATION PACKAGES.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.149
And the theme of this
vacation is... ?

07:31.551 --> 07:36.855
EVERYPONY! STOMP YOUR HOOVES IF
YOU ARE HERE FOR THE PREMIER

07:36.957 --> 07:40.692
'CRUISE OF THE
PRINCESSES' EXPERIENCE!

07:55.408 --> 07:58.843
Iron Will, I'm not sure it was
entirely honest of you to offer

07:58.945 --> 08:00.846
this cruise to my family
without telling us

08:00.948 --> 08:03.849
that ponies bought tickets
just to see Cadance and me!

08:04.051 --> 08:07.552
Iron Will outlined all the
details of the cruise in the

08:07.654 --> 08:12.324
prize acceptance and consent
form that you signed.

08:12.426 --> 08:15.260
Well, when somepony offers
you a free vacation,

08:15.462 --> 08:17.263
who reads the fine print?

08:18.065 --> 08:20.465
Iron Will prides
himself on providing

08:20.567 --> 08:22.601
a quality vacation experience,

08:22.703 --> 08:27.572
but if Twilight Sparkle and
her family don't want it,

08:27.674 --> 08:30.175
Iron Will can cancel the cruise

08:30.277 --> 08:36.415
and break the hearts of every
Princess-adoring pony on board.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.516
Ugh...

08:37.618 --> 08:40.385
I love you Princess
Twilight!

08:40.487 --> 08:43.021
As much as I want
a family vacation,

08:43.123 --> 08:45.957
I don't think I could entertain
all these cruise ponies.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.994
My hooves are pretty full
taking care of Flurry Heart.

08:49.096 --> 08:53.031
I guess we were just so excited
by the idea of a family cruise.

08:53.233 --> 08:58.136
[sigh] All right, I guess we
better turn this ship around.

08:59.739 --> 09:02.941
Wait! Iron Will, what if
I offered you a deal?

09:03.043 --> 09:06.411
If I agree to do whatever
princess activities you want,

09:06.613 --> 09:07.912
will you promise
that my family

09:08.014 --> 09:10.281
gets to do the
activities they want?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.250
Sis, you don't
have to do that.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.085
We want you to
enjoy yourself too.

09:15.587 --> 09:18.690
I don't want the vacation to end
now or let down all of these

09:18.792 --> 09:20.760
ponies who were looking
forward to seeing us.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.363
So what do you say, Iron
Will? Do we have a deal?

09:25.165 --> 09:28.166
PRINCESS TWILIGHT
HAS A DEAL!

09:29.201 --> 09:29.835
Great!

09:30.137 --> 09:32.604
So it looks like we have some
time before Dad plays Bingo-

09:32.706 --> 09:34.873
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE JUST
ENOUGH TO PICK THE WINNER

09:34.975 --> 09:36.508
OF OUR GRAND PRIZE RAFFLE.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.811
Oh. Well, [chuckle] who
doesn't like prizes?

09:41.681 --> 09:43.982
ALL RIGHT CRUISE PONIES:

09:44.084 --> 09:47.953
WHEN THE ZEPPELIN FLIES
IT'S TIME FOR A PRIZE!

09:52.626 --> 09:55.293
Thank you all for being so
gracious and respectful

09:55.395 --> 09:56.828
to me and my family.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.831
And now, without further
ado, the winner is...

10:02.101 --> 10:03.301
Star Tracker!

10:04.738 --> 10:06.371
Congratulations, Star Tracker!

10:06.473 --> 10:07.639
Enjoy your prize.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.208
OK Dad, bingo time!

10:11.410 --> 10:12.243
Uh...Oh!

10:12.345 --> 10:15.013
I'm sorry, I don't
have the prize.

10:15.315 --> 10:19.984
CONGRATULATIONS TO STAR TRACKER
WHO WINS THE GRAND PRIZE:

10:20.086 --> 10:22.020
SPENDING THE DAY WITH TWILIGHT

10:22.122 --> 10:25.557
AS AN HONORARY MEMBER
OF HER FAMILY!

10:28.028 --> 10:29.561
That's the prize!?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.997
Uh huh...heh heh.

10:32.699 --> 10:35.333
OK! Well, I guess you
should come with us,

10:35.435 --> 10:37.001
honorary family member!

10:37.103 --> 10:40.605
Sure! Hah. There's always
room at the bingo table.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.075
Ahem.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.677
Is everypony ready?

10:45.879 --> 10:47.678
Night Light: Sure are, sweetie.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.882
Give that cage a whirl!

10:51.284 --> 10:51.850
Dad?

10:51.952 --> 10:52.984
[on megaphone] What did you say?

10:53.086 --> 10:56.054
Uh...he...He said to
uh...give it a...a whirl.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.589
Oh! Um, thanks.

11:04.730 --> 11:05.964
I-19!

11:06.166 --> 11:08.133
Heh hey! Now we're talking!

11:08.835 --> 11:12.003
This Princess Bingo is great!

11:13.472 --> 11:14.773
Did you get that one, Dad?

11:14.875 --> 11:16.942
[on megaphone] Can anypony tell me
how my dad is doing?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.845
He uh...he said the Princess
Bingo is uh great hah.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.146
Crowd: Princess Bingo!

11:22.248 --> 11:24.115
Princess Bingo!

11:24.217 --> 11:26.217
Princess Bingo!

11:26.319 --> 11:28.753
Twilight is my
favorite time of day. Heh heh.

11:29.055 --> 11:29.955
And it's
also your name.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.257
[nervous laugh] I just thought
that was cool.

11:37.329 --> 11:38.063
Whew!

11:38.365 --> 11:39.163
Just made it!

11:39.765 --> 11:43.034
And I'm ready to give you the
tiny boat race of your life!

11:44.036 --> 11:46.372
Are you sure you're not
air-sick, Big Brother?

11:47.474 --> 11:48.239
No way.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.941
How can I be air sick?

11:50.043 --> 11:53.211
I'm in the water, so
it totally cancels out.

11:54.480 --> 11:58.350
I don't think that's how it
works, but I'm ready if you are!

11:58.952 --> 12:01.986
TECHNICALLY, PRINCESS TWILIGHT
SPARKLE SHOULD OFFICIATE

12:02.088 --> 12:03.621
THE PRINCESS PADDLE BOAT RACE.

12:05.424 --> 12:08.560
Well, I suppose I could
race your brother.

12:09.663 --> 12:13.798
Oh. Well, as long as Shining Armor
gets to race, I'm happy.

12:18.671 --> 12:19.504
Heh heh..

12:19.606 --> 12:20.304
Sorry....

12:21.506 --> 12:24.075
I'm going to write about this
race tonight in my journal.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.545
Ha ha. Uhhh! It's
just so exciting!

12:27.547 --> 12:28.546
On your mark...

12:28.748 --> 12:29.447
Get set...

12:29.549 --> 12:30.782
GO! Ha ha!

12:30.984 --> 12:32.452
Woooooooo!

12:33.954 --> 12:36.254
Ha ha ha! My word,
that was exciting!

12:36.456 --> 12:37.789
Wasn't it, son!?

12:37.891 --> 12:38.923
Ha ha ha!

12:41.227 --> 12:44.329
Just so everypony knows, I'm
getting out of this boat

12:44.431 --> 12:47.265
because of how not sick I feel.

12:49.302 --> 12:53.671
Awww, that's all right dear,
we'll take you back to the room.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.743
THAT WAS JUST THE
FIRST HEAT OF TEN.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.582
NOW WHO'S READY TO
SEE A PRINCESS FACE

13:04.684 --> 13:07.118
WHEN THEY WIN
THEIR RACE?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.319
Yeah!

13:08.421 --> 13:09.487
Whoo hoo!

13:21.967 --> 13:22.866
Twilight: Cadance.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.704
I'm so glad you got in the
Pee-wee Princess Playtime.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.306
Flurry is having
a wonderful time.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.510
That's great; I'm just
on my way to take some

13:32.612 --> 13:34.078
Old-Time Appleoosan Photos.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.848
Themed photo shoots
are the best. Heh.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.451
And then do a quick question and
answer session on becoming an

13:39.553 --> 13:42.654
Alicorn before Mom's barrel
ride at Neighagra Falls.

13:42.756 --> 13:44.156
I really hope I don't miss that!

13:45.358 --> 13:47.458
Twilight, are you sure
you don't mind doing

13:47.560 --> 13:49.660
all of these Princess
activities?

13:49.762 --> 13:51.963
Mind? What? Absolutely not!

13:52.065 --> 13:53.999
I mean, you guys are
having fun, right?

13:54.601 --> 13:57.836
Ughh...besides, I have to make
sure these cruise ponies

13:57.938 --> 14:00.272
are happy if I want to
be a good Princess.

14:00.774 --> 14:03.108
You're already a good
Princess, Twilight.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.544
Honestly, as long as I get to
see the Northern Stars tonight

14:06.646 --> 14:08.613
with everypony, I'll be happy.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.651
But right now I gotta
go take some pictures.

14:13.753 --> 14:14.686
See ya later!

14:15.855 --> 14:18.256
Why don't you play and
make a Princess friend!

14:22.062 --> 14:27.999
Uh.. I am so sorry, everypony, but it
looks like Flurry needs her nap.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.206
Oh! Why did that last question
have to be a two-parter?

14:35.408 --> 14:38.009
I just hope I have time for
one barrel ride with Mom.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.883
Ohh!

14:44.985 --> 14:48.186
Neighagra Falls was amazing!

14:48.388 --> 14:49.754
The endless open air!

14:49.856 --> 14:51.389
The water in my mane!

14:51.491 --> 14:54.426
Oh! The small confines
of the barrel!

14:54.928 --> 14:59.464
Ha ha! Another "relaxing
vacation" in the books, hon.

15:03.535 --> 15:05.403
Oh, honey, I know
you're disappointed,

15:05.505 --> 15:07.639
but we waited as
long as we could.

15:07.841 --> 15:11.143
Maybe you should take a break
from these Princess things?

15:12.045 --> 15:13.812
Disappointed? No!

15:13.914 --> 15:16.014
I've just been answering
some detailed questions

15:16.116 --> 15:17.081
about Alicorns.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.050
You know how much
I love details!

15:19.552 --> 15:23.354
I just don't want you to
forget it's your vacation, too.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.891
How can I when it's a
totally successful vacation?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.227
All right.

15:29.329 --> 15:33.064
Well, we can't wait to
see those Northern Stars!

15:35.567 --> 15:38.403
IRON WILL LIVED UP TO
HIS SIDE OF THE BARGAIN

15:38.505 --> 15:41.205
AND PRINCESS TWILIGHT
ONLY HAS ONE MORE THING

15:41.307 --> 15:42.440
TO DO FOR THE DAY.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.412
IT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE.

15:47.514 --> 15:51.816
COME GET IN LINE IF YOU
WANT THE PRINCESS TO SIGN!

16:08.667 --> 16:10.201
How long have
you been waiting?

16:15.474 --> 16:16.240
Oh, no.

16:16.342 --> 16:17.175
What time is it!?

16:31.090 --> 16:33.724
I missed them? I missed
the Northern Stars?

16:35.829 --> 16:39.230
You were right, Twilight.
They were breathtaking.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.900
We wish you'd been here
to see it, sweet pea,

16:43.002 --> 16:44.502
but we're sure you're making

16:44.604 --> 16:46.972
a whole bunch of
cruise ponies happy.

16:47.274 --> 16:50.341
Heheh.. I'm so happy I could cry.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.143
Oh, yeah.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.178
The cruise ponies are happy.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.880
My family is happy.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.915
Even Iron Will is happy.

17:00.986 --> 17:02.687
You know who isn't happy!?

17:02.789 --> 17:03.688
ME!

17:05.158 --> 17:07.425
Ow! My hoof!

17:07.627 --> 17:10.428
I'm sorry, but maybe that
wouldn't have happened

17:10.530 --> 17:12.563
if you weren't practically
standing on my tail!

17:12.665 --> 17:14.866
Not even my real
family stands so close!

17:16.369 --> 17:17.101
Ugh!

17:21.640 --> 17:22.641
Twilight?

17:23.343 --> 17:25.710
I only made that deal with
Iron Will so my family

17:25.812 --> 17:28.480
and the cruise ponies could have
the vacation they wanted.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.949
What about what you wanted?

17:31.851 --> 17:34.019
I just want everypony
to be happy.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.588
Well, sometimes ponies
want more from a Princess

17:37.690 --> 17:38.790
than you can give

17:38.992 --> 17:41.459
and it can be hard to know
where to draw the line.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.528
You seem to know
pretty well.

17:44.230 --> 17:48.033
Once I had Flurry Heart, the
line was easier for me to see.

17:48.635 --> 17:51.469
You will always have
obligations as a princess,

17:51.671 --> 17:54.438
but you also have an
obligation to yourself.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.241
You're right.

17:58.343 --> 18:00.945
I think I need to set some
boundaries, but first,

18:01.347 --> 18:03.081
I owe somepony an apology.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.918
Aww...how's that, dearie?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.453
Better, thanks.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.491
Agh! But I think I should go!

18:13.893 --> 18:16.394
No, Star Tracker,
you should stay.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.430
I have something to
tell you...all of you.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.933
I'm glad you all got to
do the things you wanted,

18:22.335 --> 18:23.735
but I should have
stood up for myself

18:23.837 --> 18:25.904
so that I could do
what I wanted too.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.606
It wasn't fair of me
to lash out at you.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.975
If I felt like you were
standing too close,

18:31.177 --> 18:32.543
I should have said something.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.012
I'm sorry.

18:37.850 --> 18:41.018
What do you say we do
something off the schedule?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.789
Who are you..?

18:45.191 --> 18:49.294
Yep! We're gonna do something
I want us to do as a family.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.529
Honorary members too.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.348
You and your family have been
really kind to include me,

19:10.550 --> 19:13.185
but you deserve your
own vacation together.

19:14.087 --> 19:16.287
Heh heh. And I'm really
glad we met too. Ha ha.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.421
Oh!

19:20.159 --> 19:21.893
Attention, cruise ponies!

19:21.995 --> 19:25.963
If it's your dream, come
to the deck for ice cream!

19:27.766 --> 19:29.133
Oh no!

19:29.335 --> 19:31.102
Leave the Princess alone!

19:31.304 --> 19:33.672
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO IRON WILL?

19:34.174 --> 19:35.606
It's OK, everypony.

19:38.477 --> 19:39.410
Ahem.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.547
First, I want to thank
all of you for coming.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.882
It means a lot that you'd
spend your hard earned bits

19:44.984 --> 19:46.117
just to be with us,

19:46.319 --> 19:48.152
but I honestly came
on this cruise

19:48.254 --> 19:50.555
to take some time off
from being a Princess.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.057
I'm just a pony too, after all.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.394
And even though I want
everypony here to be happy,

19:56.796 --> 19:59.263
I'd really like to spend
the rest of the cruise

19:59.565 --> 20:01.566
relaxing with my family.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.735
Of course, Princess Twilight!

20:04.837 --> 20:08.939
But why was this trip advertised
as a Cruise of the Princesses

20:09.041 --> 20:10.975
if you just wanted to get away?

20:12.312 --> 20:14.512
Iron Will's Cruise of the
Princesses makes no guarantees

20:14.614 --> 20:16.981
as to the participation
of actual princesses.

20:17.083 --> 20:17.648
What!?

20:20.220 --> 20:22.120
BUT, IRON WILL LEARNED
HIS LESSON BEFORE.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.654
SATISFACTION NOT GUARANTEED.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.890
NO REFUNDS.......!

20:31.997 --> 20:34.532
Wow. He may be pushy
and manipulative,

20:34.634 --> 20:38.169
but nopony can say that
Minotaur isn't prepared.

20:40.372 --> 20:41.906
There's still plenty
of activities.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.941
We pass Filly Delphia
on the way back;

20:44.043 --> 20:46.210
I could give Flurry Heart
a quick history tour!

20:46.312 --> 20:49.113
That's very thoughtful,
but right now,

20:49.315 --> 20:53.017
the family and I have
something scheduled for you.

20:53.319 --> 20:57.255
Behold the Northern Stars!

21:03.563 --> 21:05.431
You did all this for me?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.434
This is amazing! Thank you!

21:09.836 --> 21:12.370
And Shining Armor, I can't
believe you're up there

21:12.472 --> 21:13.938
even though you're air-sick.

21:14.440 --> 21:19.210
I am not-air--OK, maybe
I'm not feeling great.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.851
Now this is the only
activity I need.
