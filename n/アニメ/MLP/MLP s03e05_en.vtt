00:21.260 --> 00:24.440
May I help you, traveler?

00:25.690 --> 00:28.450
Something drew you to my shop...

00:28.600 --> 00:31.040
something powerful.

00:33.580 --> 00:36.240
Ah, you have a keen eye.

00:36.390 --> 00:39.490
The Alicorn Amulet
is one of the most mysterious

00:39.640 --> 00:43.340
and powerful
of all the known magical charms.

00:44.420 --> 00:48.460
I'm afraid this is...
far too dangerous.

00:51.540 --> 00:53.300
Would you like that gift-wrapped?

01:37.480 --> 01:41.970
Don't be scared, little friends.
Twilight is wonderful with magic.

01:42.770 --> 01:46.720
Anything happens to them, Twilight,
so help me.

01:46.870 --> 01:48.550
Aww, don't worry, Fluttershy,

01:48.700 --> 01:50.970
Twilight's magic has gotten a lot better
since she accidentally

01:51.120 --> 01:53.160
crushed me and Applejack
with a giant snowball.

01:54.790 --> 01:57.950
Of course she's good with magic.
Twilight's great with magic.

01:58.100 --> 02:00.330
I guess I just don't want
my little friends to be scared...

02:00.480 --> 02:02.690
Oh, oh, look how scared they are!

02:04.940 --> 02:07.920
I promise, Fluttershy,
nothing bad will happen to them.

02:08.070 --> 02:09.550
I know!

02:14.320 --> 02:17.270
Stop, stop!
They can't take it!

02:30.470 --> 02:32.160
Twilight, that looks amazing!

02:37.800 --> 02:39.460
That's all for now, little ones.

02:39.610 --> 02:43.170
Maybe we can practice again later,
if Fluttershy says it's alright.

02:45.350 --> 02:48.200
Your magic has really improved
since we came to Ponyville, Twilight.

02:48.350 --> 02:50.960
- Princess Celestia's gonna love it!
- Thanks, Spike.

02:51.110 --> 02:54.430
I have to be at my best when she arrives
with the delegates from Saddle Arabia.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.370
I can't believe she's trusting me
with the entertainment.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.260
Twilight! Come quick!
It's an emergency!

03:08.000 --> 03:12.550
You beast! This shade of brown
should only be used for accents!

03:13.680 --> 03:16.520
Come on, Applejack. We've got
to get her into a nice, soothing pink.

03:16.670 --> 03:17.550
STAT!

03:17.890 --> 03:20.900
- What's going on here?
- Well, well, well.

03:21.050 --> 03:24.930
If it isn't...
Twilight Sparkle.

03:26.090 --> 03:28.560
- Trixie!
- What's she doing here?

03:28.870 --> 03:32.090
You call that great and powerful?

03:37.330 --> 03:41.400
- Oh! She's Rainbow Wobble, now!
- Yeah!

03:44.840 --> 03:48.540
Good spell,
oh Great and Powerful Trixie!

03:48.690 --> 03:50.540
You two! Quiet!

03:53.080 --> 03:56.390
- What happened?
- Get off of me!

04:02.920 --> 04:05.080
Stop picking on my friends, Trixie!

04:05.230 --> 04:07.380
You and I
have some unfinished business.

04:07.510 --> 04:10.350
My magic's gotten better
since I was here last.

04:10.790 --> 04:12.360
And I'm going to prove it!

04:12.510 --> 04:15.220
Me and you.
A magic duel.

04:15.370 --> 04:20.400
Winner stays,
loser leaves Ponyville forever!

04:20.550 --> 04:23.520
Forget it!
I'd never make a deal like that!

04:24.234 --> 04:25.910
Your choice.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.450
Trixie, put him down.

04:36.930 --> 04:38.470
Why are you doing this?

04:38.620 --> 04:41.950
Why?
Because you humiliated me!

04:43.220 --> 04:46.760
After you showed me up
with that Ursa Minor,

04:46.910 --> 04:49.270
I became a laughingstock!

04:49.420 --> 04:53.260
Everywhere I went
I was laughed at and ostracized.

04:53.410 --> 04:57.760
I even had to take a job on a rock farm
just to earn a living!

04:58.280 --> 05:00.170
A rock farm!

05:00.320 --> 05:03.750
Hey! You're lucky a rock farm
would take the likes of you!

05:10.530 --> 05:12.930
Now I want revenge!

05:13.070 --> 05:16.070
And I'll just keep casting spells
'til you agree.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.580
Well?
What do you say?

05:27.520 --> 05:30.710
Alright, Trixie.
Let's duel!

05:31.100 --> 05:32.550
Excellent!

05:40.980 --> 05:43.930
If I lose,
I won't set hoof in Ponyville again.

05:44.080 --> 05:48.480
But if you lose, you're the one
banished from this one-horse town!

05:59.320 --> 06:00.840
Draw!

06:39.930 --> 06:42.530
Snips, Snails, step forward!

06:42.680 --> 06:46.540
What is it,
oh Great and P-P-Powerful Trixie ?

06:56.770 --> 07:00.970
An age spell?
But, how could you do an age spell?

07:01.120 --> 07:03.490
That's only for
the highest level unicorns!

07:04.330 --> 07:06.140
Well, Twilight?
Give up?

07:12.670 --> 07:14.730
Come on, Twilight.
You can do it!

07:26.680 --> 07:30.630
Trixie is the highest level unicorn!

07:33.480 --> 07:37.670
And now it's time for you
to leave Ponyville!

07:37.820 --> 07:39.550
FOREVER!

07:40.460 --> 07:42.340
That's enough, Trixie!

07:42.500 --> 07:43.770
You proved your point,

07:43.920 --> 07:46.770
but you can't possibly
expect Twilight to leave Ponyville!

07:46.920 --> 07:48.720
You fools.

07:48.870 --> 07:51.110
She's already gone.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.400
It's okay guys.
I'll figure something out.

08:08.550 --> 08:12.020
Just take care of each other.
And keep an eye on Trixie.

08:12.170 --> 08:14.150
There's something strange about her...

08:15.660 --> 08:17.000
Twilight?

08:30.940 --> 08:32.210
It's impossible!

08:32.360 --> 08:34.790
How could Trixie know
such advanced magic?

08:34.940 --> 08:38.640
Without Spike, I can't get a message
to the Princess in Saddle Arabia,

08:38.790 --> 08:42.390
so who else do I know who understands
strange and powerful magic?

08:46.400 --> 08:49.430
Your tale of woe upsets me so.

08:49.580 --> 08:52.870
No wonder you're dour,
it's an abuse of power!

08:53.140 --> 08:56.890
I don't know what to do, Zecora.
I feel like I've abandoned my friends.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.880
But I can't take her on horn-to-horn.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.570
If you train with me,
so good you'll be,

09:02.720 --> 09:06.010
I'll show you the way
to make sure she won't stay.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.940
You'll train me in magic?

09:08.090 --> 09:12.270
But she was doing age spells,
weather spells, you name it!

09:12.420 --> 09:14.590
When it comes to magic,
it would be tragic

09:14.740 --> 09:17.580
if somepony licked me,
especially Trixie.

09:17.730 --> 09:19.490
You really think I can beat her?

09:20.920 --> 09:23.510
Okay, when do we start?

09:28.840 --> 09:31.500
You two!
Hurry up with my throne.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.840
And you, how long do I have to wait
for my apple sauce facial?

09:36.990 --> 09:38.470
Forget it, Trixie.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.830
I ain't doing nothin'
'til you let Twilight come home.

09:45.910 --> 09:48.760
Okay, I'll do it, just make it stop!

09:53.200 --> 09:55.340
I thought I told you to dance!

10:02.210 --> 10:04.710
Trixie's cruel magic
is ruining Ponyville.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.870
Somepony has to help us!

10:18.680 --> 10:23.380
No noise, no sound,
no din, no fuss,

10:23.530 --> 10:26.400
must interfere with your focus.

10:26.550 --> 10:30.930
Unlearn what you have learned,
only then can victory be earned.

10:32.020 --> 10:35.940
<i>Trixie is the highest level unicorn!</i>

10:42.030 --> 10:44.340
There is much,
much that I can teach,

10:44.490 --> 10:47.830
but the answer you need
may still be out of reach.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.840
I'm sorry, Zecora.

10:49.990 --> 10:53.500
I'm trying my best, but...
I can't stop thinking about Trixie.

10:53.650 --> 10:55.680
There was something different
about her.

10:55.830 --> 10:58.800
It's like she's gone
from high and mighty to mean and nasty.

10:58.950 --> 11:04.060
Your thinking needs a readjust.
Total concentration is a must.

11:17.990 --> 11:20.790
This really doesn't seem
to be getting us anywhere.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.260
I hear you, Pinkie.

11:26.410 --> 11:29.550
I can't find anything that describes
the kind of magic Trixie's doin'.

11:29.700 --> 11:33.880
There must be something!
Twilight has every magic book there is!

11:34.030 --> 11:36.070
Um, I think I may have found something?

11:36.210 --> 11:39.010
Yes, it's time for us
to consider our futures

11:39.160 --> 11:41.490
in this new Trixie-led Ponyville.

11:41.640 --> 11:44.030
Um, this sounds an awful lot like
Trixie's magic--

11:44.180 --> 11:46.570
She wants me to grow apples
with no peels!

11:46.720 --> 11:48.780
How the hay am
I supposed to do that?

11:48.930 --> 11:51.130
Um, there's a picture here
of that necklace--

11:53.470 --> 11:55.120
It's called the Alicorn Amulet,

11:55.270 --> 11:56.840
and whoever wears it
is blessed with untold--

11:56.990 --> 11:58.240
Hey, everypony, look!

11:58.390 --> 12:00.240
This book has a picture
of Trixie's necklace!

12:00.390 --> 12:02.430
It's called the Alicorn Amulet,

12:02.580 --> 12:05.540
and whoever wears it
is blessed with untold powers!

12:05.690 --> 12:07.500
If you read a little further,
you'll see--

12:07.650 --> 12:12.070
Even though it provides great power,
it also corrupts the user!

12:12.220 --> 12:13.510
Yes, but, um, you can't--

12:13.660 --> 12:15.970
You can't just
take the Alicorn Amulet off her neck.

12:16.120 --> 12:19.730
It has a magical lock!
Trixie's the only pony who can take it off!

12:19.880 --> 12:20.460
Maybe--

12:20.610 --> 12:22.790
We need to get
this information to Twilight.

12:22.940 --> 12:24.670
- She'll know what to do.
- But, how--

12:24.820 --> 12:28.760
If any of us try to leave,
Trixie's magical forcefield will tell her!

12:28.910 --> 12:30.860
- Maybe we should--
- I've got it!

12:31.010 --> 12:34.140
Trying to sneak past the forcefield
would be impossible without help.

12:34.290 --> 12:37.400
But I know who's got the goods
to get into those woods!

12:38.240 --> 12:39.820
- Fluttershy!
-What?!

12:41.040 --> 12:43.950
What do you say, Fluttershy?
Can you handle the mission?

12:44.100 --> 12:47.490
No! I'll crack under the pressure,
I'll snap like a twig!

12:47.640 --> 12:51.240
Perfect! Fluttershy'll sneak out
of Ponyville and find Twilight.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.030
But I-- I--

13:00.550 --> 13:01.550
Okay.

13:04.540 --> 13:08.790
I know just the design
for a dangerous mission outfit!

13:14.550 --> 13:16.640
Pull, you fools!

13:17.830 --> 13:22.210
Somepony set off the magic forcefield,
and Trixie intends to punish them!

13:22.360 --> 13:26.560
But, wouldn't it be faster
if we had some... wheels?!

13:26.710 --> 13:29.290
The Great and Powerful Trixie
doesn't trust wheels.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.000
Now pull faster!

13:31.150 --> 13:35.740
I'm telling ya, Snips,
she's getting weirder and weirder!

13:39.890 --> 13:41.790
Stop!

13:41.940 --> 13:43.370
You there!
What are you doing?!

14:00.550 --> 14:03.190
Why is she so mean to us?

14:03.340 --> 14:07.620
Yeah! I miss the days
when she was just a fraud!

14:19.620 --> 14:20.711
Oh oh dear!

14:20.862 --> 14:22.860
Rarity's dangerous
mission outfit is ruined!

14:23.010 --> 14:24.390
Guess we'd better go back!

14:27.600 --> 14:31.310
Okay, okay, you're right,
I need to be brave and find Twilight.

14:31.820 --> 14:33.740
Oh! You found her?

14:33.890 --> 14:35.730
She's in the Everfree Forest?!

14:38.750 --> 14:43.330
Oh, this is me being brave!
I wanna be brave at home,

14:43.480 --> 14:46.740
locked in my closet,
with my teddy bear!

14:51.530 --> 14:54.340
I can't believe
I didn't recognize the Alicorn Amulet!

14:54.490 --> 14:57.360
The more she uses it,
the more it will corrupt her!

14:57.710 --> 14:59.800
But how am I supposed
to beat that amulet?

14:59.950 --> 15:01.590
My magic's not good enough!

15:01.740 --> 15:04.390
Twilight Sparkle,
much work have you done.

15:04.540 --> 15:07.590
You learned all of my lessons,
all but one.

15:08.020 --> 15:11.150
If Trixie's tricks have you in a fix,

15:11.300 --> 15:14.560
you must mix your magic
and use the six.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.020
Mix your magic, use the six...
mix your magic, use the six!

15:20.170 --> 15:23.520
Use the six, that's it!
Zecora, you're a genius!

15:25.010 --> 15:28.170
Now I need to get you back
inside Ponyville, Fluttershy.

15:38.420 --> 15:40.550
This better not be another false alarm,

15:40.800 --> 15:43.460
or the Great and Powerful Trixie will--

15:44.390 --> 15:45.940
You!

15:46.090 --> 15:49.780
What's the matter, Twilight Sparkle?
Not enjoying your exile?

15:49.930 --> 15:52.940
I know about the Alicorn Amulet.
I know you cheated.

15:53.090 --> 15:55.570
Cheated? Moi?

15:55.720 --> 15:57.660
Yeah. And I thought
you might wanna see

15:57.810 --> 15:59.860
what a real magical amulet looks like.

16:00.010 --> 16:01.570
Zecora gave it to me.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.570
It's from beyond the Everfree Forest,

16:03.720 --> 16:07.100
and it's way more powerful
than your measly Alicorn Amulet!

16:07.250 --> 16:11.000
Ha! Nothing's more powerful
than the Alicorn Amulet!

16:11.150 --> 16:16.220
And nopony's more powerful
than the Great and Powerful Trixie!

16:16.580 --> 16:19.090
Care to put your amulet
where your mouth is?

16:19.230 --> 16:20.600
How about another duel?

16:20.750 --> 16:22.830
Why should I?
I already beat you.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.510
That's up to you!
But I guess you'll never see

16:25.660 --> 16:29.130
the totally awesome magic
from beyond the Everfree Forest...

16:29.280 --> 16:30.560
Come on, Zecora.

16:31.920 --> 16:32.900
Wait!

16:37.390 --> 16:40.520
Okay, okay, you're on!
A second duel.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.590
Let's start with a simple age spell,
shall we?

16:53.740 --> 16:54.880
Let's.

16:55.030 --> 16:56.290
Snips, Snails.

17:03.630 --> 17:05.500
An oldie, but a goodie.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.790
Now let's see
what your little charm can do.

17:09.590 --> 17:11.070
No problem.

17:11.220 --> 17:14.530
Um, Applejack, Rarity?
Could you help me, please?

17:34.770 --> 17:36.930
So you can do an age spell,
big deal.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.580
That's... that's impossible!

17:53.730 --> 17:54.870
That's nothing!

18:06.920 --> 18:08.120
How did you--

18:08.270 --> 18:09.700
Duplication spell.

18:09.850 --> 18:12.610
Ever seen one pony
play ten instruments?

18:22.470 --> 18:24.480
This-- just can't be!

18:24.630 --> 18:28.970
Ooh, one more.
I can turn a mare into a stallion.

18:32.150 --> 18:34.060
Eeyup.

18:38.330 --> 18:42.140
Well, Trixie, looks like my amulet
is more powerful than yours.

18:42.290 --> 18:43.900
Hey! Give it back!

18:46.450 --> 18:49.880
With this amulet,
I shall now rule

18:50.030 --> 18:51.990
all of Equestria!

18:58.160 --> 19:00.280
Witness, my subjects,

19:00.430 --> 19:05.110
gaze upon an ever
greater and powerfuler Trixie!

19:10.030 --> 19:12.520
I don't need
that old Alicorn Amulet.

19:12.670 --> 19:14.610
I have this!

19:19.460 --> 19:23.110
Stop it!
Tha-that tickles!

19:23.260 --> 19:24.290
Tickles?

19:24.440 --> 19:26.780
That was supposed
to make you writhe in agony!

19:26.930 --> 19:28.560
This amulet is defective!

19:29.460 --> 19:30.660
Give mine back!

19:30.810 --> 19:34.290
Sorry. This is going back
into hiding where it belongs.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.540
By the way, Trixie,
the amulet around your neck?

19:37.690 --> 19:39.700
It's one of Zecora's doorstops.

19:40.180 --> 19:43.500
But...
how did you do those spells?

19:43.650 --> 19:45.470
Nopony can do those spells!

19:45.800 --> 19:48.320
You're right.
Not even me.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.730
<i>Zecora taught me so much about
magic while I was in exile.</i>

19:51.880 --> 19:54.280
<i>She even taught me
when not to use it.</i>

19:56.190 --> 20:00.560
<i>My magic alone wasn't powerful enough
to take on the Alicorn Amulet head to head,</i>

20:01.100 --> 20:03.670
<i>so I needed to use
a different kind of magic...</i>

20:03.820 --> 20:06.550
<i>the magic of friendship.</i>

20:06.700 --> 20:08.160
I also knew that the only pony

20:08.310 --> 20:10.500
who could get the amulet off
your neck was you.

20:10.650 --> 20:14.430
But what about
the pony with the ten instruments?

20:14.580 --> 20:17.370
That's not magic,
that was just Pinkie Pie.

20:47.470 --> 20:48.650
Trixie?

20:48.800 --> 20:50.780
It's the least I could do.

20:50.930 --> 20:55.200
I treated you and your friends so horribly
when I was wearing that Alicorn Amulet...

20:55.350 --> 20:57.510
I just couldn't control myself.

20:57.660 --> 21:01.330
You can forgive me, can't you?

21:04.820 --> 21:07.560
- Sure.
- Oh, great.

21:07.910 --> 21:11.010
Don't you think
the Great and Apologetic Trixie

21:11.160 --> 21:14.180
is the most magnificent humble pony
you have ever seen?
