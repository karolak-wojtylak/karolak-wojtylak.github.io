00:08.175 --> 00:10.676
Any minute now.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.808
Yee-haw!

00:16.107 --> 00:18.583
It's officially
apple bucking day!

00:19.065 --> 00:20.220
Look at all those apples!

00:20.316 --> 00:22.007
Ripe and juicy.

00:22.321 --> 00:23.432
Perfect for bucking!

00:34.515 --> 00:36.277
What the heck is going on?

00:37.629 --> 00:39.266
They're back!

01:22.446 --> 01:24.033
<i>Attention!</i>

01:24.388 --> 01:27.026
This is a Sweet
Apple Acres code red.

01:27.270 --> 01:31.223
I need all hooves
and claws on deck.

01:31.705 --> 01:33.408
Calm down, Applejack.

01:33.728 --> 01:34.743
Calm down?

01:34.967 --> 01:37.192
How can I calm down
at a time like this?

01:37.432 --> 01:39.535
Vampire fruit bats
are attacking

01:39.541 --> 01:40.997
Sweet Apple Acres!

01:41.332 --> 01:43.340
But I thought the fruit
bats usually stayed put

01:43.354 --> 01:44.415
in the West Orchard.

01:44.655 --> 01:45.990
The fruit bats do,

01:46.360 --> 01:49.299
but these aren't just your
everyday ordinary fruit bats.

01:49.773 --> 01:52.792
They're vampire
fruit bats.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.283
I'll be durned if they
think they're gonna sink

01:55.293 --> 01:57.200
their fangs into my
blue ribbon apple.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.644
Ooooh! Wow!

02:01.654 --> 02:02.770
Awesome!

02:02.825 --> 02:04.136
This here's our
entry into the

02:04.140 --> 02:06.435
Appaloosa State Fair's
Produce Competition.

02:07.190 --> 02:10.054
You know how much TLC goes
into gettin' an apple

02:10.066 --> 02:11.283
to grow like this?

02:11.402 --> 02:15.697
Applejack, when you go
big, you really go big.

02:16.417 --> 02:18.597
Them Vampire Bats
want to shrivel it up

02:18.604 --> 02:19.539
like a raisin.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.873
Ooh,I'm sure if we
just let them know

02:21.880 --> 02:24.040
how special that particular
apple is to you,

02:24.156 --> 02:25.330
they'll leave it alone.

02:25.428 --> 02:26.160
Yeah, right.

02:26.528 --> 02:27.711
Be my guest.

02:34.158 --> 02:37.073
Um, excuse me,
Mr. Vampire Bat.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.806
We were just wondering if,
maybe, you wouldn't mind

02:41.812 --> 02:43.365
leaving that really
big apple alone?

02:47.354 --> 02:48.608
Well, what did he say?

02:48.813 --> 02:50.279
Um, "yes".

02:50.636 --> 02:51.194
Huh?

02:51.350 --> 02:53.028
But it could
have been a "no".

02:53.192 --> 02:53.869
Oh.

02:54.037 --> 02:56.419
This is the first Vampire
Fruit Bat I've ever met

02:56.425 --> 02:59.192
and well, it might
take some time for me

02:59.200 --> 03:00.784
to really understand
their language.

03:01.555 --> 03:02.148
Uh-huh.

03:02.718 --> 03:05.797
And in the meantime, this
pest and his vermin friends

03:05.806 --> 03:08.156
are gonna go
after my prized apple,

03:08.167 --> 03:11.176
and while they're at it, every
other apple in the orchard.

03:11.330 --> 03:14.003
These Vampire Bats are
nothin' but a bunch of monsters.

03:14.187 --> 03:15.344
Monsters?

03:15.707 --> 03:18.680
Oh! That's a bit harsh,
don't you think?

03:18.835 --> 03:20.390
No, I do not.

05:40.669 --> 05:43.281
I'm sorry, Fluttershy,
but I believe Applejack

05:43.299 --> 05:44.798
has made the
better argument.

05:45.073 --> 05:48.536
These vampire fruit bats
sound downright dreadful.

05:48.844 --> 05:50.206
So let's get to
roundin' 'em up

05:50.214 --> 05:52.208
so that they don't destroy
the rest of my orchard.

05:52.782 --> 05:54.876
Fruit bat round up!
Fruit bat round up!

05:55.274 --> 05:59.385
Um, excuse me, but what if
instead of rounding them up,

05:59.875 --> 06:02.520
we let them have part
of the orchard.

06:03.834 --> 06:06.062
Have you lost your
pest-lovin' mind?

06:06.378 --> 06:08.560
They're only here
because they're hungry.

06:08.924 --> 06:10.680
If we built a
sanctuary for them,

06:10.911 --> 06:12.778
they could have their
own apples to enjoy.

06:13.016 --> 06:14.755
After a while, they
could even help

06:14.764 --> 06:16.232
the rest of your orchard.

06:16.544 --> 06:19.438
The Vampire bats don't eat
the seeds of the apples

06:19.440 --> 06:20.899
and when they
spit them out,

06:20.909 --> 06:24.156
they grow into even more
productive apple trees.

06:24.161 --> 06:27.617
Listen, Fluttershy, that
sounds real nice and all,

06:27.625 --> 06:28.938
but every second we spend

06:28.942 --> 06:31.018
buildin' this
so-called "sanctuary"

06:31.369 --> 06:33.719
is a second they'll spend
destroyin' orchard.

06:34.140 --> 06:35.424
You don't know
what it was like

06:35.434 --> 06:37.400
the last time there
was an infestation,

06:37.814 --> 06:40.312
but Granny Smith has told
me enough stories about it

06:40.480 --> 06:42.723
that just the thought of
it gives me nightmares.

06:45.525 --> 06:48.696
<i>Granny says we lost a huge</i>
<i>section of orchard that year.</i>

06:49.032 --> 06:51.322
<i>They had to ration</i>
<i>out apples all winter.</i>

06:52.593 --> 06:53.594
What about the cider?

06:53.873 --> 06:55.332
There was still
cider, right?

06:55.443 --> 06:56.245
Not

06:56.310 --> 06:56.977
a

06:57.028 --> 06:57.570
drop!

06:57.857 --> 06:58.563
No cider?

06:58.760 --> 07:00.173
No cider!

07:00.277 --> 07:01.894
We need to round up
these monsters

07:01.904 --> 07:03.531
and we need to do
it now!

07:03.996 --> 07:06.359
If Granny Smith wasn't
with Apple Bloom and Big Mac

07:06.364 --> 07:08.645
checkin' out our produce
competition in Appaloosa,

07:08.794 --> 07:11.203
she'd be here tellin'
us to do just that.

07:11.494 --> 07:14.388
I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but
I think Applejack is right.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.309
I just wish there was another
way we could convince them

07:17.311 --> 07:18.997
not to eat them in
the first place.

07:20.891 --> 07:22.532
Maybe there is.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.198
<i>So there's good news</i>
<i>and bad news.</i>

07:27.486 --> 07:29.073
The good news is that
I've found a spell

07:29.080 --> 07:30.495
that can get the
vampire fruit bats

07:30.501 --> 07:32.710
to stop wanting to suck
the juice from the apples.

07:32.913 --> 07:34.720
But in order for
the spell to work,

07:34.737 --> 07:37.570
I need the bats' full
and complete attention.

07:39.147 --> 07:39.769
Oh, no.

07:40.017 --> 07:43.180
Fluttershy, I need you to
do your stare on the bats.

07:43.428 --> 07:45.775
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.100
What's the problem?

07:47.385 --> 07:50.042
You've used the stare
plenty of times before.

07:50.544 --> 07:53.902
Yes, but it's not
something I take lightly;

07:54.163 --> 07:58.331
I've made a vow not to use it
except in dire circumstances.

07:58.651 --> 08:00.985
This circumstance is
plenty dire to me.

08:01.383 --> 08:02.359
Me, too!

08:02.963 --> 08:04.122
Think of the cider!

08:04.571 --> 08:08.181
Won't somepony please
think of the cider!

08:09.065 --> 08:12.339
I'm sorry, I just don't like
the idea of taking away

08:12.345 --> 08:14.862
the thing that really
makes the vampire fruit bats

08:15.360 --> 08:16.729
vampire fruit bats.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.024
It just feels wrong.

08:19.254 --> 08:21.650
But if we don't do this,
there won't be any apples

08:21.666 --> 08:23.549
left for anypony
here in Ponyville.

08:23.882 --> 08:25.525
Doesn't that
feel wrong, too?

08:34.035 --> 08:36.021
So what's it going
to be, Fluttershy?

08:36.292 --> 08:38.520
Will you do your stare
on the bats or not?

08:38.924 --> 08:40.757
Um, um...

08:41.867 --> 08:43.921
...OK, I'll do it.

08:44.165 --> 08:45.258
Good choice.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.550
I knew you wouldn't side
with those icky bats.

08:48.688 --> 08:49.547
Ewwww!

08:49.789 --> 08:51.112
They're not icky.

08:51.465 --> 08:53.479
First round of
cider's on me!

08:54.011 --> 08:55.309
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

08:55.797 --> 08:57.875
We gotta round up these
beasts with wings first.

08:58.152 --> 08:59.049
Time's a-wastin'!

09:31.084 --> 09:31.921
Got you!

09:48.167 --> 09:49.609
<i>Good work, everypony.</i>

09:49.613 --> 09:50.942
I think we got them all.

09:51.510 --> 09:54.078
Now all we need is for
you to do your stare.

09:54.429 --> 09:57.383
Um, are you sure I
really need...

09:59.155 --> 10:00.011
OK.

10:00.768 --> 10:04.193
I really, really, really
hate to do this to you.

10:04.606 --> 10:06.435
I just hope you
can forgive me.

10:17.162 --> 10:17.797
Good.

10:18.140 --> 10:19.775
Now you go, Twilight.

10:20.126 --> 10:20.975
All right.

10:38.218 --> 10:40.080
You can stop
staring, Fluttershy.

10:43.929 --> 10:44.940
Did it work?

10:45.250 --> 10:47.254
Only one way to
find out for sure.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.006
Whoo-ee!

10:55.182 --> 10:56.548
My crop is saved.

10:56.749 --> 10:57.998
Yee-haw!

10:58.007 --> 11:01.057
We'll be drinking
cider all winter long!

11:01.274 --> 11:02.640
I want to thank
you for your help.

11:02.922 --> 11:04.296
<i>I couldn't have</i>
<i>done it without you.</i>

11:04.634 --> 11:06.286
Don't mention
it, Applejack.

11:06.298 --> 11:07.857
It was my
pleasure, really.

11:09.319 --> 11:11.502
Now all we gotta do is
sweep up these cores

11:11.514 --> 11:13.701
so I can start bucking
fresh tomorrow morning.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.332
Apple bucking day, take 2.

11:27.303 --> 11:28.878
YEEHAW!

11:30.415 --> 11:33.047
Time to collect those
juicy sweet apples.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.514
The spell didn't work.

11:41.629 --> 11:43.516
You're durn tootin', the
spell didn't work.

11:43.730 --> 11:46.474
I think we're going to have to
take more extreme measures.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.005
I hear ya', Applejack.

11:48.214 --> 11:52.440
Come on, everypony, let's
track down those Vampire Bats!

12:03.455 --> 12:04.440
Wait a minute.

12:04.794 --> 12:06.630
I don't think these bats
are the ones that sucked

12:06.645 --> 12:07.810
my apples dry.

12:08.177 --> 12:11.030
But if the vampire bats
aren't eating your apples,

12:11.414 --> 12:12.357
who is?

12:12.917 --> 12:15.494
Fluttershy, you're
our animal expert.

12:15.654 --> 12:17.457
<i>Do you know of any other</i>
<i>creature that might be</i>

12:17.465 --> 12:18.476
<i>capable of this?</i>

12:18.995 --> 12:19.929
I'm sorry.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.258
I don't.

12:21.410 --> 12:23.100
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

12:23.404 --> 12:25.416
We'll have to catch
whoever it is in the act.

12:25.810 --> 12:27.615
And how do you
propose we do that?

12:28.197 --> 12:29.469
A stake-out.

12:34.076 --> 12:36.440
The witching hour.

12:39.619 --> 12:41.385
Maybe we should
just call this off.

12:41.771 --> 12:43.461
I'm not sure about the
rest of you guys

12:43.697 --> 12:46.626
but I'm really hungry.

12:53.584 --> 12:55.998
Oh, Fluttershy, it'll be OK.

12:56.230 --> 12:58.942
Don't forget, darling,
we're all in this together.

12:59.264 --> 13:00.136
That's right.

13:00.394 --> 13:03.379
Nopony leaves this orchard
until we solve this mystery.

13:03.888 --> 13:04.567
Agreed?

13:05.022 --> 13:05.849
Agreed!

13:07.256 --> 13:08.960
Does everypony have
their pony signal?

13:15.600 --> 13:18.333
Now remember Pinkie Pie,
only use the signal

13:18.343 --> 13:19.988
if you see something
suspicious.

13:20.353 --> 13:21.280
I got it.

13:21.399 --> 13:23.157
Something suspicious.

13:28.546 --> 13:29.369
Whatcha doin?

13:33.623 --> 13:35.361
All right, now
everypony split up.

13:35.853 --> 13:37.594
We'll each patrol our
own row of the orchard.

13:38.212 --> 13:41.221
Whoever or whatever is
destroying my apples

13:41.231 --> 13:42.903
has got to be
here somewhere.

13:49.666 --> 13:51.463
I have a bad
feeling about this,

13:51.668 --> 13:54.433
a really bad
feeling about this.

13:55.724 --> 14:02.493
That apple, it looks
so juicy and sweet.

14:09.820 --> 14:10.511
What was that?

14:15.319 --> 14:17.090
Suspicious! Hee hee!

14:17.159 --> 14:19.106
It's pony signal time!

14:25.256 --> 14:26.251
Who's there?

14:28.142 --> 14:31.656
Oh, well, there's
obviously no need to worry

14:31.668 --> 14:34.187
about that shadowy
figure overhead.

14:35.777 --> 14:36.643
Or maybe there is.

14:37.047 --> 14:38.936
I think I'll just go see
how Rainbow Dash is doing.

14:43.073 --> 14:43.621
Uh...

14:44.130 --> 14:45.104
Who's there?

14:49.598 --> 14:51.912
Answer me, or
you'll regret it!

14:53.385 --> 14:55.207
Fine. Have it your own way.

14:56.333 --> 14:59.172
Take that, you,
you, you...

15:00.197 --> 15:02.023
<i>You scarecrow.</i>

15:16.526 --> 15:17.982
Applejack, what is it?

15:21.373 --> 15:22.638
Suspicious!

15:35.783 --> 15:36.747
Fluttershy?

15:37.319 --> 15:38.470
Yooo-hoo!

15:38.684 --> 15:40.152
Fluttershy!

15:42.148 --> 15:44.275
That's not Flutter-shy.

15:44.673 --> 15:46.515
That's Flutter-bat.

15:46.688 --> 15:48.595
We've got to get
her down from there.

15:49.471 --> 15:52.464
Fluttershy sweetness,
please come down.

15:52.478 --> 15:54.766
And do stop being
a vampire bat.

15:58.852 --> 15:59.722
Fluttershy!

15:59.898 --> 16:01.477
It's me, Rainbow Dash.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.696
Why don't you cut the
bat act and come on down?

16:07.492 --> 16:08.222
Whoa!

16:08.901 --> 16:11.201
Maybe we should just let
her come down when she's ready.

16:14.489 --> 16:15.884
Flutterbat on the loose!

16:16.115 --> 16:18.573
Run for your lives!

16:19.055 --> 16:20.733
Pinkie Pie, calm down.

16:21.051 --> 16:23.756
See, she's back
on her...branch.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.674
<i>She's just biding her time.</i>

16:25.683 --> 16:27.428
Waiting for the
right moment to pounce!

16:27.666 --> 16:30.698
Pinkie Pie, bats
don't eat ponies.

16:31.041 --> 16:32.729
Not even vampire bats.

16:33.022 --> 16:36.647
But maybe vampire
ponies eat other ponies.

16:36.655 --> 16:38.398
I'm not taking
any chances.

16:40.294 --> 16:41.490
How did this happen?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.564
That's what I
don't understand.

16:43.738 --> 16:45.455
I think this was
actually our fault.

16:45.648 --> 16:46.626
Our fault?

16:46.866 --> 16:48.362
And how do you
figure that?

16:54.665 --> 16:57.535
<i>OK, so this is me;</i>
<i>these are the bats</i>

16:57.540 --> 16:59.914
<i>and this is Fluttershy</i>
<i>doing her stare.</i>

16:59.925 --> 17:01.260
<i>The spell was supposed to go</i>

17:01.272 --> 17:02.911
<i>right onto the bats like this.</i>

17:03.416 --> 17:05.348
<i>But somehow the spell</i>
<i>must have backfired.</i>

17:05.898 --> 17:09.440
It took the vampire fruit bats'
desire to be vampire fruit bats,

17:09.459 --> 17:12.009
<i>and transferred that</i>
<i>desire into Fluttershy.</i>

17:12.606 --> 17:15.332
C'mon! We'll reverse the
spell and make it right.

17:16.507 --> 17:18.015
Then what are
we waiting for?

17:18.199 --> 17:21.143
Let's save Fluttershy before
that thing eats us all!

17:22.981 --> 17:23.693
Hit the deck!

17:23.760 --> 17:24.817
Whoa!

17:25.865 --> 17:27.650
Follow that bat!

17:38.575 --> 17:40.659
I can't believe
we lost her.

17:40.971 --> 17:43.063
Oh Fluttershy,
where are you?

17:56.144 --> 17:56.764
Look out!

18:00.556 --> 18:04.029
If she keeps this up, your whole
crop will be gone in no time.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.849
That's the least
of my worries.

18:06.446 --> 18:08.146
I just want my
friend back.

18:08.448 --> 18:10.304
We'll never get her back
unless we corner her

18:10.312 --> 18:12.109
and catch her so I can
reverse the spell.

18:22.466 --> 18:23.344
There she is.

18:25.607 --> 18:26.667
There she goes!

18:26.762 --> 18:28.468
Oh, this is no use.

18:28.478 --> 18:30.251
I think the only way we're
going to catch her

18:30.263 --> 18:32.548
is if we find a way to
lure her closer to us.

18:32.835 --> 18:34.889
But even if we can
lure her to us,

18:35.096 --> 18:37.129
how are we going to get
her to stay still long enough

18:37.133 --> 18:38.938
for you to do
your reverse spell?

18:39.151 --> 18:42.033
Oooh! If only we had
Fluttershy to do her stare

18:42.040 --> 18:43.233
on the Flutterbat.

18:43.291 --> 18:44.618
That's it!

18:50.788 --> 18:53.004
OK, let's get
our friend back.

18:53.018 --> 18:54.407
Action stations!

18:56.462 --> 18:58.277
So much for having
the winning apple

18:58.286 --> 19:00.273
in the Appaloosa
State Fair, huh?

19:16.796 --> 19:18.001
She's coming!

19:53.010 --> 19:55.205
Uh, where am I?

19:58.575 --> 20:00.325
Thank goodness you're OK!

20:00.626 --> 20:02.819
But what happened to me?

20:03.451 --> 20:05.229
You turned into
a vampire pony!

20:05.820 --> 20:07.301
I tried to eat ponies?

20:07.438 --> 20:08.881
Of course not.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.526
So I wasn't a vampire?

20:10.883 --> 20:11.480
Yes!

20:11.521 --> 20:12.185
"Yes," I was?

20:12.415 --> 20:13.572
Or "Yes," I wasn't?

20:13.746 --> 20:15.063
Yes, you were!

20:15.075 --> 20:17.120
But I didn't try
to eat ponies?

20:17.137 --> 20:17.707
Yes!

20:17.791 --> 20:18.444
I did?

20:18.591 --> 20:19.203
No.

20:19.303 --> 20:20.618
I'm confused.

20:20.776 --> 20:23.397
Me too, and I was there.

20:30.692 --> 20:33.754
Fluttershy, I'm real sorry I
didn't take your suggestion

20:33.767 --> 20:35.045
in the first place.

20:35.652 --> 20:38.011
And don't forget; now
you'll get seeds that will

20:38.029 --> 20:41.512
grow into even bigger
and better apple trees.

20:41.849 --> 20:44.905
Does that mean what
I think it means?

20:45.268 --> 20:47.559
Yep. More cider, too.

20:48.091 --> 20:49.486
Ha ha! Wow!

20:51.397 --> 20:53.832
<i>OK. Got the part</i>
<i>about the spell.</i>

20:53.847 --> 20:55.404
<i>Fluttershy turning</i>
<i>into a bat.</i>

20:55.412 --> 20:56.782
Building the sanctuary.

20:56.790 --> 20:59.061
Be sure to put in there
that I came to see that my

20:59.071 --> 21:02.491
short-term solution was
a little short-sighted.

21:02.509 --> 21:04.762
And that you shouldn't let
anypony pressure you

21:04.770 --> 21:07.207
into doing something you
don't think is right.

21:07.211 --> 21:10.973
Sometimes you have to tell
even your closest friends, "no".

21:12.003 --> 21:13.746
<i>Now how 'bout</i>
<i>we celebrate our</i>

21:13.752 --> 21:18.052
stronger-than-ever friendship
with a nice, ripe juicy apple?

21:19.047 --> 21:20.083
Stand back!

21:20.093 --> 21:23.336
I vant to suck its juice!
