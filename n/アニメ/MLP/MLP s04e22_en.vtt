WEBVTT

00:04.811 --> 00:06.495
<i>Yes!</i>

00:06.854 --> 00:08.052
<i>Best day ever!</i>

00:08.612 --> 00:11.443
<i>We're all going to the Rainbow</i>
<i>Falls Traders Exchange.</i>

00:15.045 --> 00:16.146
And not just going.

00:16.308 --> 00:19.974
We're accompanying a princess
on an official royal duty.

00:20.792 --> 00:22.645
Please. It's not that
big of a deal.

00:23.422 --> 00:25.713
There always has to be a
princess at the Exchange.

00:26.076 --> 00:27.687
Last year it was
Princess Cadance.

00:27.953 --> 00:28.901
This year it's me.

00:29.168 --> 00:30.624
It's just a formality.

00:30.995 --> 00:32.347
I'm sure none of
the other ponies

00:32.353 --> 00:33.652
will even notice I'm here.

00:34.204 --> 00:34.946
<i>Look over there!</i>

00:35.008 --> 00:36.148
<i>The Princess!</i>

00:36.963 --> 00:38.076
<i>This is amazing!</i>

00:39.621 --> 00:42.794
Could be wrong, but I think
they might've noticed.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.350
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu</i>

01:27.625 --> 01:28.952
Oh my goodness!

01:29.024 --> 01:29.951
<i>You said it!</i>

01:30.052 --> 01:32.967
The Rainbow Falls Traders
Exchange is simply divine.

01:33.328 --> 01:35.123
You can get anything
you want here.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.449
If'n you got the
goods to trade for it.

01:41.036 --> 01:41.471
Whoa!

01:42.509 --> 01:43.416
No!

01:45.711 --> 01:46.950
Thanks, Twilight. Phew!

01:47.324 --> 01:50.357
One ding, nick or dent and this
Power Ponies comic book

01:50.417 --> 01:52.279
wouldn't be in perfect mint
condition anymore.

01:52.556 --> 01:54.819
And if you want to
trade for a mint comic,

01:54.989 --> 01:56.663
you've gotta have a mint comic.

02:02.392 --> 02:05.143
I guess a pony who's here on
official princess business

02:05.340 --> 02:07.681
has to expect a little fussin'.

02:08.241 --> 02:10.160
But all I'm supposed to do
is settle disagreements

02:10.206 --> 02:11.974
over whether a trade
is fair or not.

02:12.126 --> 02:13.871
<i>And since the rule is</i>
<i>that a trade is fair</i>

02:13.884 --> 02:15.683
<i>as long as both ponies</i>
<i>get what they want,</i>

02:15.994 --> 02:17.393
<i>there's never been a</i>
<i>disagreement.</i>

02:17.711 --> 02:19.514
So there's really no
reason for anypony

02:19.521 --> 02:21.120
to treat me as
anything special.

02:22.702 --> 02:24.200
Hi, can I help you?

02:28.679 --> 02:31.106
There's a pony here who's got
a signed, first edition

02:31.114 --> 02:33.545
of Daring Do and the Quest
of the Sapphire Statue.

02:33.685 --> 02:35.112
And I'm gonna get it!

02:35.330 --> 02:37.201
I've been able to get first
editions of all the

02:37.213 --> 02:39.057
Daring Do books except this one.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.281
No pony's ever put
together a whole set.

02:41.479 --> 02:43.237
And I'm gonna be the first!

02:43.477 --> 02:44.928
If it hasn't been traded yet.

02:45.184 --> 02:46.913
It's the only one
in all of Equestria.

02:47.358 --> 02:50.620
Oh no! I'd really hate to
see you disappointed.

02:50.958 --> 02:53.092
<i>I did want to trade this</i>
<i>bear call I brought</i>

02:53.198 --> 02:54.485
<i>for a bird whistle.</i>

02:54.741 --> 02:57.235
But getting that book
seems so important to you.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.447
So if you need me
to help you first...

02:59.521 --> 03:01.309
Normally, I'd say I
don't need any help.

03:01.451 --> 03:03.719
But you're right: This
is really important.

03:03.996 --> 03:05.410
I've gotta get that book!

03:06.973 --> 03:09.800
Well, I'm off to take a gander
at some of the vintage stalls.

03:10.421 --> 03:11.726
Did you say vintage?

03:13.545 --> 03:16.829
Why, old and rare items
are so in style right now.

03:17.014 --> 03:19.036
I'm hoping to get a
vintage item as well.

03:19.422 --> 03:21.912
I just hope I brought
enough to trade.

03:22.187 --> 03:23.607
I know what you mean, Rarity.

03:24.478 --> 03:27.615
Hey, why don't we pool
our trade stashes?

03:27.894 --> 03:28.536
Pool?

03:28.800 --> 03:31.231
That way, if one of us finds
something real valuable

03:31.289 --> 03:32.497
she can't live without...

03:33.443 --> 03:35.761
She'll definitely
be able to get it.

03:36.222 --> 03:38.491
Who could say no to
exchanging a single object

03:38.532 --> 03:40.400
for such a huge
assortment of items?

03:40.577 --> 03:43.313
Oh, yes, that is
absolutely brilliant.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.070
I'm so glad I have a
friend like you, Applejack.

03:46.571 --> 03:47.935
I feel the same way.

03:48.241 --> 03:50.729
Then let's go shopping!

03:55.613 --> 03:57.799
Um, shouldn't Your
Princessness be heading

03:57.804 --> 03:59.211
to the royal box seats?

03:59.576 --> 04:02.702
I may be the princess on duty,
but I don't think that means

04:02.714 --> 04:04.971
I have to sit up there
all alone doing nothing.

04:05.354 --> 04:08.197
Ever since I became a princess,
Celestia has been sending me

04:08.206 --> 04:09.639
more books to read than ever.

04:09.820 --> 04:11.309
<i>The library is overflowing.</i>

04:11.313 --> 04:13.006
So I figured
while we're here.

04:13.383 --> 04:15.719
I might as well trade away some
books I don't need any more.

04:16.050 --> 04:16.860
Mm hm!

04:19.611 --> 04:21.693
There it is!

04:21.826 --> 04:24.800
The first edition of Daring
Do and the Sapphire Statue!

04:24.876 --> 04:26.643
It hasn't been traded yet!

04:26.903 --> 04:28.400
Lucky for you.

04:28.552 --> 04:30.995
Because I've brought my
most valuable possession

04:31.061 --> 04:32.247
to trade for it:

04:33.470 --> 04:35.449
<i>My lucky horse shoe.</i>

04:36.546 --> 04:37.400
I don't want it.

04:38.238 --> 04:38.932
What?

04:39.201 --> 04:41.149
It's just a rusty
old horse shoe.

04:41.211 --> 04:43.121
That's not worth
anything to me.

04:43.551 --> 04:47.904
But how is Rainbow Dash going to
get the book she really wants?

04:48.840 --> 04:49.732
Well, she's not.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.511
Unless ...

04:53.363 --> 04:54.958
she can get me that.

04:59.761 --> 05:01.449
Ooh, an Orthros.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.852
<i>How cute.</i>

05:04.204 --> 05:06.138
The pony running the
Ancient Beast Stall

05:06.142 --> 05:07.822
doesn't want
anything I got.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.985
But if you can get
me the Orthros,

05:11.356 --> 05:13.200
I'll trade you
the book for it.

05:14.942 --> 05:16.099
You got it!

05:17.908 --> 05:21.504
I don't know how, but somehow
we're gonna get that Orthros.

05:27.674 --> 05:28.476
Oh, Applejack!

05:28.669 --> 05:30.333
I am so glad I found you.

05:30.439 --> 05:32.372
Me, too. You're not
gonna believe it.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.131
I found a super valuable vintage
item I just have to have.

05:35.145 --> 05:36.993
And all it's going to
cost is all our stuff!

05:37.960 --> 05:38.718
Uh-oh.

05:41.385 --> 05:44.749
So where is this
valuable vintage item

05:44.757 --> 05:47.129
you want to trade
everything we have for?

05:47.769 --> 05:48.405
There.

05:50.394 --> 05:51.004
Where?

05:51.211 --> 05:52.064
Right there.

05:53.451 --> 05:56.093
But that's a dented
old pie tin.

05:56.345 --> 05:58.534
A dented vintage pie tin.

05:58.751 --> 06:01.295
The metal they used to fashion
this one helps cook the pies

06:01.303 --> 06:03.100
up to five seconds faster.

06:03.336 --> 06:05.024
<i>They don't make 'em</i>
<i>like this anymore.</i>

06:05.715 --> 06:08.595
I am so glad you showed
that to me, darling.

06:09.877 --> 06:11.440
Because once you
see what I found,

06:11.547 --> 06:13.898
you won't want to waste
our trade goods on that.

06:15.303 --> 06:18.158
<i>Just look at this</i>
<i>gorgeous vintage brooch.</i>

06:18.398 --> 06:19.879
It's one of a kind.

06:22.072 --> 06:24.837
It looks exactly like the
one you're already wearing.

06:25.268 --> 06:27.079
Well, yes, they
may look the same.

06:27.143 --> 06:28.323
But I know it's older.

06:28.390 --> 06:30.505
That's what makes it
so much more divine.

06:30.967 --> 06:32.690
But that doesn't
make a lick of sense.

06:32.913 --> 06:34.739
Why I wager if I
switched 'em up,

06:34.827 --> 06:36.540
you wouldn't even
know the difference.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.600
Oh, don't be silly;
of course I would.

06:46.470 --> 06:48.759
So which is the vintage one?

06:50.224 --> 06:51.756
That one, of course.

06:52.936 --> 06:54.156
Ha! You're bluffin'.

06:54.503 --> 06:55.471
Am I?

06:55.652 --> 06:56.762
How can you tell?

06:57.143 --> 06:58.487
Well, because...

06:58.880 --> 07:00.427
Agh! I can't.

07:00.614 --> 07:02.710
'Cause the one you want to
waste our whole stash on

07:02.835 --> 07:05.028
is exactly the same as
the one you already got.

07:05.315 --> 07:07.477
There's no way anypony
would notice the difference.

07:08.741 --> 07:10.954
I'd say it's a lot more
likely they'd notice that

07:11.246 --> 07:13.186
than some dented tin
that cooked a pie

07:13.198 --> 07:15.278
a whole two
seconds faster.

07:15.410 --> 07:17.668
It's five
seconds faster!

07:36.878 --> 07:39.508
Yes, such a good
two-headed boy.

07:39.514 --> 07:40.760
Yes you are.

07:42.864 --> 07:43.754
Stop that!

07:43.857 --> 07:45.970
Come on! Don't you
start now, too.

07:49.414 --> 07:52.411
OK, I can see you're busy, so
I'll give it to you straight.

07:52.716 --> 07:55.406
I need to trade this
horse shoe for ...that.

07:56.620 --> 07:57.336
Nope.

07:59.843 --> 08:00.544
Down boy!

08:00.745 --> 08:01.750
Watch out for the lamp.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.853
Well, I could use
another lamp.

08:10.530 --> 08:13.726
<i>A whole stand filled with</i>
<i>Discord-shaped lamps?</i>

08:14.078 --> 08:15.235
Seriously?

08:15.689 --> 08:19.137
They really do have everything
at the Traders Exchange.

08:19.637 --> 08:21.098
Will you trade a lamp
for my horse shoe,

08:21.102 --> 08:22.960
so I can trade it for an
Orthros and get my book?

08:23.752 --> 08:24.212
No.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.701
But I'd trade it for
an antique chicken.

08:28.101 --> 08:28.710
Great!

08:30.290 --> 08:31.898
What's an antique chicken?

08:33.268 --> 08:36.374
Oh, I got all kinds of
antique chicken statues:

08:36.667 --> 08:39.711
I got your Blue Hens,
Speckled Greys, your...

08:39.720 --> 08:40.417
OK, cool.

08:40.550 --> 08:42.241
So will you trade
one for a horse shoe,

08:42.250 --> 08:44.349
so I can trade it for a lamp and
<i>then trade it for an Orthros</i>

08:44.357 --> 08:45.514
<i>so I can get my book?</i>

08:46.973 --> 08:48.934
Well, let me think.

08:49.207 --> 08:50.640
Uh, no.

08:52.327 --> 08:55.775
But I'd gladly trade one of my
chickens for a crystal chalice.

08:59.178 --> 09:00.033
Hang on a sec.

09:01.779 --> 09:03.346
<i>We need a crystal chalice</i>
<i>to trade for a chicken</i>

09:03.354 --> 09:05.313
<i>to trade for a lamp to</i>
<i>trade for an Orthros.</i>

09:05.486 --> 09:07.598
So what are you
willing to trade for?

09:07.886 --> 09:09.986
I'm guessing it's gotta
be some crazy thing

09:09.992 --> 09:11.880
way across the Exchange.

09:12.095 --> 09:15.342
Actually, I could use a
slightly rusty old horse shoe.

09:16.411 --> 09:18.571
Yeah, but where am
I gonna find...wait!

09:18.718 --> 09:19.935
I've got one of those!

09:21.822 --> 09:24.407
Now that we've got the chalice,
this is gonna be a cinch.

09:24.585 --> 09:25.640
Do you really think so?

09:25.886 --> 09:28.062
All we gotta do is bring this
thing to the chicken stand

09:28.187 --> 09:29.055
and we are--

09:34.934 --> 09:37.779
You want me to trade all
my books for a broken pen?

09:40.478 --> 09:42.460
All right fine, you got
yourself a dea--

09:42.470 --> 09:43.974
Stop! What are you doing?

09:44.277 --> 09:47.336
I was trying to get rid of all
the books I don't need anymore.

09:47.730 --> 09:48.421
For that?

09:48.692 --> 09:51.619
Do you really want that?

09:52.501 --> 09:54.074
Well, not really.

09:54.140 --> 09:56.526
But I'm running out of
library space, so-

09:56.530 --> 09:57.949
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!

09:57.996 --> 09:59.172
I can't believe that
almost happened.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.940
But luckily it didn't happen.

10:01.073 --> 10:01.699
Thanks to me.

10:01.945 --> 10:02.950
What are you talking about?

10:03.767 --> 10:05.381
According to the
rules of the Exchange,

10:05.393 --> 10:07.309
a trade is only fair
if both ponies end up

10:07.315 --> 10:08.370
with something they want.

10:08.743 --> 10:10.540
You can't break
the rules.

10:11.510 --> 10:12.604
Did anypony see you do it?

10:12.671 --> 10:13.644
I don't think anypony saw.

10:15.982 --> 10:18.167
But you're not going to
say anything, are you?

10:18.413 --> 10:19.342
Just kidding.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.234
Or am I?

10:20.376 --> 10:21.637
Sometimes I can't
even tell...

10:23.836 --> 10:25.600
You know, if you
want to go check out

10:25.637 --> 10:28.080
the rest of the Exchange and
trade whatever you brought...

10:28.480 --> 10:30.452
Nope. I just came
to pony watch.

10:30.606 --> 10:32.058
I'm not going anywhere.

10:32.364 --> 10:34.216
I won't let you make a
mistake like that again.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.394
Hey, Everypony!

10:38.433 --> 10:39.260
Step right up.

10:39.428 --> 10:40.206
Do not walk.

10:40.474 --> 10:43.324
Gallop over here for your
chance to trade for authentic,

10:43.373 --> 10:46.413
one-of-a-kind, official
princess merchandise!

10:53.118 --> 10:54.630
Well, that took forever.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.630
I just hope it looks OK.

11:01.752 --> 11:03.319
This is perfect!

11:06.214 --> 11:09.028
Perfect for the broken
chalice mosaic I'm making.

11:09.533 --> 11:12.296
All right, so what kind of
antique chicken do you want?

11:12.792 --> 11:14.942
<i>I got speckled, brown, grey...</i>

11:14.987 --> 11:15.625
Oh, no!

11:15.832 --> 11:17.824
The pony we're supposed to
trade the chicken statue to

11:17.834 --> 11:19.274
didn't tell us what
kind he wanted.

11:19.754 --> 11:21.340
OK, look, I'm fast.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.262
I'll fly over to the
lamp stand and find out

11:23.272 --> 11:24.218
what kind of
chicken he wants.

11:24.630 --> 11:28.279
Just don't let anypony trade for
any chicken while I'm gone, OK?

11:28.737 --> 11:30.538
Um, well, OK.

11:30.786 --> 11:31.951
Um, I can do that.

11:32.097 --> 11:32.696
I think.

11:36.185 --> 11:39.157
Uh, well, maybe you
shouldn't get one of those.

11:41.207 --> 11:43.157
You know, unless
you really want to.

11:48.874 --> 11:49.594
Beat it!

11:51.711 --> 11:52.243
You go.

11:52.355 --> 11:53.096
I'll stay here.

11:55.121 --> 11:57.412
Well, since we can't
both get what we want,

11:57.732 --> 11:58.958
I will be the
better friend.

11:59.164 --> 12:01.791
You take our trade goods
and get what you want.

12:02.197 --> 12:03.553
I'm an amazin' friend.

12:03.947 --> 12:06.005
So even though it's fer
somethin' that don't seem

12:06.015 --> 12:08.532
valuable at all,
you take our stash.

12:08.733 --> 12:10.575
How dare you let
me get what I want?

12:10.680 --> 12:12.530
What kind of friend
do you think I am?

12:12.661 --> 12:14.444
You're going to
get what you want.

12:14.628 --> 12:15.644
No, you are.

12:15.730 --> 12:16.815
No, you are.

12:20.111 --> 12:20.999
Hello?

12:23.324 --> 12:25.239
We got the kind of
chicken you asked for.

12:25.564 --> 12:26.257
<i>Hello?</i>

12:27.449 --> 12:29.375
<i>Where's the pony</i>
<i>running this joint?</i>

12:30.161 --> 12:31.479
On break?

12:34.979 --> 12:37.970
These books made Twilight
the princess she is.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.990
Before that, she was nothing.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.079
Big fat zero.

12:41.301 --> 12:41.763
Hey!

12:41.955 --> 12:44.111
Then she read these
books and voila!

12:44.376 --> 12:45.707
Princess!

12:45.795 --> 12:48.037
So who wants to
start the bidding?

12:48.294 --> 12:48.858
Me!

12:50.042 --> 12:50.653
Me first!

12:52.973 --> 12:54.539
Just a moment, please.

12:54.971 --> 12:57.112
Pinkie, I appreciate
your help and all.

12:57.432 --> 12:59.252
But I'm not sure I'm
comfortable with this.

12:59.471 --> 13:01.065
No pony should
trade for my books

13:01.088 --> 13:02.538
just because I'm a princess.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.819
<i>I'm not better</i>
<i>than anypony else.</i>

13:06.216 --> 13:08.444
I know you're not
better than everypony.

13:08.628 --> 13:09.836
Just leave this to me.

13:10.048 --> 13:13.293
Did I mention that Princess
Twilight got these books

13:13.371 --> 13:15.959
from Princess Celestia?

13:16.220 --> 13:17.309
Whoa, wait!

13:17.506 --> 13:18.359
You don't mean?

13:18.384 --> 13:22.117
Oh, that's right:
double Princess.

13:32.413 --> 13:33.385
There he is!

13:35.215 --> 13:37.020
Look, I know it's
your break and all,

13:37.098 --> 13:38.419
but you've got to
open your stand

13:38.452 --> 13:39.748
so we can trade
you for a lamp.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.539
Sorry, girls.

13:43.799 --> 13:44.786
Been trading all day.

13:45.014 --> 13:47.588
My belly's telling me it's
time to eat an oat burger.

13:48.273 --> 13:49.400
Oh, come on.

13:49.436 --> 13:50.899
Please?

13:50.930 --> 13:52.425
Pretty, pretty please?

13:54.109 --> 13:56.489
Sorry. Belly
says "no."

13:57.830 --> 14:00.146
But the Exchange
ends at sundown.

14:00.803 --> 14:01.346
No!

14:06.887 --> 14:08.040
I've got an idea.

14:13.933 --> 14:14.439
Next.

14:25.674 --> 14:26.140
Next!

14:27.426 --> 14:28.005
Next!

14:29.426 --> 14:29.880
Next!

14:31.176 --> 14:31.668
Next!

14:41.416 --> 14:42.731
We're home free!

14:45.640 --> 14:48.271
As long as this thing
doesn't drown us in slobber.

14:49.043 --> 14:51.763
Oh, he's just an affectionate
little two-headed fellow,

14:51.884 --> 14:53.285
aren't you, little boy?

14:57.408 --> 15:00.476
No, I insist you go
fetch what you want.

15:00.852 --> 15:03.849
Cause that's the kind of
tried-and-true friend I am.

15:04.530 --> 15:08.522
Well! I am way too generous to
let you out-friend me like that.

15:17.205 --> 15:18.304
We've got to hurry.

15:31.869 --> 15:33.715
We're never going to get
to the Daring Do stand

15:33.746 --> 15:34.995
through this crowd in time.

15:46.021 --> 15:46.739
Come on!

15:50.483 --> 15:51.584
My bear call.

15:53.182 --> 15:54.156
We've got to go.

15:55.988 --> 15:56.641
Of course.

15:56.721 --> 15:57.945
It's just a bear call.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.841
There's nothing I
could've traded it for

15:59.857 --> 16:02.021
that's more valuable
to me than you.

16:06.204 --> 16:10.039
OK, the Exchange is almost
over, but we did it.

16:10.439 --> 16:13.363
We traded a crystal chalice
for an antique chicken.

16:13.697 --> 16:15.172
And the chicken for a lamp.

16:15.336 --> 16:18.872
And the lamp for an Orthros,
just like you asked.

16:20.505 --> 16:21.531
So here you go.

16:21.896 --> 16:22.839
Now where's my book?

16:23.814 --> 16:29.149
Yeah, you know, the thing is, I
don't want an Orthros anymore.

16:31.266 --> 16:31.859
But...

16:32.483 --> 16:33.886
What do we do now?

16:42.388 --> 16:43.789
Oh goodness.
Oh goodness!

16:44.698 --> 16:45.270
Agh!

16:47.697 --> 16:48.858
Good boys.

16:49.631 --> 16:52.160
Hey! You said you
wanted an Orthros!

16:52.394 --> 16:55.248
I've been watching that thing
over in the Ancient Beast Booth.

16:55.309 --> 16:58.565
It's crazy. I don't
want one in my house.

17:00.183 --> 17:02.778
There, there; that's
a good Orthros.

17:03.213 --> 17:04.782
You just have to know
how to treat them.

17:05.006 --> 17:07.744
With a little patient training
and a big slobber mop,

17:07.996 --> 17:10.240
they can be a wonderful
household pet.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.458
All right, all right.

17:16.706 --> 17:17.812
I'll trade you.

17:19.808 --> 17:20.755
Yes!

17:24.310 --> 17:27.184
<i>If she comes and stays</i>
<i>with us in Manehattan</i>

17:27.190 --> 17:28.419
<i>until it's trained.</i>

17:28.427 --> 17:31.873
Gosh. Training an Orthros
takes a long time.

17:32.415 --> 17:34.466
I'll probably be gone
from Ponyville for...

17:34.788 --> 17:36.778
I don't even know
how many moons.

17:39.484 --> 17:42.466
But if that is what
you really want.

17:42.889 --> 17:44.277
So we got a fair deal?

17:44.394 --> 17:45.761
Of course, it's a deal!

17:45.959 --> 17:46.790
Yeah ha ha!

17:49.900 --> 17:51.488
I did it! I did it!

17:52.298 --> 17:54.039
Fluttershy, can you
believe it?

17:58.985 --> 17:59.795
Oh, no!

18:00.134 --> 18:01.840
What did I do?

18:02.825 --> 18:04.751
<i>Who's got something</i>
<i>valuable enough to trade</i>

18:04.813 --> 18:07.172
for Princess Twilight's
princess books

18:07.182 --> 18:09.313
that she got from
Princess Celestia?

18:09.500 --> 18:10.376
Did I say princess?

18:10.817 --> 18:12.331
Over here,
over here!

18:13.317 --> 18:14.569
Oh, come on.

18:14.868 --> 18:17.338
These are the books the princess
would sit up with all night,

18:17.586 --> 18:20.766
with nothing to read by but
the light of her own horn.

18:21.529 --> 18:23.080
Ooh, now that looks fun.

18:23.289 --> 18:24.130
But not fun enough.

18:24.548 --> 18:27.998
These are the books that made
Twilight the princess she is.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.233
<i>So who's got what it</i>
<i>takes to trade for them?</i>

18:31.950 --> 18:33.717
When you put it
like that...

18:34.963 --> 18:36.200
Wait! Stop.
Come back!

18:36.856 --> 18:38.776
These books aren't that great.

18:38.981 --> 18:40.255
Oh, yes they are.

18:40.585 --> 18:42.089
But I thought you wanted
to get rid of them.

18:42.327 --> 18:44.499
None of those ponies had
anything valuable enough

18:44.503 --> 18:45.720
to trade for my books.

18:45.976 --> 18:48.247
Not because these books
belonged to a princess.

18:48.580 --> 18:51.500
But because they helped make me
who I am, just like you said.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.349
This is the one I was
so absorbed in

18:54.351 --> 18:57.182
the day Spike decided he
owed Applejack a life debt.

18:57.982 --> 19:00.249
And this one reminds
me of the day I got it,

19:00.474 --> 19:01.830
which was the day I met you.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.431
I may not ever need
to read these again,

19:04.675 --> 19:06.641
but that doesn't mean
they don't have value.

19:07.082 --> 19:09.754
I realize that now,
thanks to you, Pinkie.

19:10.212 --> 19:11.914
I told you I'd take
care of everything.

19:12.056 --> 19:12.757
Twilight!

19:12.846 --> 19:14.499
I need you to say a
trade wasn't fair.

19:14.645 --> 19:15.492
Fast!

19:17.038 --> 19:18.727
I've heard what you
both have to say.

19:18.930 --> 19:20.398
<i>And I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.</i>

19:20.751 --> 19:22.001
But my hooves are tied.

19:22.181 --> 19:23.773
You said it was a fair trade.

19:25.375 --> 19:26.337
Yeah, I said it.

19:26.667 --> 19:27.939
But I was wrong.

19:28.132 --> 19:30.035
I did want that book. A lot.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.052
I said I wanted it
more than anything

19:32.060 --> 19:33.268
<i>in all of Equestria.</i>

19:33.691 --> 19:36.979
But there's no thing that's
worth as much to me as a friend.

19:38.538 --> 19:42.046
I might've forgotten that for
a little bit, but it's true.

19:42.401 --> 19:45.315
Which means there's no way
this trade can be fair.

19:46.673 --> 19:48.212
Oh, come on; that's...

19:49.697 --> 19:52.515
the sweetest thing I've ever heard.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.541
OK, the trade's off.

20:03.043 --> 20:05.354
And with that, I
declare this trial

20:05.496 --> 20:09.131
and this year's Rainbow Falls
Traders Exchange over.

20:10.113 --> 20:11.412
Whoo hoo!

20:26.774 --> 20:29.079
<i>I know it's not the pie tin</i>
<i>you were after.</i>

20:29.490 --> 20:30.655
But I hope you like it.

20:31.057 --> 20:33.486
It's the rustiest piece
of junk I could get.

20:34.550 --> 20:37.799
Well, I took my half of
our stash and got you this.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.528
Ooooh!

20:40.624 --> 20:42.253
<i>And I know you're</i>
<i>gonna love it</i>

20:42.501 --> 20:43.752
cause you already
have a bunch a ones

20:43.769 --> 20:45.069
that look exactly the same

20:45.112 --> 20:46.476
sittin' in a drawer
doin' nothing.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.416
So that should settle
once and for all

20:49.428 --> 20:51.014
which of us is the
better friend.

20:51.256 --> 20:52.376
Oh, come on!

20:52.778 --> 20:55.660
You both gave up what you wanted
to do something for each other.

20:56.095 --> 20:57.978
That's the coolest
thing a friend can do.

20:58.163 --> 20:59.551
Trust me, I know.

21:01.266 --> 21:02.977
Hey, where's your
double doggie?

21:03.426 --> 21:05.746
I traded it for
something way better.

21:11.756 --> 21:12.913
Well, what do you know?

21:13.057 --> 21:15.758
My copy of Daring Do
and the Sapphire Statue.

21:16.140 --> 21:18.042
It's just a beat
up old paperback,

21:18.243 --> 21:20.491
not a one-of-a-kind
first edition.

21:21.393 --> 21:22.464
Even better!

21:22.788 --> 21:26.704
Because I can read this
one with all my friends.
