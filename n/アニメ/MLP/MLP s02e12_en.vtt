00:11.778 --> 00:14.648
The timber wolves are a-howlin'!

00:14.998 --> 00:17.694
The timber wolves are a-howlin'!

00:20.541 --> 00:21.544
Eyup.

00:22.005 --> 00:23.323
The Zap Apples are comin'!

00:23.573 --> 00:25.300
The Zap Apples are comin'!

00:26.130 --> 00:26.889
Yay!

00:27.239 --> 00:28.794
The Zap Apples are comin'!

00:29.431 --> 00:30.777
That's what I said.

01:10.221 --> 01:11.377
Hey, silly goose!

01:11.527 --> 01:13.764
Quit your gawkin' and move your caboose!

01:21.674 --> 01:22.719
Ready, Granny!

01:24.133 --> 01:25.245
Ready for what?

01:25.395 --> 01:27.390
For makin' Zap Apple Jam!

01:27.540 --> 01:28.671
Darn tootin'!

01:28.821 --> 01:32.812
It's time for some good old-fashioned
Zap Apple Jammin'!

01:32.962 --> 01:34.587
Yes mam, I can't wait mam!

01:37.142 --> 01:38.112
Wait for what?

01:38.262 --> 01:40.403
To make Zap Apple Jam with you!

01:40.553 --> 01:41.446
Of course!

01:41.596 --> 01:44.668
Now I been doing this
ever since I was a little pony.

01:44.818 --> 01:48.903
So be warned, pickle pear,
there's a whole mess steps in this process

01:49.053 --> 01:51.372
and you got to get
each one of them just right.

01:51.522 --> 01:53.958
Or no Zap Apple Jam.

01:54.108 --> 01:55.345
Take this.

01:55.495 --> 01:59.380
Is this one of your gazillion secret herbal
ingredients for the Zap Apple Jam?

02:00.683 --> 02:01.892
That there's a broom.

02:02.042 --> 02:03.843
Now get sweepin', pipsqueak!

02:04.212 --> 02:06.740
Now while you sweep, I'll get to...

02:09.840 --> 02:11.224
Oh ponyfeathers!

02:11.374 --> 02:14.232
Bet I'd forget my mane if
it wasn't attached to my head.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.583
There's the Zap Apple leaves.

02:35.733 --> 02:36.942
Right on schedule!

02:52.143 --> 02:55.394
Well, howdy-doo there, Filthy Rich!

02:55.544 --> 02:56.895
Hello, Mrs. Smith.

02:57.045 --> 03:01.109
Did I hear right that there's a
Zap Apple harvest coming in a few days?

03:01.259 --> 03:03.486
Four days, to be exact.

03:03.636 --> 03:04.971
Excellent news!

03:05.121 --> 03:08.074
And as usual,
I get your first hundred jars?

03:08.224 --> 03:09.560
'Course, Filthy.

03:09.710 --> 03:11.263
I prefer Rich?

03:14.348 --> 03:16.778
Oh, you poor, poor thing...

03:16.928 --> 03:20.375
Having to make all that
Zap Apple Jam with Granny Smith.

03:22.490 --> 03:26.759
Actually, I been looking forward to
making Zap Apple Jam for years!

03:26.909 --> 03:30.513
I'm not talking about the jam,
I'm talking about Granny Smith!

03:30.953 --> 03:33.754
You must be sooo embarassed.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.531
What do ya mean?

03:37.681 --> 03:42.119
You know, with all her silly ways,
how she forgets things,

03:42.270 --> 03:45.043
and makes you wear
these ridiculous costumes?

03:45.199 --> 03:46.930
Granny said that the water needs-

03:47.080 --> 03:49.072
Thank goodness
you're here on the farm

03:49.222 --> 03:52.156
and not in town where
everypony could see you.

03:52.306 --> 03:54.710
Don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

03:55.353 --> 03:56.726
"Silly ways"?

03:58.733 --> 04:01.117
Thank you kindly, Filthy!

04:04.555 --> 04:06.484
Shake a leg there, slowpoke!

04:06.634 --> 04:09.778
We got a gaggle's worth of goods
to gather before the harvest.

04:09.928 --> 04:11.137
Come on!

04:11.446 --> 04:13.968
Gonna make Zap Apple Jam, oopsie ooh!

04:14.118 --> 04:16.072
Gatherin' the goodies now, oopdie hee!

04:23.632 --> 04:25.695
They don't make 'em like they used to.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.246
Hey, you bite it, you buy it!

04:44.278 --> 04:47.798
Why hello bees, Beatrice, Beecher!

04:47.948 --> 04:51.219
You've all been busy little bees,
haven't you?

04:53.839 --> 04:58.569
Granny, isn't there a less silly way
to get the honey?

05:03.494 --> 05:05.947
Isn't this just precious?

05:06.097 --> 05:07.385
Please stop!

05:07.535 --> 05:11.214
And it is perfect for makin'
our Zap Apple Jam!

05:12.306 --> 05:13.672
Stop it, Granny!

05:14.767 --> 05:16.059
Granny, please!

05:16.209 --> 05:18.424
Those ponies over there are watchin' me!

05:18.813 --> 05:21.871
What? Are those fillies your friends?

05:22.021 --> 05:24.710
Hello, Half-pint's friends!

05:24.860 --> 05:26.968
Hi, Granny Smith!

05:27.118 --> 05:29.590
Hi, Half-pint!

05:32.258 --> 05:33.533
What dolls.

05:33.683 --> 05:37.502
Why, when I was little,
ponies didn't come that purdy.

05:37.652 --> 05:39.235
Are we done shopping, Granny?

05:39.385 --> 05:41.589
'Cause I'd like to get back
to the farm, fast.

05:41.739 --> 05:43.312
Hold on, snellybelly.

05:51.667 --> 05:54.573
And by capturing
the whole sale market,

05:54.723 --> 05:57.433
purchasing in bulk
and slashing all prices,

05:57.583 --> 06:00.830
we undermine every other
gift market in town.

06:00.980 --> 06:03.691
And that's how Rich's
Barnyard Bargains

06:03.841 --> 06:06.863
became the cornerstone
of retail in Ponyville.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.697
Well, thank you, Mr. Filthy-

06:11.847 --> 06:13.604
I mean, Mr. Rich.

06:13.754 --> 06:15.631
What a wonderful day of sharing!

06:15.781 --> 06:19.432
And thank you for being a part of
Family Appreciation Day!

06:20.916 --> 06:23.410
Now, let's see who will be
bringing in a family member

06:23.560 --> 06:26.124
for next Monday's
Family Appreciation Day...

06:27.397 --> 06:28.673
Apple Bloom!

06:28.978 --> 06:32.738
But Miss Cheerilee,
Monday is Zap Apple harvest day!

06:32.888 --> 06:36.365
And Applejack and Big Macintosh
will be too busy to come and speak.

06:36.515 --> 06:39.618
Well, is there anypony else
in your family that could-

06:40.289 --> 06:41.585
Miss Cheerilee!

06:41.735 --> 06:44.729
Apple Bloom's Granny Smith
isn't working harvest...

06:45.034 --> 06:46.778
She could come.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.270
Oh! But, uh, no, that wouldn't-

06:49.420 --> 06:52.340
That's a splendid idea,
Diamond Tiara!

06:52.490 --> 06:55.851
Apple Bloom, you shall bring in
Granny Smith on Monday.

06:57.495 --> 06:59.481
Have a great weekend,
everypony!

07:00.920 --> 07:02.478
Granny Smith?

07:03.012 --> 07:04.037
Come Monday?

07:04.187 --> 07:07.056
I'll be the laughing stock of Ponyville!

07:15.076 --> 07:16.755
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom.

07:16.905 --> 07:19.401
I already told you that we just
can't take a break from harvest

07:19.552 --> 07:20.552
to come to your school.

07:20.845 --> 07:22.502
You know what'll happen.

07:22.652 --> 07:23.703
I know...

07:23.853 --> 07:27.123
After the fifth day,
the Zap Apples disappear...

07:38.864 --> 07:41.022
Look! The third sign!

07:41.979 --> 07:43.428
Right on time!

07:44.118 --> 07:45.678
Hot diggity!

07:58.083 --> 08:01.129
Alright, you lazy daisies,
move your caboose!

08:03.011 --> 08:05.474
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom,
but don't you fret.

08:05.624 --> 08:09.202
Granny Smith's got no shortage
of entertainin' stories to tell.

08:09.352 --> 08:12.191
I know. That's what
I'm worried about...

08:15.905 --> 08:17.124
I'll be embarrassed,

08:17.274 --> 08:18.342
shamed,

08:18.492 --> 08:19.530
disgraced,

08:19.680 --> 08:20.688
mortified,

08:20.838 --> 08:21.998
humiliate-

08:22.490 --> 08:24.221
What are you, a dictionary?

08:24.371 --> 08:26.780
Snap out of it,
we're here to help you!

08:26.930 --> 08:29.847
After all, we are
the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

08:29.997 --> 08:32.558
We'll figure out a way
to postpone your presentation.

08:33.523 --> 08:34.853
But how?

08:36.095 --> 08:38.940
All this worry is makin' me sick!

08:39.893 --> 08:40.983
Sick?

08:42.802 --> 08:43.868
That's it!

08:44.387 --> 08:45.416
C'mon!

08:48.225 --> 08:49.424
Ten-hut!

08:50.264 --> 08:52.250
Now listen here, troops!

08:52.400 --> 08:56.950
I don't want any whinin', or cryin',
or crackin' under pressure!

08:57.100 --> 08:59.086
Do I make myself clear?

09:01.771 --> 09:02.948
Court-martial!

09:08.224 --> 09:11.058
Stay still, Apple Bloom!
You have to look sick!

09:16.127 --> 09:17.645
Hey, this is hot!

09:17.795 --> 09:20.606
What in the hayseed is going on
in there, silly billy?

09:23.007 --> 09:25.127
Oh, Granny Smith!

09:25.277 --> 09:28.058
We were just about to come get you!

09:28.208 --> 09:29.655
Apple Bloom's sick!

09:29.805 --> 09:33.066
Looks like she may have
to stay home all week!

09:38.691 --> 09:40.680
Perfect as a Piccadilly pear!

09:41.617 --> 09:43.078
Now what?

09:45.092 --> 09:47.175
It's already almost sundown!

09:47.325 --> 09:48.926
Tomorrow is Sunday

09:49.076 --> 09:51.626
and I only have one more day
to figure something out!

09:51.776 --> 09:53.181
Hey! Look!

09:57.501 --> 09:59.200
That's the fourth sign!

10:11.662 --> 10:13.635
The Zap Apples have appeared!

10:13.785 --> 10:16.194
And that gives me an idea!

10:23.846 --> 10:28.674
We can't move Family Appreciation Day,
so let's move harvest day instead!

10:28.824 --> 10:31.511
They don't look... quite ripe.

10:31.661 --> 10:33.858
Harvesting apples early
never hurt an apple.

10:34.008 --> 10:34.940
I don't know...

10:35.090 --> 10:38.351
Zap Apple trees aren't like
normal apple trees.

10:38.501 --> 10:39.685
They're magic.

10:40.128 --> 10:41.813
How different can they be?

10:48.864 --> 10:51.781
Well if we can't buck 'em,
let's just pick 'em!

11:10.269 --> 11:12.492
Any other bright ideas?

11:15.388 --> 11:16.430
Granny Smith,

11:16.580 --> 11:18.069
it's Miss Cheerilee!

11:18.219 --> 11:20.209
Apple Bloom said you wanted
to speak with me?

11:24.327 --> 11:25.439
Hello?

11:25.589 --> 11:26.607
Granny Smi-

11:27.811 --> 11:30.736
Well hello there! Howdydoo!

11:31.518 --> 11:33.490
Hi... Granny Smith.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.616
Is everything okay?

11:35.766 --> 11:38.953
Of course it is!
Why wouldn't it be?

11:45.776 --> 11:47.263
Excuse me.

11:47.413 --> 11:49.955
Pickles always give me the hiccups!

11:53.492 --> 11:58.649
I need to tell you that I can't make
the presentation on Monday after all!

11:59.165 --> 12:01.294
Oh no, is that so?

12:01.709 --> 12:03.278
No doubts about it!

12:03.428 --> 12:06.981
I gotta shear the flowers
and water the sheep!

12:07.131 --> 12:08.149
I mean...

12:08.299 --> 12:11.402
I have to water the flowers
and shear the sheep!

12:12.255 --> 12:13.465
That's too bad.

12:13.615 --> 12:14.906
We can reschedule.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.191
Where am I?

12:21.512 --> 12:24.040
Well howdy, Miss Cheerilee!

12:24.190 --> 12:25.872
You window shopping?

12:26.994 --> 12:30.005
No, you asked me to come here

12:30.150 --> 12:34.300
to tell me that you wouldn't be making it
to Family Appreciation Day?

12:34.450 --> 12:35.651
Fiddlesticks!

12:35.801 --> 12:39.221
I wouldn't miss it
for all the tea in Canterlot!

12:39.520 --> 12:41.381
But, didn't you just say...

12:41.531 --> 12:42.569
See you Monday!

12:49.131 --> 12:52.165
I can't believe she woke up
from her nap.

12:52.843 --> 12:55.239
She never wakes up from her nap!

12:55.389 --> 12:58.597
I wish I could just run off and hide!

12:59.765 --> 13:01.989
Well, you can't run off...

13:02.534 --> 13:05.433
But maybe somepony else can!

13:31.065 --> 13:33.692
The Zap Apple harvest has begun!

13:35.803 --> 13:39.615
And tomorrow we'll be making up
some Zap Apple Jam!

13:41.058 --> 13:43.322
Miss Granny Smith?
Telegram.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.456
Well, bust my buttons.

13:47.606 --> 13:50.751
Uncle Apple Strudel wants me
to pay him a visit.

13:50.901 --> 13:52.922
And you can just make the 8am train.

13:53.072 --> 13:54.612
I already packed you a bag!

13:54.762 --> 13:56.882
Well that was considerate.

13:57.032 --> 13:58.868
But don't you worry, flibbertigibbet!

13:59.018 --> 14:01.762
I'll be back in time to make that jam!

14:03.001 --> 14:05.418
That train ride takes all day.

14:05.568 --> 14:06.911
I'm safe.

14:08.627 --> 14:10.855
For today's Family Appreciation Day,

14:11.005 --> 14:13.590
we are pleased
to welcome Granny Smith.

14:16.269 --> 14:18.645
Apple Bloom?
Is Granny Smith here?

14:18.795 --> 14:21.518
I'm sorry, Miss Cheerilee,

14:21.668 --> 14:26.017
but she got called out of town
on account of a family emergency...

14:26.167 --> 14:28.882
Well howdy, my little ponies!

14:34.930 --> 14:36.353
Howdy, y'all!

14:36.503 --> 14:39.940
I'm as happy as a pig
in a fresh mudpile to be here!

14:41.502 --> 14:43.778
What are you doing here?

14:43.928 --> 14:45.367
Did you miss the train?

14:45.517 --> 14:47.490
No, it came.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.540
And Uncle Apple Strudel was on it.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.788
Ooooooh, noogie noogie noggie!

14:54.636 --> 14:58.701
I can't wait to hear
Granny Smith's presentation...

14:58.851 --> 15:00.700
If she can remember any of it.

15:05.127 --> 15:08.302
Long ago, when I was a little pony,

15:09.596 --> 15:12.874
things were very different
here in Ponyville.

15:13.024 --> 15:17.508
'Cause there was no Ponyville!

15:18.675 --> 15:21.107
<i>That's right, my little ponies.</i>

15:21.257 --> 15:25.861
<i>Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk
back when I was a little filly.</i>

15:26.011 --> 15:28.322
<i>We ventured far and wide,</i>

15:28.472 --> 15:30.712
<i>collecting new seeds
and sellin' them on.</i>

15:30.862 --> 15:35.454
<i>But my pa was the finest seed collector
in all of Equestria.</i>

15:35.604 --> 15:40.033
<i>Then, one day, the Smith family
found themselves in the most brilliant,</i>

15:40.183 --> 15:43.364
<i>most grand, most magnificent
of all cities.</i>

15:43.514 --> 15:45.321
<i>A place called...</i>

15:46.313 --> 15:47.479
<i>Canterlot.</i>

15:47.992 --> 15:49.977
<i>Why, I bet your hooves to hindquarters that</i>

15:50.127 --> 15:52.952
<i>I had never seen anything like it
before nor since.</i>

15:53.497 --> 15:56.433
<i>And as if the beauty of
that city wasn't enough,</i>

15:56.583 --> 15:59.036
<i>suddenly, she appeared.</i>

15:59.186 --> 16:00.688
<i>Princess Celestia.</i>

16:00.979 --> 16:03.412
<i>The most regal of all ponies.</i>

16:03.562 --> 16:05.293
<i>When lo and behold,</i>

16:05.801 --> 16:09.738
<i>she stopped and look at
my pa's seed collection.</i>

16:09.888 --> 16:13.078
<i>Then Princess Celestia saw that
we were plumb-tuckered</i>

16:13.228 --> 16:15.494
<i>and hankerin' to find
our forever home.</i>

16:15.644 --> 16:17.945
<i>And bein' a royal Princess and all,</i>

16:18.095 --> 16:22.005
<i>she knew exactly the place for us
to lay down our stakes.</i>

16:22.155 --> 16:25.045
<i>My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks.</i>

16:26.864 --> 16:29.728
<i>We quickly found that land
near the Everfree Forest,</i>

16:29.878 --> 16:32.178
<i>and we built our first home.</i>

16:32.328 --> 16:34.602
<i>Next, we planted our first orchards.</i>

16:35.347 --> 16:37.391
<i>But an orchard don't grow overnight,</i>

16:37.541 --> 16:40.186
<i>and we were getting
mighty short on food.</i>

16:43.987 --> 16:46.222
<i>Now mind you, we were
cautioned about the forest,</i>

16:46.372 --> 16:48.527
<i>and we knew that
it was not fit to enter.</i>

16:50.143 --> 16:52.628
<i>But I knew there was
critters livin' there,</i>

16:52.778 --> 16:54.972
<i>so there must be somethin' to eat.</i>

16:55.122 --> 16:56.934
<i>It was dark and musty,</i>

16:57.084 --> 16:59.587
<i>and I won't lie, it was scary.</i>

16:59.737 --> 17:02.625
<i>But every inch was covered in plant life.</i>

17:02.775 --> 17:04.710
<i>And before I knew it,
wasn't I standin'</i>

17:04.860 --> 17:07.212
<i>in front of the most incredible...</i>

17:07.821 --> 17:09.585
<i>apple trees!</i>

17:10.512 --> 17:15.095
<i>I had never seen anything before
this kind of colorful fruit!</i>

17:15.245 --> 17:18.355
<i>I started picking apples,
quick as a whip!</i>

17:29.414 --> 17:31.695
<i>I turned, and there before me stood...</i>

17:32.367 --> 17:33.884
<i>the timber wolves!</i>

17:37.226 --> 17:39.411
<i>I'd never run so fast in my life.</i>

17:40.564 --> 17:43.332
<i>I did the only thing I could think of.</i>

17:57.162 --> 17:59.765
<i>My pa and I planted
those special apple seeds</i>

17:59.915 --> 18:02.434
<i>and before our eyes
they grew like wildfire.</i>

18:05.201 --> 18:09.241
<i>Well, we had full grown trees faster
than you could say lickety split.</i>

18:10.099 --> 18:12.557
<i>Then each year,
I paid close attention to</i>

18:12.707 --> 18:15.489
<i>the signs of the Zap Apple
special harvesting times.</i>

18:15.639 --> 18:18.158
<i>How the weather affects
the Everfree Forest,</i>

18:18.308 --> 18:22.094
<i>how the timber wolves howl when
the Zap Apples first start growing,</i>

18:22.244 --> 18:25.958
<i>and how they zapped away if
you didn't pick 'em all in one day!</i>

18:26.108 --> 18:30.296
<i>And the fruits of our labor were
the best fruit we ever tasted.</i>

18:30.446 --> 18:34.008
<i>Soon enough I was mixing up
batches of Zap Apple Jam.</i>

18:34.158 --> 18:37.259
<i>Just like harvestin' the Zap Apples
had its special rules,</i>

18:37.409 --> 18:40.118
<i>so did makin' Zap Apple Jam!</i>

18:40.268 --> 18:43.352
<i>I learned that you gotta be
extra friendly with the bees,</i>

18:43.502 --> 18:47.701
<i>otherwise their honey won't taste rightly
sweet to mix in with the Zap Apples.</i>

18:48.399 --> 18:51.854
<i>Who'd'a thought that glass jars
needed talking to?</i>

18:53.135 --> 18:56.447
<i>Or that Zap Apples
like pink polka dots?</i>

18:56.597 --> 19:00.026
<i>But magic is as magic does.
Just funny that way.</i>

19:00.434 --> 19:03.871
<i>Then ponies started comin' to
our farm from far and wide,</i>

19:04.021 --> 19:06.413
<i>just to get a taste
of my Zap Apple Jam.</i>

19:06.563 --> 19:09.097
<i>Some of them decided to stay,
like Stinkin' Rich,</i>

19:09.247 --> 19:11.211
<i>Diamond Tiara's great grandfather.</i>

19:11.539 --> 19:14.495
<i>Matter of fact,
the first thing he ever sold</i>

19:14.645 --> 19:16.532
<i>was my Zap Apple Jam.</i>

19:17.369 --> 19:20.588
<i>And before we knew it,
we had ourselves a nice little town.</i>

19:20.738 --> 19:23.049
<i>Bustling with all kinds of ponies.</i>

19:25.535 --> 19:28.570
<i>And that is how Ponyville was founded.</i>

19:43.633 --> 19:45.571
Thank you kindly, little ponies.

19:45.721 --> 19:48.582
Now now, let's settle down.

19:48.732 --> 19:50.927
So if it weren't for you
and the Zap Apples,

19:51.078 --> 19:52.700
Ponyville wouldn't even exist?!

19:52.971 --> 19:54.546
Darn tootin', little filly!

19:54.696 --> 19:56.700
If it weren't for my Granny Smith,

19:56.850 --> 19:59.538
your daddy wouldn't have
Barnyard Bargains.

20:03.729 --> 20:04.765
But-

20:07.084 --> 20:10.498
But she's just a... kooky old lady!

20:11.546 --> 20:13.690
She is not a kooky old lady!

20:13.840 --> 20:17.111
She is the most amazing pony
in all of Ponyville!

20:36.455 --> 20:39.967
I think this is the best
Zap Apple Jam I've tasted yet!

20:40.117 --> 20:43.596
Must because YOU had something
to do with it, Apple Bloom.

20:44.095 --> 20:45.233
You betcha.

20:45.383 --> 20:49.098
Apple Bloom is one humdinger
of a Zap Apple Jammer!

20:49.248 --> 20:50.445
I am?

20:50.595 --> 20:53.714
So I take it
Family Appreciation Day went well?

20:53.864 --> 20:57.612
Did it? My Granny Smith
is super special!

20:58.419 --> 21:01.083
I just forgot that for a little while.

21:01.233 --> 21:04.474
Aw, don't fret.
I forget things all the time.

21:04.624 --> 21:06.613
Now, I'll getcha...

21:08.113 --> 21:09.274
somethin'.

21:12.937 --> 21:15.488
Who wants to help Granny
sing to the water?

21:15.638 --> 21:16.900
We do, we do!

21:23.327 --> 21:24.812
Diamond Tiara?

21:25.634 --> 21:27.158
But dad!
