WEBVTT

00:02.333 --> 00:03.996
Attention, everypony!

00:03.997 --> 00:05.416
ATTENTION!

00:05.417 --> 00:08.219
The official Rainbow Dash
fan club will come to order.

00:08.220 --> 00:11.051
Let's get right down to our
first order of business.

00:11.052 --> 00:16.007
I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared
the most awesome pony in Ponyville.

00:16.008 --> 00:17.491
I second the motion.

00:17.492 --> 00:21.354
And might I add that if you looked up
the word "awesome" in the dictionary...

00:21.355 --> 00:23.527
...there would be
a picture of Rainbow Dash.

00:25.122 --> 00:26.728
I object!

00:28.150 --> 00:30.582
I think the word
"awesome" is played out.

00:30.583 --> 00:32.602
Rainbow Dash deserves better.

00:32.603 --> 00:37.097
I motion that we declare her
the most stupendous pony!

00:37.098 --> 00:39.864
"Stupendous"?
Is that the best you got?

00:39.865 --> 00:42.267
I motion that we declare her...

00:42.268 --> 00:43.745
...wonderrific!

00:43.746 --> 00:46.294
-Astonishing!
-Breathtaking!

00:46.295 --> 00:48.992
-Astounding!
-Bedazzling!

00:48.993 --> 00:51.731
What about superultraextremawesomeazing?

00:54.461 --> 00:57.995
All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash
the most superultraextra...

00:57.996 --> 01:02.299
...uh, whatever you said,
pony in all of Ponyville, say aye.

01:02.300 --> 01:03.558
AYE!

01:51.899 --> 01:54.692
What a beautiful day.

01:55.267 --> 02:00.216
There's nothing like a dip in the clouds
to make a pegasus feel super-relaxed.

02:00.217 --> 02:02.182
Help! Help!

02:02.878 --> 02:04.706
Help! Heeelp!

02:05.042 --> 02:07.986
Looks like my sky swim
will have to wait.

02:10.622 --> 02:13.672
I'm Rainbow Dash
and I'm here to rescue you!

02:22.364 --> 02:25.011
Wow. What's with this crowd?

02:25.012 --> 02:27.046
Uh... Thanks everypony.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.961
It was really no big deal.

02:28.962 --> 02:33.077
To me it was.
You're my hero, Rainbow Dash!

02:38.790 --> 02:41.455
That Rainbow Dash sure is something.

02:41.456 --> 02:44.176
Something special.

03:22.719 --> 03:25.397
Oh no! There's something
wrong with the baby!

03:27.581 --> 03:32.109
She's not cheering for everypony's
favorite hero: Rainbow Dash!

03:45.286 --> 03:47.666
There just aren't enough
words in the dictionary...

03:47.667 --> 03:50.447
...to describe Rainbow
Dash's awesomeness.

03:50.448 --> 03:52.636
I can think of a few new words.

03:52.637 --> 03:55.500
And I bet "modest" is not one of them.

04:01.038 --> 04:04.031
No, but she is kinda awesome.

04:16.019 --> 04:19.841
Never fear, your friendly neighborhood
Rainbow Dash is here!

04:31.896 --> 04:35.693
-We'd be lost without you!
-You're our hero, Rainbow Dash!

04:35.694 --> 04:38.707
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!

04:38.708 --> 04:41.269
I can't hear you!

04:41.270 --> 04:44.343
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!

04:44.344 --> 04:51.795
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!

04:52.011 --> 04:54.625
Call me silly, but I think
this whole hero thing...

04:54.626 --> 04:56.543
...might be going
to Rainbow Dash's head.

04:56.743 --> 04:59.121
You may be right... silly.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.592
And then I zoomed into the well.

05:03.593 --> 05:07.528
I knew it would be dark and dangerous,
but I didn't let that stop me.

05:07.529 --> 05:11.414
Danger's my middle name:
Rainbow Danger Dash.

05:11.415 --> 05:15.415
Thinking back on it, I acted pretty
awesomely heroic that day.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.782
"...that day."

05:16.783 --> 05:20.581
Awesomely heroic that day and
awesomely arrogant ever since.

05:21.918 --> 05:26.059
Hey, Applejack! How'd you like
to be immortalized as my friend?

05:26.060 --> 05:27.357
Immorta-what?

05:30.256 --> 05:32.037
Are you taking notes?

05:32.038 --> 05:34.715
Yep! I've been hoof-picked
by Rainbow Dash herself...

05:34.716 --> 05:36.501
...to write her autobiography.

05:36.502 --> 05:41.062
Um... Autobiographies are supposed to
be written by the pony they are about.

05:41.063 --> 05:44.091
Maybe for your normal,
run-of-the-mill ponies.

05:44.092 --> 05:47.701
But I'm far too busy saving
lives to stop and write.

05:47.702 --> 05:50.215
That's why I hired
Spike as my ghostwriter.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.252
Aaah! Spike's a ghost!

05:54.686 --> 05:59.903
Anyway, Spike here writes down
everything I say. Don't you, Spike?

05:59.904 --> 06:03.507
"Don't you, Spike?"
Got it!

06:03.787 --> 06:06.966
This way I can stay focused on
performing those acts of bravery...

06:06.967 --> 06:09.547
...that nopony else
has the guts to perform.

06:09.548 --> 06:11.485
Yeah, it takes guts.

06:11.486 --> 06:13.287
But it also takes brains.

06:13.288 --> 06:15.534
And sometimes a big lunch and a nap.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.690
Being a hero is surely
not for everypony...

06:18.691 --> 06:21.042
...but I'm up to the challenge.

06:27.768 --> 06:29.435
'ere you go.

06:29.656 --> 06:32.834
Someday I wanna be just like you.

06:32.835 --> 06:35.940
Aim high, kid, but don't
aim for the impossible.

06:38.967 --> 06:41.586
Help! Heeelp!

06:41.587 --> 06:44.275
Uh... Don't you think
you should go and help?

06:44.276 --> 06:48.462
Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds
to spare. Just a couple more.

06:54.973 --> 06:56.985
"The tension is unbearable."

06:56.986 --> 06:59.490
"Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?"

07:18.129 --> 07:21.123
Holy turnips! That pony
came out of nowhere!

07:21.360 --> 07:24.176
I've never seen such
bravery in all my life!

07:24.177 --> 07:27.817
That's right. Ponyville has a new hero.

07:27.818 --> 07:32.518
A mysterious mare, that has
done well by our fair city today.

07:32.519 --> 07:37.745
I dub this new masked hero
the Mysterious Mare Do Well!

07:40.343 --> 07:42.053
Mare Do Well, huh?

07:42.054 --> 07:45.823
Well, that mare would do well
to stay out of my way.

07:45.824 --> 07:50.822
Ponyville's only got room for
one hero and that hero is me!

08:08.118 --> 08:10.867
Never fear! Your friendly
neighborhood Rainbow...

08:10.868 --> 08:13.902
Excuse me! Do you think
you could skip your catchphrase...

08:13.903 --> 08:16.108
...and just hurry up and save us?

08:16.109 --> 08:17.520
Ugh... Fine.

08:17.833 --> 08:19.081
Picky, picky.

08:41.735 --> 08:44.426
Oh, thank you, Mare Do... Well...

08:46.316 --> 08:48.117
I can't believe it!

08:48.346 --> 08:50.925
Mare Do Well is stronger than me?

08:50.926 --> 08:54.475
Well, a hero is more than just muscle.

08:54.476 --> 08:57.499
And she's gonna learn that the hard way.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.074
Never fear, your friendly neighbor...

09:31.577 --> 09:32.971
Never fear...

09:34.878 --> 09:35.885
I'm coming!

09:36.450 --> 09:37.584
Hold on!

09:38.018 --> 09:39.208
Look!

10:04.597 --> 10:05.973
Look out for the...!

10:05.974 --> 10:07.775
Watch out for falling...!

10:07.976 --> 10:10.690
Watch your left! Left!
Your other left!

10:11.659 --> 10:15.115
Here you go. Safe and sound.

10:21.266 --> 10:25.199
Well, Mare Do Well, or should I
call you Mare Do Slow?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.881
You're gonna have to pick up the pace,
if you wanna compete with me...

10:27.882 --> 10:29.760
...cause I move like lightning.

10:29.761 --> 10:33.991
Actually, she saved all of us.
We owe her our lives.

10:42.776 --> 10:48.042
Okay. She's strong, fast and somehow
knows what's gonna happen ahead of time.

10:48.302 --> 10:50.855
I gotta step up my game.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.972
If the dam breaks, the whole
town will be flooded!

11:05.198 --> 11:07.933
Looks like Ponyville needs a hero!

11:10.279 --> 11:13.720
Easy-peasy. My game
is officially back on.

11:13.721 --> 11:16.355
If only somepony were here
to pat me on the back.

11:16.356 --> 11:18.307
Huh. Guess I'll have to do it myself.

11:24.377 --> 11:26.539
Heeelp!

11:29.327 --> 11:30.840
Heeelp!

11:38.492 --> 11:39.550
You?!

11:40.553 --> 11:43.338
Huh. I *suppose* you
want me to thank...

11:52.990 --> 11:55.229
You gotta be kidding me.

12:06.911 --> 12:08.449
Let me get this straight.

12:08.450 --> 12:10.506
She's strong, she's agile...

12:10.507 --> 12:12.138
...and she's magic?!

12:14.839 --> 12:17.417
How do I compete with THAT?!

12:19.302 --> 12:20.487
Wait a minute.

12:20.488 --> 12:22.321
I do have a leg up on her.

12:22.322 --> 12:23.443
And that leg is...

12:23.998 --> 12:25.371
Wings!

12:27.296 --> 12:29.929
Ha! Take that, Mare Do Well!

12:39.133 --> 12:40.983
Oh, for the love of Pete...

12:43.148 --> 12:44.460
Gotta hand it to the girl.

12:44.461 --> 12:47.897
That Mare Do Well sure can pull out
some pretty pretty heroic feats.

12:48.451 --> 12:52.516
I must say I was impressed by that
spell she used to fix the dam.

12:52.517 --> 12:55.587
Seems like something like that
would take quite a bit of study.

12:57.345 --> 13:00.486
She really cares about
everypony's safety.

13:00.487 --> 13:03.890
Have you seen her costume?
It is to die for!

13:03.891 --> 13:06.408
If you ask me, she's a hero of fashion.

13:06.409 --> 13:08.593
And she's modest and humble.

13:08.594 --> 13:11.226
She lets her actions
speak for themselves.

13:11.227 --> 13:12.471
Gotta admire that.

13:12.472 --> 13:14.505
I don't have to admire that!

13:14.506 --> 13:16.574
I don't think she's all that great.

13:16.575 --> 13:17.812
"She's great."

13:17.813 --> 13:19.328
I didn't say that.

13:19.329 --> 13:21.794
Sounds like somepony's jealous.

13:21.795 --> 13:23.096
Who? Me?

13:23.097 --> 13:24.546
"Rainbow Dash is jealous."

13:24.547 --> 13:26.512
Don't write that, Spike!

13:30.662 --> 13:33.723
"Correction: Rainbow Dash
is very jealous."

13:33.724 --> 13:35.814
Fine! Laugh all you want!

13:35.815 --> 13:40.047
But I'll be the one laughing when I prove
to you all that I'm just as good...

13:40.048 --> 13:43.756
...no, that I'm a better
hero than Mare Do Well!

13:51.518 --> 13:54.067
No sign of trouble here, darn it.

13:55.193 --> 13:58.482
Buses and baby carriages are always
careening down this hill.

13:58.483 --> 14:01.983
Where is an out-of-control vehicle
when you need one?!

14:02.459 --> 14:06.471
There are absolutely no freak natural
disasters going on anywhere!

14:06.472 --> 14:10.896
How am I supposed to prove myself
when everything's so normal and safe?

14:12.135 --> 14:14.106
Hold it right there, Granny Smith!

14:14.107 --> 14:15.604
You don't have to pretend with me.

14:15.605 --> 14:18.298
I can see you're way
over your head here.

14:18.299 --> 14:20.543
Yes, what's that?

14:20.544 --> 14:23.207
You're putting on
a brave face! I get it.

14:23.208 --> 14:25.108
But you don't have to anymore.

14:25.109 --> 14:27.364
I'll help you cross the street.

14:28.754 --> 14:31.938
Actually, I can cross
the street just fine.

14:31.939 --> 14:38.192
Don't worry! You're
in extremely capable hooves!

14:40.458 --> 14:44.531
Stop! Back off! Back off!

14:46.667 --> 14:49.412
Here we are! Safe and sound.

14:49.811 --> 14:53.079
A good and heroic citizen
deserves a little recognition.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.433
Don't you think?

14:56.822 --> 15:00.476
I didn't want to cross
the street in the first place!

15:05.571 --> 15:07.267
Somepony's in trouble!

15:10.271 --> 15:12.586
You'd better let me handle this, ma'am.

15:12.587 --> 15:16.404
For your own safety I must
ask you to stand back.

15:16.405 --> 15:17.912
Oh, brother.

15:38.588 --> 15:40.127
Ta-da!

15:42.267 --> 15:43.941
Uh, thanks.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.868
How would you describe what I just did?

15:45.869 --> 15:47.900
Would you say I was... amazing?

15:47.901 --> 15:49.746
Aren't you milking this a bit?

15:49.747 --> 15:51.427
Please, just answer the question.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.545
Was I or was I not amazing?

15:53.546 --> 15:56.026
Oh, you're amazing,
all right. An amazingly...

15:56.027 --> 15:57.366
Oh, look!

16:05.093 --> 16:07.583
Another great feat of heroism.

16:07.584 --> 16:10.083
I have just saved that grass!

16:10.084 --> 16:11.260
From what?

16:11.990 --> 16:13.274
From weeds!

16:13.275 --> 16:16.250
Weeds that were attempting
to eat this lawn.

16:17.736 --> 16:19.290
Lame.

16:23.188 --> 16:25.652
Oh, who am I kidding?

16:32.884 --> 16:37.517
All anypony talks about is
Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.007
What about me?

16:39.008 --> 16:42.548
How could everypony forget
about me so easily?

16:42.944 --> 16:45.218
I mean, have I changed?

16:45.219 --> 16:47.110
Same sleek body...

16:47.139 --> 16:48.769
Same flowing mane...

16:48.770 --> 16:50.814
Same spectacular hooves...

16:50.815 --> 16:53.302
Nope! I'm still awesome.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.074
They're wrong.

16:55.756 --> 16:58.732
But... then why am I all alone?

16:59.413 --> 17:01.716
I hate being all alone.

17:02.904 --> 17:05.779
-Hey, Rainbow Dash!
-I knew it!

17:06.929 --> 17:10.925
No need to apologize, squirt.
Anypony could make a mistake.

17:11.325 --> 17:13.554
Mistake? What mistake?

17:14.701 --> 17:17.113
Wait a minute. Why are you here?

17:17.114 --> 17:18.682
To invite you to join us.

17:18.683 --> 17:22.261
We're heading off to the thank you
parade for Ponyville's greatest hero:

17:22.262 --> 17:23.683
Mare Do Well.

17:24.049 --> 17:29.515
No! No way! Can't you see I...
I wanna be alone? I love being alone!

17:30.168 --> 17:32.193
Oh. Okay. See you later, then.

17:32.380 --> 17:35.170
Yeah, right. Like I'm gonna thank *her*.

17:35.548 --> 17:38.730
Thank you, Mare Do Well,
whoever you are, for ruining e...

17:39.777 --> 17:42.163
Hey, squirt! Wait up!

17:44.566 --> 17:48.205
Welcome to Ponyville's first,
but surely not last...

17:48.206 --> 17:53.508
...thank you parade in honor of our
city's greatest hero, the Mysterious...

17:53.509 --> 17:55.360
...Mare Do Well!

18:01.687 --> 18:04.454
The Mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?

18:05.913 --> 18:07.515
So what are you hiding?

18:07.516 --> 18:10.806
Let's see how mysterious
you are without that mask.

18:34.820 --> 18:35.993
What a hay?

18:56.812 --> 18:58.563
I got you now!

19:01.782 --> 19:03.919
All right, Miss Mysterious.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.194
Mystery...

19:06.598 --> 19:07.816
...solved!

19:08.777 --> 19:10.715
P-P-P-P-Pinkie?!

19:20.368 --> 19:21.933
Twilight?!

19:24.509 --> 19:25.706
Applejack?!

19:26.055 --> 19:27.946
There were three of you?

19:27.947 --> 19:31.172
Yep. We all played
Mare Do Well at different times.

19:31.173 --> 19:33.749
I stopped the carriage bus
with these babies.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.587
Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee.

19:36.588 --> 19:40.004
I saved the construction
workers with my Pinkie sense.

19:43.369 --> 19:45.788
-Sorry.
-It's alright.

19:45.789 --> 19:48.475
And I used my magic to fix the dam.

19:48.476 --> 19:51.772
Ooh! Ooh! And I did
the flyby afterwards.

19:51.773 --> 19:55.644
I made the costumes.
Fabulous if I do say so myself.

19:56.872 --> 19:59.056
I don't understand.

19:59.370 --> 20:00.401
Why?!

20:00.402 --> 20:02.528
Don't you want me to be a hero?

20:02.529 --> 20:05.142
Of course we want you to be a hero.

20:05.143 --> 20:07.775
But a real hero doesn't brag.

20:07.776 --> 20:10.945
Uh, I guess I did start
to brag a little.

20:10.946 --> 20:12.929
A LITTLE?!

20:14.232 --> 20:16.109
Okay, a lot.

20:16.110 --> 20:19.377
Celebrating your accomplishments
is natural, but...

20:19.378 --> 20:22.480
Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.

20:22.481 --> 20:26.828
Yeah! The only thing that should be rubbed
in anypony's face is chocolate cake.

20:31.956 --> 20:34.153
I think we're gettin' off topic here.

20:34.154 --> 20:38.206
What we're trying to say is it's great
to be really good at something...

20:38.207 --> 20:41.241
...but it's important to act
with grace and humility.

20:43.269 --> 20:47.140
Oh! That makes loads more sense!

20:47.534 --> 20:49.673
Yeah. You're right.

20:49.674 --> 20:54.260
And I guess I should also act with grace
and humility when others outshine me.

20:54.797 --> 20:56.958
Like... Mare Do Well.

20:56.959 --> 21:00.285
Sounds like you've got a letter
to write to Princess Celestia.

21:00.286 --> 21:01.804
Already got it covered.

21:01.805 --> 21:04.843
As your ghostwriter, I've already
penned a letter to the princess.

21:04.844 --> 21:09.291
That's nice of you, Spike, but I really
wanna write this letter myself.

21:09.292 --> 21:13.115
Aw, come on! I wrote the whole thing already!

21:13.116 --> 21:15.143
Okay. Let's hear it.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.370
-"Dear Princess Cel..."
-Look out!

21:18.371 --> 21:20.541
It's a real ghost!

21:32.932 --> 21:36.432
