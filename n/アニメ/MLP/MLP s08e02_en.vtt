WEBVTT

00:03.971 --> 00:05.571
Twilight: This happened
while we were gone?

00:05.673 --> 00:08.240
Applejack: Friendship quests
beyond Equestria?

00:08.342 --> 00:10.075
Twilight: We're
gonna open a school!

00:10.277 --> 00:13.779
Neighsay: We expect you to
do things by the book.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.048
Twilight: We have a huge
responsibility,

00:16.150 --> 00:18.584
and I need you all to
do this by the book.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.721
These ponies are the
heroes of Equestria?

00:21.923 --> 00:24.423
Gallus: This is just a quick
mental health break!

00:24.525 --> 00:26.525
Neighsay: The school
is under attack!

00:26.727 --> 00:28.427
Those are students!?

00:28.629 --> 00:32.531
I am shutting
this school DOWN.

00:32.633 --> 00:33.565
Oh!

01:15.176 --> 01:16.141
Twilight?

01:16.243 --> 01:17.576
You feeling OK?

01:28.456 --> 01:29.689
Look on the bright side!

01:30.191 --> 01:33.092
Sure the EEA closed
your Friendship School,

01:33.394 --> 01:35.194
but now you've got
time to do other stuff!

01:35.296 --> 01:36.728
It's like being on vacation!

01:37.030 --> 01:37.496
Whoa!

01:37.598 --> 01:39.398
A failure vacation!

01:39.600 --> 01:41.734
I'm supposed to be the
Princess of Friendship.

01:41.836 --> 01:44.503
And all I did was make enemies
with Equestria's allies,

01:44.605 --> 01:46.772
upset my friends,
and get my school...

01:47.708 --> 01:49.108
unaccredited!

01:49.210 --> 01:51.576
THERE IS NO BRIGHT SIDE!

01:55.916 --> 01:58.284
OK then. I'm gonna
need backup.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.485
Operation Cheer Up is a go!

02:03.457 --> 02:04.990
Come on, Twilight!

02:05.092 --> 02:07.826
You can't sit around in
the boring dark all day!

02:08.028 --> 02:09.228
Exactly!

02:09.430 --> 02:12.497
What you need is a double dose
of Granny Smith's apple mash.

02:16.137 --> 02:18.704
Whenever I'm sad, a
hug from Angel Bunny

02:18.806 --> 02:20.606
always makes me
feel better.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.216
Oh!

02:30.918 --> 02:32.885
Uh. Maybe it's just me.

02:33.287 --> 02:37.222
I find that nothing brightens
my mood like a new ensemble!

02:39.460 --> 02:41.126
[sigh] Thanks, Rarity.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.295
It's a great dress...

02:42.697 --> 02:46.165
[sobbing] for somepony who
knows how to run a school.

02:49.036 --> 02:51.603
You didn't tell me
this was a pity party!

02:51.705 --> 02:53.339
I would've brought ice cream!

02:53.641 --> 02:55.775
I appreciate you trying
to make me feel better.

02:55.977 --> 02:58.743
But not everything can
be fixed with dresses and cupcakes.

02:59.079 --> 02:59.912
WHAT!

03:01.082 --> 03:03.315
I just need some time
to be alone and think.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.124
Oh!

03:12.994 --> 03:14.426
I wondered how
long you'd take

03:14.528 --> 03:16.629
to get tired of
pillow fort pouting.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.331
Everypony's already
tried to cheer me up.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.532
It won't work.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.235
I'm not gonna
cheer you up.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.204
I'm gonna tell you
what you did wrong.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.438
What!?

03:26.940 --> 03:28.707
You gave up too easily.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.177
Hey, you made me a
guidance counselor.

03:32.279 --> 03:33.579
That means tough love.

03:33.781 --> 03:34.780
Neighsay was right.

03:34.882 --> 03:35.847
I failed.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.717
The school WAS a disaster.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.185
So was I when
you met me!

03:40.287 --> 03:42.621
But you showed me that
when you know in your heart

03:42.723 --> 03:45.057
something is right,
you stand up for it.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.592
You did that for me.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.160
Why not for this?

03:50.631 --> 03:52.564
I can't go against the EEA!

03:52.666 --> 03:54.867
They're in charge of all of
the schools in Equestria.

03:54.969 --> 03:57.936
And you're in charge of all
the Friendship in Equestria.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.738
Why should you
let somepony else

03:59.840 --> 04:01.473
stop you from
doing your job?

04:01.775 --> 04:02.941
But the EEA rule book--

04:03.143 --> 04:04.508
[splash]
Doesn't matter.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.713
You can write
your own rules!

04:07.915 --> 04:09.881
Because you're doing
something new.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.583
Something important.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.819
You're right!

04:13.921 --> 04:15.654
WHY we're doing this
is way more important

04:15.756 --> 04:17.256
than HOW we're
doing this.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.024
And we ARE
doing this!

04:19.526 --> 04:21.660
Now that's the
Twilight I know.

04:21.862 --> 04:22.694
How can I help?

04:22.996 --> 04:24.129
You already have.

04:26.867 --> 04:27.867
[door opens] Guess what?

04:28.169 --> 04:31.036
The School of Friendship
is back in business!

04:31.938 --> 04:32.671
WHAT?

04:32.773 --> 04:33.439
But why?

04:33.541 --> 04:34.373
Oh no!

04:34.475 --> 04:35.440
Bad idea.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.743
Do we still get
to guess?

04:38.345 --> 04:41.013
No offense, Twilight, but
teaching at that school

04:41.115 --> 04:43.015
was the most boring,
horrible, awful thing ever.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.118
Uh. Pretty sure she's gonna
take offense to that.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.253
No, Rainbow Dash
is right.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.255
I owe you all an apology.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.292
I was so focused on
doing things the EEA way,

04:53.494 --> 04:54.860
I didn't listen to
any of you.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.663
I'm sorry. I
promise this time,

04:57.865 --> 04:59.765
we'll run the school
like friends should.

04:59.967 --> 05:00.832
Together.

05:01.903 --> 05:05.304
So we'd be allowed to
teach however we want to?

05:05.406 --> 05:07.072
No more scary
pop quizzes?

05:07.174 --> 05:09.408
Confetti cannons
for every creature?

05:14.381 --> 05:16.882
Whatever you need to teach
the elements of harmony.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.750
Yippppeeeeee!

05:21.822 --> 05:25.157
Well, in that case, we're
behind you 100%, Twilight!

05:25.359 --> 05:28.427
Spike: Ahem, just
two small problems.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.195
The school is still
unaccredited...

05:31.332 --> 05:33.332
And we don't have
any students.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.534
I'll take care of
the first part,

05:35.636 --> 05:37.636
if you five can
round up our class.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.704
Totally!

05:39.206 --> 05:41.073
Uh... how?

05:41.475 --> 05:44.176
Roundin' up the pony students
ain't gonna be an issue but...

05:44.278 --> 05:45.877
The creatures from
the other kingdoms

05:45.979 --> 05:48.247
seemed pretty
upset with us.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.015
Pfft. Nonsense!

05:50.117 --> 05:53.318
I'm certain we can win them
over with our charm and style!

05:57.191 --> 06:00.626
Cupcake gram for
Prince Rutherford!

06:00.828 --> 06:02.561
Why Pink Pony here?

06:02.663 --> 06:04.363
Yaks mad at ponies.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.666
Beeee-cause you don't
have to be mad anymore!

06:07.768 --> 06:10.269
We're reopening Twilight
Sparkle's School of Friendship

06:10.371 --> 06:12.104
and it's gonna be super-
ooper-dooper

06:12.206 --> 06:13.505
better than before!

06:13.607 --> 06:16.441
We're ever so sorry about
the misunderstanding.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.777
All creatures are
of course welcome!

06:18.879 --> 06:21.079
We would be really happy
if you sent your student

06:21.181 --> 06:22.514
back to class.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.049
It won't be the
same without 'em!

06:24.151 --> 06:26.218
We're open and ready
to start teaching...

06:26.320 --> 06:27.519
...right now!

06:27.721 --> 06:30.389
So? What are you
waiting for?

06:30.491 --> 06:32.023
Get your student
and let's go!

06:32.425 --> 06:33.993
Not happening.

06:34.295 --> 06:36.895
Aw, do you need me to
do the whole apology

06:36.997 --> 06:39.531
and explanation thing again?

06:39.633 --> 06:40.899
OK.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.302
Listen, missy.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.537
It's not happening
because--

06:45.639 --> 06:47.939
YOUR STUDENT IS GONE!

06:48.541 --> 06:49.541
WHAT!

06:54.848 --> 06:56.215
Prince Rutherford: WHERE YONA!

06:56.717 --> 06:58.617
This all Ponies' fault!

06:59.219 --> 07:00.952
You're pretty quick
to blame them.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.521
What are you
hiding, Yak?

07:03.324 --> 07:06.892
Uh, can we just focus on
finding our lost students?

07:07.294 --> 07:08.794
Nice try!

07:08.896 --> 07:12.431
You grubs are probably
hiding the whole lot of 'em!

07:12.633 --> 07:15.934
Please, everycreature, if
you can just explain

07:16.036 --> 07:17.069
what happened...

07:17.771 --> 07:20.872
The students left us notes
before they disappeared.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.542
When the school closed, they
didn't want to say goodbye

07:23.644 --> 07:24.643
to each other.

07:24.745 --> 07:28.113
They claim they ran
away to stay together.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.015
I can't believe it!

07:30.217 --> 07:31.950
They did learn friendship!

07:34.220 --> 07:34.987
Sorry.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.956
The students couldn't have
done this by themselves.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.326
SOME creature is hiding them!

07:41.528 --> 07:43.695
If the niece of our
queen is not found soon,

07:43.797 --> 07:46.632
I promise there
will be retribution!

07:47.134 --> 07:49.701
Yeah? Well, my dragons
will burn every kingdom

07:49.803 --> 07:52.571
until we find which of
you is hiding Smolder.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.973
Tell it to the Griffon Army.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.809
Yaks fight griffons
and dragons!

07:57.911 --> 07:59.711
The Changeling
Empire can't afford

07:59.813 --> 08:01.380
an international incident.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.949
If any creature blames the
Changelings for this--

08:04.051 --> 08:06.018
What are you up
to, shape-shifter?

08:06.520 --> 08:07.853
But we're friends...

08:08.355 --> 08:10.155
Find the students
quickly, Twilight.

08:10.357 --> 08:13.024
Or I fear our world
will be at war.

08:15.396 --> 08:17.496
Twilight: OK. Let's
review what we know.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.165
Smolder, Ocellus,
Silverstream, Yona,

08:20.267 --> 08:22.300
and Gallus
disappeared together.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.071
That's all we know.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.540
They're probably just
off hidin' somewhere.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.843
Unless they used some kind
of spell to disappear.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.980
Ooh! Or went undercover!

08:35.382 --> 08:38.717
Maybe they were attacked
by a ferocious shrimp!

08:38.819 --> 08:40.852
Nopony EVER expects that.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.854
[gasp] Shrimps can attack?

08:43.156 --> 08:46.024
Nope. That's why
nopony expects it!

08:50.030 --> 08:50.796
Whoa!

08:55.702 --> 08:56.635
Hi, Sandbar!

08:57.637 --> 08:58.637
Are you having a party?

08:58.839 --> 09:03.942
No! I'm just, uh...
really hungry.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.947
We need to think
like our students.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.116
If someone told us we would
never see each other again,

09:11.418 --> 09:13.118
what would we do?

09:13.620 --> 09:14.886
Go someplace we
could all hang out

09:14.988 --> 09:16.855
and eat lots and
lots of cupcakes!

09:19.760 --> 09:21.126
What..?

09:21.328 --> 09:24.596
Sandbar was friends with
all of the missing students.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.299
And he just got
plenty of cupcakes.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.901
Huh... He was at the
farm this morning,

09:30.003 --> 09:32.171
picking up a
wagonload of apples.

09:32.273 --> 09:35.006
And I saw him in a shop
buying pillows and blankets!

09:35.308 --> 09:37.909
[gasp] He must be
taking all that stuff

09:38.011 --> 09:39.044
to the other students!

09:39.146 --> 09:40.512
We gotta follow him!

09:50.324 --> 09:53.959
Heh. This place is way cooler
than I thought it'd be.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.033
Even<i> I'm</i> impressed.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.668
What's it called
again, Ocellus?

10:03.770 --> 10:05.504
The Castle of the
Two Sisters.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.123
I remembered it from class:

10:07.224 --> 10:09.941
Princess Twilight's History of
Pre-Equestrian Friendships.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.677
Huh. Who knew?

10:12.179 --> 10:14.146
School was actually
good for something!

10:14.548 --> 10:16.748
Yona not really like school.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.151
But Yona like new friends.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.254
Smolder...Like...Breathing.

10:22.656 --> 10:23.588
Silverstream: Hey, you
guys!

10:23.690 --> 10:24.789
Sandbar is back!

10:30.997 --> 10:33.498
Cupcakes are best cakes!

10:34.401 --> 10:35.166
Agh!

10:39.773 --> 10:42.274
Huh. Thanks for the
assist, Gallus.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.976
Pff. I was saving the cupcakes.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.649
Pillows, how nice!

10:50.851 --> 10:53.485
The castle is going to
be so much more comfy.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.020
And fun!

10:55.222 --> 10:56.621
Pillow fight!

11:04.631 --> 11:05.965
Silverstream: YOU GUYS!

11:06.667 --> 11:08.099
I just found...

11:08.401 --> 11:09.767
STAIRS!

11:11.338 --> 11:13.405
And ... we care because...

11:13.807 --> 11:15.674
Stairs are awesome!

11:16.076 --> 11:17.309
We don't have anything
like 'em underwater.

11:17.411 --> 11:18.177
Cause you know...

11:18.879 --> 11:20.111
No way to climb 'em.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.547
Ohhhh.

11:23.549 --> 11:25.751
This place has everything!

11:26.153 --> 11:28.787
If only my family back
home could see it!

11:32.759 --> 11:35.093
I wish the other Changelings
could meet you all.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.395
You're not nearly as
strange as the stories say.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.230
Gee, thanks.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.199
But yeah, hanging out
with other creatures

11:41.301 --> 11:43.735
is actually...not bad.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.777
Uh, MOST other creatures.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.579
What is THAT thing?

11:54.781 --> 11:57.682
[sigh] Am I the ONLY one who
didn't sleep through

11:57.784 --> 12:00.952
Professor Fluttershy's Critters
of Comfort and Conflict Class?

12:01.154 --> 12:02.454
It's a puckwudgie!

12:02.756 --> 12:04.455
Maybe I can make
friends with it!

12:15.535 --> 12:16.401
Oops.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.069
Yak plan better.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.437
YAAAA!

12:46.599 --> 12:47.666
Think, Ocellus!

12:47.868 --> 12:49.734
Did Professor Fluttershy
say anything about

12:49.836 --> 12:52.437
how to beat Puckwudgies
in her lecture?

12:52.539 --> 12:55.173
Ah! I'm sorry, I can't remember.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.142
I'm gonna go ahead and
guess it's not pillows,

12:57.244 --> 12:59.744
apples...... or cupcakes.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.481
Wouldn't class have been about
how to make friends with them?

13:02.683 --> 13:05.784
Uh, guys? They're
getting really close...

13:06.386 --> 13:07.819
Yona not scared.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.554
Yona have friends.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.835
Is that Professor Egghead?

13:30.109 --> 13:31.109
Aw, yeah!

13:41.721 --> 13:43.789
Oh! Don't hurt them!

13:44.691 --> 13:47.492
Just ask them to leave nicely.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.805
Not bad!

14:01.307 --> 14:02.273
For pony...

14:02.475 --> 14:04.843
Wow. They're amazing.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.379
I had no idea our teachers
were actually cool.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.715
I've been trying to tell you!

14:10.917 --> 14:12.651
Did you see that!?

14:12.853 --> 14:14.285
Rainbow Dash was like zooooom!

14:14.387 --> 14:15.453
And then whoooaa!

14:15.555 --> 14:17.188
The Puckwudgies went flying!

14:17.290 --> 14:18.990
And then the birds came and...

14:19.092 --> 14:20.725
Yeah. We all
just lived it.

14:20.827 --> 14:21.627
But you're right.

14:21.729 --> 14:25.630
That was pretty amazing...
even by dragon standards.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.434
Is everycreature all right?

14:32.906 --> 14:34.673
You're lucky we
got here in time.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.075
You know, this probably
isn't the safest place

14:37.177 --> 14:38.377
for a campout.

14:38.679 --> 14:41.846
Does that mean you're going
to send us back to our homes?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.583
Not exactly.

14:44.685 --> 14:46.384
We have another
option in mind.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.588
We're listening.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.790
It's pretty clear you've
already started learning

14:51.892 --> 14:53.658
friendship without
your teachers.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.194
But we'd like to show
you even more...

14:56.496 --> 14:58.095
if you come back to school?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.467
Not much of a choice.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.637
To be honest, we felt
exactly the same way

15:05.739 --> 15:08.273
when Twilight told us she
was reopening the school.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.376
But this time, we guarantee
it shall be different.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.212
Oh, yeah. With
class run my way,

15:14.314 --> 15:17.215
it'll be TWO HUNDRED and
twenty percent cooler.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.052
And without the EEA,
it'll be much friendlier.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.321
Plus all your nations
won't go to war

15:23.423 --> 15:24.522
if you come back with us!

15:24.724 --> 15:25.623
Bonus!

15:27.127 --> 15:28.893
Wait, what's happening?

15:36.336 --> 15:37.168
Celestia: Twilight!

15:37.270 --> 15:39.538
I was so relieved
to get your letter.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.940
As was Queen Novo.

15:42.142 --> 15:45.009
Oh, we're just glad you're
all right, Silverstream.

15:45.211 --> 15:48.713
Don't expect a welcome
party from me, sonny.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.715
It's time you got home.

15:52.519 --> 15:53.384
I'm not leaving.

15:53.586 --> 15:54.753
WHAT!?

15:55.155 --> 15:56.054
None of us are.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.189
Sorry, Thorax.

15:59.191 --> 16:00.625
Yak not understand.

16:00.727 --> 16:01.960
This pony joke?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.262
No. We're going
back to school.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.564
How? You can't
even get inside.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.671
School is back in session.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.049
Who dared remove my seal?

16:25.251 --> 16:26.985
I did, Chancellor Neighsay.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.387
And I respectfully
ask you to step aside,

16:29.589 --> 16:31.356
or classes will start late.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.192
Classes won't start at all!

16:34.294 --> 16:36.227
The EEA has spoken.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.829
And NONE SHALL PASS!

16:40.100 --> 16:42.901
Yak pass if Yak say! HMPH!

16:43.503 --> 16:47.005
This is for the greater good.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.140
The school was disorganized!

16:49.242 --> 16:51.042
The teachers unqualified!

16:51.244 --> 16:55.179
And those dangerous and
unpredictable "students"

16:55.481 --> 16:58.015
put ponies' lives in danger!

17:01.288 --> 17:03.922
Grr! I'll show you unpredictable.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.760
Hold on, please!

17:09.062 --> 17:12.463
I'm sure Princess Twilight
Sparkle has a good explanation

17:12.565 --> 17:14.165
for all of this.

17:14.767 --> 17:15.466
I do.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.168
It's true that my
School of Friendship

17:17.270 --> 17:18.937
is EEA unaccredited.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.372
Look! She said it without
doing the eye thing!

17:21.874 --> 17:24.843
Then it is not a school!

17:25.045 --> 17:27.111
It's not an EEA school.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.747
It's a friendship school.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.849
With its own rules.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.383
I should know.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.152
I wrote the book.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.257
These students reminded me
that every friendship

17:39.359 --> 17:40.258
is special.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.261
So the way we teach it
has to be just as unique.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.864
My school is going to
do things differently.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.699
Allowing all of
these creatures

17:48.801 --> 17:50.635
to attend your school...

17:50.737 --> 17:54.605
changing the rules for them!
It simply won't work!

17:54.707 --> 17:57.308
I seem to recall something
about Earth Ponies,

17:57.410 --> 18:01.913
Unicorns and Pegasi doing
something similar, don't you?

18:02.515 --> 18:04.048
I promise you, Chancellor,

18:04.150 --> 18:06.751
my school will help
protect Equestria.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.787
Or destroy it.

18:13.194 --> 18:17.662
Hmph. How's this school gonna be
any different from last time?

Ember: Aw, fine!

20:30.396 --> 20:33.431
If you promise to stop
singing, Smolder can stay!

20:33.833 --> 20:35.099
Wahoo!

20:35.601 --> 20:39.104
Ah.. If dragon stay, yak stay.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.974
I know you will make the
Changelings proud, Ocellus.

20:43.176 --> 20:44.776
You belong here.

20:45.678 --> 20:49.680
Now can you show me those
stair-things you mentioned?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.915
Aw, yeah! [giggle]

20:54.520 --> 20:55.219
What?

20:55.321 --> 20:56.654
You belong at home.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.224
You think I care if
you've made friends?

20:59.826 --> 21:01.659
Please, Grandpa
Gruff?

21:04.697 --> 21:07.898
Wha- All right! Stop doing that!

21:12.338 --> 21:14.772
Guess I make a pretty good
Guidance Counselor, huh?

21:14.874 --> 21:18.376
Yes! Writing a rule book
was the most fun ever!

21:18.478 --> 21:21.312
I can't wait to start working
on the new lesson plans!

21:21.414 --> 21:22.481
Ahem.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.616
With some help
from my friends.
