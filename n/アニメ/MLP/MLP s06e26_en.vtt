<i> It's the ponies</i>
<i> from my old village.</i>

00:09.885 --> 00:12.130
Oh! It's only a dream.

00:12.300 --> 00:15.780
With my past, I should never
be in charge of anything.

00:15.955 --> 00:19.145
THEY'VE TAKEN MY SISTER AND I!
IT'S WORSE THAN LAST TIME!

00:19.305 --> 00:21.335
Chrysalis and the
Changelings are back.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.740
They've ponynapped all of
the most powerful ponies

00:23.770 --> 00:24.780
in Equestria.

00:25.105 --> 00:28.100
This is Thorax. He's
a reformed Changeling.

00:28.385 --> 00:29.900
They took Fluttershy?

00:30.890 --> 00:34.510
I think I have a pretty good
idea where she might be.

01:20.905 --> 01:23.720
Oh, this is so strange.
We're here and that's there

01:23.815 --> 01:27.200
and I clearly meant for us
to be there and not here.

01:27.410 --> 01:29.565
Oh, I can probably
explain that.

01:29.605 --> 01:31.915
Oh well, if at first
you don't succeed.

01:32.515 --> 01:35.200
Maybe we should come
up with a plan first?

01:35.975 --> 01:36.655
A what?

01:36.955 --> 01:39.390
You know, figuring out the
best way to do something

01:39.460 --> 01:41.845
before you actually do it?

01:42.030 --> 01:44.600
Oh, that's adorable.

01:44.625 --> 01:47.635
But, you see, unlike
you I can do anything.

01:47.745 --> 01:48.625
Actually...

01:48.650 --> 01:51.385
That's all very nice, but
really a waste of time.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.835
We have me.

01:52.915 --> 01:55.265
And what else could
we possibly need?

01:55.495 --> 01:59.640
A draconequis with magic AND
half a brain might help.

01:59.740 --> 02:01.445
Why are you here
again?

02:01.520 --> 02:04.605
I mean, it's not like you're
going to stop the Changelings

02:04.645 --> 02:06.590
by pulling a rabbit
out of the hat.

02:06.730 --> 02:09.365
At least my magic
can do something.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.245
The thing about
magic here is...

02:11.280 --> 02:11.950
Like this!

02:12.690 --> 02:15.175
For Fluttershy!

02:15.765 --> 02:17.100
Eeyah!

02:21.760 --> 02:23.960
I've been trying to tell you.

02:24.150 --> 02:26.850
Nothing other than
Changeling magic works here!

02:27.120 --> 02:30.395
Chrysalis' throne is carved
from an ancient dark stone

02:30.425 --> 02:33.200
that soaks up outside magic
the same way Changelings

02:33.260 --> 02:36.295
soak up love. It's how
she keeps the hive safe.

02:41.840 --> 02:45.325
So... What kind of
plan were you thinking?

02:46.135 --> 02:50.710
Without magic I have no idea.
But nopony else is coming,

02:50.785 --> 02:52.970
so somepony better
come up with something.

02:54.880 --> 02:55.550
Anypony?

02:57.305 --> 02:58.235
<i> Anything?</i>

02:59.350 --> 03:00.035
Hmmm.

03:00.635 --> 03:03.770
This throne. If we get into
the hive and destroy it,

03:03.890 --> 03:05.170
can we get our magic back?

03:05.505 --> 03:06.020
Uh-huh.

03:06.460 --> 03:08.785
Well, that's a terrible plan.

03:09.020 --> 03:11.540
How are we even supposed
to get to the hive?

03:11.885 --> 03:13.460
We walk?

03:14.690 --> 03:18.010
I haven't walked that
far in millennia.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.550
Ugh.

03:23.330 --> 03:26.580
Ugh. I don't know how any
of you manage not being able

03:26.625 --> 03:29.990
to disappear and reappear
whenever you want.

03:30.135 --> 03:34.630
Well, I for one definitely miss
you being able to disappear.

03:34.685 --> 03:36.695
Give Discord a break.

03:36.875 --> 03:39.495
None of us knew we weren't
going to be able to use magic.

03:39.695 --> 03:40.640
I did.

03:41.085 --> 03:43.650
If we get separated, it might
make sense to have a way

03:43.690 --> 03:45.745
to make sure we are
who we say we are.

03:46.200 --> 03:51.125
Ooo. Like a secret code.
How about if I say "We are"

03:51.285 --> 03:56.405
you say "Doomed?" Or you say
"Rescue" and I say "I'm--

03:58.200 --> 04:01.540
How about if we say "Klutzy"
and you say "Draconequis?"

04:01.740 --> 04:04.490
Klutzy draconequis.
Works for me.

04:04.590 --> 04:06.280
I'll definitely
remember it.

04:19.410 --> 04:22.600
<i>OK. I am definitely</i>
<i>glad you came.</i>

04:22.880 --> 04:25.285
I don't think we'd be able
to find our way without you.

04:25.665 --> 04:26.945
You definitely wouldn't.

04:28.705 --> 04:30.365
Um... Where's the way out?

04:30.615 --> 04:33.920
It's a Changeling Hive. It
shifts and changes like we do

04:34.195 --> 04:36.155
and we're the only ones
who can navigate it.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.360
It's total chaos to
non-Changelings.

04:40.020 --> 04:44.280
Well, it's decent chaos. I don't
know if I'd call it total.

04:46.185 --> 04:48.325
Are we sure that
I'll get my magic back

04:48.380 --> 04:50.875
when we destroy
this throne-thingy?

04:51.595 --> 04:53.790
If Thorax is
right, then yes.

04:54.090 --> 04:56.110
Well, that's reassuring.

04:56.465 --> 04:58.320
And how are we supposed
to destroy the throne

04:58.355 --> 04:59.335
when we find it?

04:59.620 --> 05:02.740
I... don't know.

05:03.195 --> 05:04.650
That's reassuring.

05:06.750 --> 05:09.435
I don't suppose you brought
any throne-destroying tools

05:09.475 --> 05:12.340
along with these
useless side show props?

05:12.595 --> 05:15.795
Asks the "lord of chaos"
who can't go for a walk

05:15.860 --> 05:17.725
without whining non-stop.

05:18.165 --> 05:20.225
Yes, but when the
throne is destroyed,

05:20.295 --> 05:23.395
I'LL be able to rip the
very fabric of reality

05:23.420 --> 05:26.260
to save our friends
while YOU'LL still be

05:26.310 --> 05:30.510
a self-absorbed,
below-average illusionist.

05:30.735 --> 05:33.640
SELF-ABSORBED?! Why you--

05:33.700 --> 05:35.935
CUT! IT! OUT!

05:36.080 --> 05:37.720
I'm just barely
keeping it together

05:37.795 --> 05:40.695
and it would be WONDERFUL if you
two could actually try to help

05:40.835 --> 05:42.720
instead of bickering like foals.

05:45.055 --> 05:46.240
OK.

05:46.465 --> 05:47.535
How can we help?

05:47.785 --> 05:50.655
Don't ask me! I couldn't
even handle giving advice

05:50.680 --> 05:53.755
at the Sunset Festival
and I HAD magic then!

05:53.940 --> 05:56.030
And the three of us
are as good as useless.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.530
At least Thorax knows
where we're going.

05:58.740 --> 06:00.395
<i>Um... guys?</i>

06:01.140 --> 06:02.290
I think we're lost.

06:02.775 --> 06:04.290
<i> Aww, great!</i>

06:04.555 --> 06:06.710
We might as well just
sit here and wait

06:06.785 --> 06:09.620
for the Changelings to
soak up all of our love

06:09.655 --> 06:12.565
or whatever gross thing
it is that they do.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.170
How often do you
all get hungry?

06:15.890 --> 06:19.205
Actually, I haven't
been since I met Spike.

06:19.375 --> 06:21.580
And Changelings
are always hungry.

06:21.775 --> 06:23.460
We can never get
enough love.

06:23.685 --> 06:25.495
Well, that's just super.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.490
But you aren't
hungry at all now?

06:29.710 --> 06:32.470
Once I made a few friends,
I guess I just sort of...

06:32.680 --> 06:35.085
forgot about the
whole feeding thing.

06:35.460 --> 06:38.600
Is that about the same
time your wings changed?

06:39.375 --> 06:40.390
I guess so.

06:41.805 --> 06:44.410
While I would love to
sit around chit-chatting

06:44.435 --> 06:46.625
about feeding and
not feeding.

06:46.750 --> 06:50.245
I have a FLUTTERSHY to save!

06:54.915 --> 06:58.040
Can you please lower your voice?

06:58.160 --> 06:59.945
You're going to get
us all captured!

07:00.285 --> 07:02.270
Oh! You keep saying
that, but I haven't seen

07:02.295 --> 07:05.405
an actual Changeling since
we got into this hive.

07:06.710 --> 07:08.295
What's that!?

07:08.710 --> 07:10.495
A CHANGELING PATROL!

07:20.275 --> 07:23.935
This seems like one of those
moments where we need a plan.

07:24.075 --> 07:25.515
What kind of plan?

07:25.645 --> 07:26.680
We have no magic

07:26.735 --> 07:29.325
and it's not like my illusions
are going to save us.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.610
Do you have any of
your smoke bombs?

07:31.820 --> 07:32.985
Are you kidding?

07:35.915 --> 07:37.685
Looking for somepony?

07:40.335 --> 07:43.815
Is that the best
you've got? Hahaha!

07:54.775 --> 07:58.035
Not exactly Great and
Powerful, but effective.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.285
Mh, I'll take it.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.800
Klutzy...

08:03.130 --> 08:04.475
Draconequis.

08:06.105 --> 08:09.740
I really think we
need a new code word.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.655
That was a pretty
good plan.

08:11.935 --> 08:13.990
But we still don't
know where we're going.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.480
<i> Actually, we might.</i>

08:15.835 --> 08:18.070
Two of the Changelings
didn't go with the rest.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.910
Oh! With an intruder
in the hive,

08:20.955 --> 08:22.895
they went to
protect the Queen.

08:23.215 --> 08:24.830
Good thinking,
Starlight!

08:40.125 --> 08:41.705
Now what?

08:42.120 --> 08:43.935
We go in.

08:44.130 --> 08:47.525
Even if I wanted to, there's
no way past the guards.

08:47.575 --> 08:49.190
We'll be spotted for sure.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.940
We need some kind
of distraction.

08:52.205 --> 08:54.055
I'm fresh out of
smoke bombs.

08:54.340 --> 08:56.440
Normally I'm the most
distracting thing

08:56.470 --> 08:58.895
I can think of, but
without magic...

08:59.935 --> 09:01.920
You shouldn't
underestimate yourself.

09:08.435 --> 09:12.030
Hello, Changelings and
Changelettes, believe me;

09:12.070 --> 09:14.525
I was just as surprised
as you are that I'm here.

09:14.665 --> 09:17.520
When I heard that I'd be playing
for a bunch of Changelings,

09:17.555 --> 09:21.955
I was beside myself. Then I
realized it was just one of you.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.460
But seriously, this
isn't the toughest crowd

09:26.485 --> 09:27.635
I've ever been in front of,

09:27.850 --> 09:30.515
but it's definitely
the easiest to bug.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.175
To bug...

09:33.480 --> 09:34.800
Is this thing on?

09:39.960 --> 09:42.485
Well, if you think that
you can do any better,

09:42.530 --> 09:44.105
be my guest!

09:46.590 --> 09:48.915
It is absolutely ridiculous
that that worked.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.180
It is certainly a pleasure
to have such dedicated fans.

09:57.345 --> 09:58.970
I'll have to come back
with some new material

09:58.995 --> 10:00.945
after I rescue Fluttershy.

10:01.220 --> 10:04.025
<i> Please... Help...</i>

10:05.555 --> 10:07.040
Fluttershy!

10:07.430 --> 10:09.825
Discord! I'm stuck!

10:10.030 --> 10:11.280
You certainly are.

10:11.340 --> 10:14.035
And I should probably
help you get free, but...

10:14.435 --> 10:16.725
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

10:17.030 --> 10:18.190
But what?

10:18.435 --> 10:21.685
But you are obviously
not Fluttershy.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.015
Oh.

10:23.235 --> 10:24.915
I mean, I'm separated
from the group

10:24.960 --> 10:28.995
and just happen to come across
the one pony I care most about?

10:29.275 --> 10:31.585
I can smell this
set-up a mile away.

10:33.610 --> 10:35.770
No. You're right.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.255
There's no way you
should trust me.

10:38.855 --> 10:43.355
Just go find the
others. I understand.

10:43.925 --> 10:45.240
Oh, come on.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.540
We're probably
all Changelings.

10:52.725 --> 10:55.615
You shouldn't
rescue any of us.

10:55.870 --> 11:00.485
Unless you think maybe one of us
might be the real Fluttershy.

11:00.565 --> 11:05.065
That certainly would be a nasty
Changeling trick, wouldn't it?

11:05.755 --> 11:06.980
I'm the real one.

11:07.945 --> 11:09.240
I'm the real one.

11:09.785 --> 11:11.830
I'm the real
Fluttershy.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.935
We can't wait for Discord.
Between seeing him and Trixie,

11:19.080 --> 11:21.640
the castle will be
crawling with guards soon.

11:22.340 --> 11:25.085
But if we do manage to
destroy Chrysalis' throne,

11:25.120 --> 11:26.045
we'll need him.

11:26.220 --> 11:27.995
He could take on the
entire Changeling army

11:28.020 --> 11:29.635
by sneezing if he
wanted to.

11:29.910 --> 11:32.375
He's probably already
been captured.

11:32.700 --> 11:36.930
Hello? Fellow rescuers?

11:38.400 --> 11:41.275
We can't stay here. We've
got to find the throne!

11:41.320 --> 11:43.985
Oooh! I heard some
of the Changelings

11:44.075 --> 11:47.395
who were chasing me say
that they know where it is.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.305
Klutzy...

11:49.610 --> 11:55.540
Hmmmm? Oh, yeah haha. I can
be klutzy. Now, follow me!

11:57.175 --> 11:58.950
You know that's
not Discord, right?

11:59.210 --> 12:00.440
Obviously.

12:02.245 --> 12:04.680
This way! We're
almost there!

12:05.260 --> 12:07.680
I know this trick. If
he says to go left,

12:07.820 --> 12:09.470
we should definitely go right.

12:09.565 --> 12:11.885
He's leading us to a
swarm waiting to attack.

12:14.865 --> 12:16.510
OK, I'll handle it.

12:16.795 --> 12:19.140
You two just get ready to
run into the other tunnel.

12:19.290 --> 12:21.725
Wait, what!? Trixie
you can't.

12:21.965 --> 12:24.670
I won't know what to do.
We've already lost Discord.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.005
I can't lose you too.
Without magic I--

12:27.030 --> 12:30.315
Starlight, you got us this
far with just my illusions

12:30.345 --> 12:32.565
and Discord's
annoying personality.

12:32.745 --> 12:35.575
You don't need magic to
figure out what to do next.

12:35.790 --> 12:37.905
I know you're afraid
to be in charge,

12:38.180 --> 12:42.660
but you're really good at it.
Listen to your best friend.

12:44.825 --> 12:48.450
Hey, Discord? Wanna see the new
trick I've been working on?

12:49.665 --> 12:52.820
I call it, "The
Changeling Catcher!"

12:53.095 --> 12:55.195
Run!

13:41.625 --> 13:49.115
One little pony
all by herself.

13:52.175 --> 13:56.335
Oh, how will I ever
prevent this daring rescue?

14:07.550 --> 14:13.265
Well, well, well. The Princess
of Friendship's sole pupil.

14:13.475 --> 14:16.895
Honestly, I didn't think
you were worth replacing

14:16.930 --> 14:18.460
with one of my drones.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.715
You won't get away with this!

14:21.980 --> 14:25.960
I already have. Nopony
is coming to save you.

14:26.360 --> 14:31.945
Your little squad was it,
and now there's just you.

14:32.275 --> 14:33.890
Thorax is still out there.

14:33.990 --> 14:36.430
Don't mention that traitor's
name in my Kingdom!

14:36.670 --> 14:40.160
He was a fool to leave and
even more a fool to return.

14:40.700 --> 14:44.565
When I find him he'll
learn just what happens

14:44.610 --> 14:46.830
to those who betray the hive.

14:49.460 --> 14:53.095
And it seems I don't
have far to look, do I.

14:55.605 --> 14:56.520
Thorax!

15:05.120 --> 15:10.055
Very clever. And clearly Thorax
revealed to you the secret

15:10.090 --> 15:13.670
of my throne. I can't
have powerful ponies

15:13.720 --> 15:15.640
using their
abilities against me.

15:16.055 --> 15:18.080
Even with your
rather embarrassing

15:18.145 --> 15:20.920
little rescue attempt,
everything has gone

15:20.965 --> 15:23.270
according to MY plan.

15:23.785 --> 15:26.405
What plan? Why did
you do all this?

15:26.460 --> 15:28.410
So I could feed, of course!

15:28.615 --> 15:32.375
By replacing the most beloved
figures in Equestria,

15:32.435 --> 15:36.040
my drones will be able to store
all the love meant for them

15:36.255 --> 15:38.590
and return it here... to me.

15:39.245 --> 15:43.225
Everypony will do as I
command and my subjects

15:43.250 --> 15:50.130
and I will feed on their love
for generations!

15:52.780 --> 15:54.600
What if you
didn't have to?

15:55.045 --> 15:56.715
Ridiculous!

15:57.660 --> 16:01.285
The hunger of Changelings
can never be satisfied.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.645
Exactly. Thorax left the
hive and made a friend.

16:05.865 --> 16:09.320
He shared love and now
he doesn't need to feed!

16:09.510 --> 16:12.530
You don't have to live your
lives starving all the time!

16:13.635 --> 16:15.835
You know nothing
of the Changelings

16:15.910 --> 16:17.890
or what it takes
to be their Queen!

16:19.370 --> 16:24.155
I decide what is best for my
subjects, not some mewling grub!

16:24.410 --> 16:27.875
I know what it's like to lead
by fear and intimidation.

16:27.965 --> 16:29.510
And I know
what it's like

16:29.545 --> 16:32.015
to want everypony
to do what you say.

16:32.155 --> 16:36.125
But I was wrong. A real leader
doesn't force her subjects

16:36.170 --> 16:37.910
to deny who they are.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.505
She celebrates what
makes them unique...

16:40.685 --> 16:43.295
...and listens when one of
them finds a better way.

16:43.785 --> 16:46.515
The only thing
Thorax has found...

16:46.740 --> 16:50.125
...is what happens to those who
turn their back on the hive!

16:51.380 --> 16:52.855
No! Stop!

16:53.865 --> 16:57.485
Just as soon as I drain every
last ounce of love from him

16:57.655 --> 17:00.875
and show my subjects
what a real leader is.

17:02.645 --> 17:05.655
I can feel the love
inside me slipping away.

17:06.055 --> 17:08.225
I can't hold onto
it much longer.

17:08.710 --> 17:10.185
Then don't!

17:10.330 --> 17:12.875
Sharing love is what made
you different to begin with.

17:13.055 --> 17:15.260
You should share
yours with Chrysalis.

17:15.530 --> 17:17.100
Give her all of it.

17:38.545 --> 17:41.020
This is what happens
when you give love freely

17:41.100 --> 17:42.630
instead of taking it.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.135
Fluttershy?

18:18.950 --> 18:22.165
It's, um, good to see you too.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.740
Starlight?

18:26.560 --> 18:27.695
What happened?

18:28.020 --> 18:30.825
We defeated the Changelings
with no magic at all;

18:30.990 --> 18:32.455
they found a new leader...

18:32.680 --> 18:36.215
and they're all
kinda good now.

18:39.615 --> 18:41.090
Well done, Starlight Glimmer.

18:41.265 --> 18:42.930
It seems as though you've
learned a great deal

18:42.985 --> 18:44.245
since we last spoke.

18:54.245 --> 18:56.170
When Twilight and her
friends defeated me,

18:56.210 --> 19:00.245
I chose to run away and seek
revenge. You don't have to.

19:00.415 --> 19:03.215
You can be the leader
your subjects deserve.

19:10.535 --> 19:13.275
There is no revenge you
could ever conceive of

19:13.315 --> 19:15.850
that will come close to
what I will exact upon you

19:15.890 --> 19:18.555
one day, Starlight Glimmer!

19:27.150 --> 19:29.755
Thorax, as the new leader
of the Changelings,

19:29.785 --> 19:32.925
I look forward to discussing how
we can improve our relationship

19:32.990 --> 19:33.945
in the future.

19:34.830 --> 19:37.590
However, for the moment,
perhaps it is best

19:37.625 --> 19:41.460
that we leave the Changeling
Kingdom to the Changelings.

19:42.855 --> 19:45.415
Splendid idea!
Now who's ready

19:45.470 --> 19:49.245
for some celebratory
tea at Fluttershy's?

19:49.780 --> 19:52.045
Oh. Um. Everypony?

19:52.865 --> 19:55.355
Actually, now that you
can snap your claws

19:55.395 --> 19:57.455
and send us absolutely
anywhere again,

19:57.595 --> 19:59.730
I think I have a
better option.

20:02.835 --> 20:06.270
Uh.. Hey Starlight.
What are you doing here?

20:06.540 --> 20:08.450
You left in such
a hurry before,

20:08.685 --> 20:10.840
we kinda thought you
didn't want to come.

20:11.385 --> 20:15.005
Yeah. I guess after the way I
used my magic on all of you,

20:15.020 --> 20:17.405
I wasn't sure I was somepony
who should even be in charge

20:17.445 --> 20:20.645
of a baking contest. I was
afraid I might go back

20:20.710 --> 20:23.950
to being the pony I
used to be. But...

20:24.080 --> 20:26.935
...I realized that sometimes
you don't have a choice.

20:27.135 --> 20:32.090
You have to step up. And I
HAVE changed. I can handle it.

20:32.175 --> 20:34.855
Whether than means saving
Equestria OR helping friends

20:34.885 --> 20:38.370
with a sunset festival.
Speaking of which...

20:38.725 --> 20:42.370
...I know the festival is almost
over, but I kinda invited

20:42.395 --> 20:44.745
a few of my
friends to join.

20:46.470 --> 20:47.690
Hope that's OK.

20:48.605 --> 20:51.885
Are you kidding? Of course!

20:51.965 --> 20:55.100
Great. Now, where's
that baking contest?

20:55.210 --> 20:57.350
This pony needs a cupcake!

21:00.260 --> 21:04.830
So I'm able to rip the very
fabric of reality again.

21:04.965 --> 21:07.920
Yeah, yeah and I'm
still a self-absorbed,

21:07.975 --> 21:10.200
below-average
illusionist. Right?

21:10.530 --> 21:13.400
Actually, I was going to say
a COUPLE of those illusions

21:13.440 --> 21:15.610
were slightly above average.

21:15.770 --> 21:19.330
If you ever need a little chaos
in your act, let me know.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.865
Ha! When pigs fly!

21:23.250 --> 21:25.965
Your wish is my command!

21:28.395 --> 21:30.585
Whoa-whoaaaa!

21:31.400 --> 21:35.905
Somepony is really gonna have to
catch us up on what we missed.
