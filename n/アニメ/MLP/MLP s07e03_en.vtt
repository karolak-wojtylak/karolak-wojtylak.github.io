WEBVTT

00:03.908 --> 00:05.312
Oh, Princess Twilight,

00:05.444 --> 00:07.868
everypony at the
hospital is so excited

00:07.932 --> 00:09.044
for your visit today!

00:09.368 --> 00:12.644
I'm never too busy to visit
sick foals! I can't believe

00:12.668 --> 00:15.656
a whole class just came
down with the Horsey Hives.

00:15.820 --> 00:18.176
... on school
picture day, too!

00:20.752 --> 00:24.484
Oh! The poor dears really
do need cheering up.

00:24.816 --> 00:25.928
We'll do our best!

00:26.120 --> 00:28.912
We'll bring snacks; I'll read
to them and get them gifts.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.892
Food and presents
always cheer me up!

00:35.332 --> 00:36.448
We'll see you soon.

00:38.752 --> 00:41.588
OK, if we want to be at
the hospital by lunch,

00:41.736 --> 00:43.928
then we have three hours
to buy get-well presents,

00:43.976 --> 00:45.408
borrow a book from
the schoolhouse

00:45.836 --> 00:47.496
and pick up treats.

00:48.332 --> 00:50.556
It's a lot, but if we
stick to the schedule,

00:50.592 --> 00:52.404
I know we can get
it all done.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.128
Yeah, knock on wood!

00:58.076 --> 00:59.788
Surprise!

01:02.092 --> 01:03.396
Oh, my gosh!

01:05.184 --> 01:07.108
How's my
favorite niece?

01:08.236 --> 01:11.284
I'm good! I was hoping
my favorite aunt

01:11.316 --> 01:13.492
could watch me for
a few hours!

01:13.556 --> 01:14.984
I hope you're
not too busy!

01:15.856 --> 01:16.944
Actually, we kind of are--

01:17.772 --> 01:20.996
Busy? Psh! Would the Best
Aunt Ever be "too busy"

01:21.016 --> 01:23.548
to spend time with this
adorable little one?

01:26.228 --> 01:26.828
No!

02:11.032 --> 02:14.572
Flur-ry, I've got
a surprise for you!

02:21.712 --> 02:24.348
Just a couple of toys that
reminded me of Flurry!

02:30.984 --> 02:32.064
I'm excited to show you

02:32.084 --> 02:34.104
I've done some shopping
for Flurry Heart!

02:34.884 --> 02:38.944
You're so sweet. You
didn't have to do all that!

02:39.224 --> 02:41.108
I know, but I
can't help myself!

02:41.528 --> 02:43.688
Best! Aunt! Ever!

02:44.872 --> 02:45.996
Open this one, Flurry!

02:54.600 --> 02:58.780
Exactly! They're bears!
You're one smart cookie!

03:28.180 --> 03:30.768
We'll just put Flurry's
things over here, Twiley!

03:31.064 --> 03:32.264
Uh huh, totally!

03:34.244 --> 03:35.940
Mashed peas:
her favorite.

03:36.112 --> 03:41.408
And diapers, extra diapers,
oh and backup extra diapers.

03:42.240 --> 03:46.000
Mashed peas: her favorite.
Wait. Did I say that already?

03:47.844 --> 03:48.596
Uh-huh.

03:49.412 --> 03:50.172
Whoops.

03:50.556 --> 03:54.156
Oh! And this is the most
important thing of all!

03:54.332 --> 03:55.292
Her "whammy".

03:56.344 --> 03:57.868
I take it Flurry named it?

03:58.264 --> 04:01.324
Yup. If she gets fussy,
just give her the whammy

04:01.360 --> 04:02.936
and she'll calm
right down.

04:03.132 --> 04:04.908
You getting all
this, Twiley?

04:05.244 --> 04:06.060
Whammy! Got it!

04:07.884 --> 04:09.188
Where are you guys
headed anyway?

04:09.456 --> 04:12.588
You remember my friend from
the royal guard, Spearhead?

04:14.644 --> 04:17.956
Honestly, all of your friends'
names are very similar.

04:18.260 --> 04:21.364
Well, he has a pop-up art
show at the Ponyville Cafe

04:21.540 --> 04:23.388
and we decided to go
at the last minute.

04:23.620 --> 04:25.672
We're not exactly
art enthusiasts

04:25.708 --> 04:27.828
but we could really
use a night out.

04:28.128 --> 04:29.128
You mean day?

04:29.452 --> 04:31.276
That's what I said.
Isn't that what I said?

04:33.520 --> 04:36.336
Either way, are you
sure you can watch her?

04:37.776 --> 04:38.736
Uh uh uh!

04:41.364 --> 04:46.448
Have no fear! The Best-Aunt-Ever
has everything under control!

04:50.532 --> 04:52.088
Thanks again, Twiley!

04:53.628 --> 04:55.884
OK, let's grab that
wharmmy thing and go!

05:00.556 --> 05:03.300
Ooh, you wanna pretend
we're the bears?

05:03.952 --> 05:06.116
I suppose we have
time for a quick game.

05:08.352 --> 05:09.284
Do we though?

05:10.024 --> 05:10.668
Hey!

05:10.732 --> 05:13.812
All right, rawr!
I'm gonna getcha!

05:15.460 --> 05:16.096
Agh!

05:18.696 --> 05:21.360
You should catch her soon
cause we've got lots to do!

05:21.660 --> 05:24.232
Horsey-hive covered foals
counting on us, remember?

05:24.920 --> 05:32.324
Got it. Rawr, rawr!
I'm catching up! Rawr!

05:36.720 --> 05:38.608
RAWWWWWR!

05:41.716 --> 05:44.652
Uh oh. Sorry, bug.
Did that scare you?

05:46.492 --> 05:49.104
It's OK! It's just
Auntie Twiley!

05:56.192 --> 05:58.288
You know, that was a
very advanced spell

05:58.332 --> 05:59.740
for somepony your age.

06:00.076 --> 06:03.064
Looks like you're already taking
after your Auntie Twiley!

06:07.596 --> 06:11.244
All right, that was pretty
adorable. But now--

06:11.640 --> 06:13.044
I know, Spike. We're leaving.

06:16.616 --> 06:18.036
I just have to feed
her real quick.

06:39.264 --> 06:43.516
Is this art...
or a mistake?

06:43.844 --> 06:45.136
I have no idea.

06:45.612 --> 06:48.064
But who cares? We're
not changing diapers.

06:48.656 --> 06:52.420
Shining Armor! Cadance!
How are the new 'rents?!

06:52.592 --> 06:53.744
Give me some hoof!

06:56.268 --> 07:02.232
It is so! Good! To see you
dudes! Thanks for coming!

07:02.564 --> 07:05.048
Of course! We're
having a great time!

07:05.180 --> 07:07.220
Loving all the art!

07:08.540 --> 07:10.052
Uh, that's a trash can.

07:14.132 --> 07:16.536
So it is. I knew that!

07:17.052 --> 07:18.732
But hey, who's to
say it's not art?

07:18.812 --> 07:20.564
Art can be anything
that speaks to you.

07:20.652 --> 07:22.040
It changed my world.

07:23.504 --> 07:29.304
This is my latest piece: A
Thousand Nights in a Hallway.

07:29.496 --> 07:33.952
Wow, I guess nighttime in a
hallway can be pretty dark.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.844
There is none more dark.

07:36.388 --> 07:38.152
Yeah. Totally.

07:39.780 --> 07:41.520
We're just so happy to be here!

07:41.648 --> 07:44.016
Usually we're covered
in mashed peas by now.

07:44.916 --> 07:47.284
When they said mashed
peas were her favorite--

07:51.460 --> 07:53.920
--did they mean her favorite
thing to decorate a room with?

07:59.348 --> 08:01.672
Aw, come on, Spike.
That wasn't too bad!

08:02.120 --> 08:05.340
Yeah and we're only twenty
minutes behind schedule.

08:06.384 --> 08:11.560
Twenty minutes? It's fine.
We can totally do this.

08:20.008 --> 08:23.380
OK, we just need to grab some
toys and we are out of here!

08:26.380 --> 08:27.708
Rawrr!

08:28.908 --> 08:30.456
You want to play, don't you?

08:33.856 --> 08:36.152
Well, I know a game
that's even more fun...

08:36.392 --> 08:37.684
and more efficient.

08:37.940 --> 08:40.188
Playing race cart! Ha ha!

08:44.972 --> 08:46.228
Woohoo!

08:52.548 --> 08:54.256
Hey, nice thinking, Twilight!

08:54.676 --> 08:56.628
Best-Aunt-Ever!

08:57.124 --> 08:59.608
Hang on, Flurry. The race
cart's taking a pit-stop.

09:20.388 --> 09:23.376
I'm not a detective, but
I think we've got a suspect.

09:23.616 --> 09:24.364
Ah!

09:27.740 --> 09:29.504
Well, we'd better
get to cleaning.

09:29.702 --> 09:31.020
We've got no
time to waste!

09:33.155 --> 09:35.523
Thanks, but they were
organized by color.

09:47.814 --> 09:50.912
Yes! We gained back a whole
five minutes from running here!

09:51.145 --> 09:53.420
Yeah, but if you add
that to the 40 minutes

09:53.449 --> 09:57.830
we were already behind, we're
still... 55 minutes behind.

09:59.398 --> 10:01.468
I mean... yay, team?

10:01.750 --> 10:02.492
Mmhmm!

10:04.588 --> 10:07.436
Thanks for helping us out,
Cheerilee! Sorry we were late.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.017
Oh, no problem!

10:09.363 --> 10:11.296
But I gotta say, I'm
surprised you came to me

10:11.350 --> 10:14.297
for a book. Don't you
have a huge collection?

10:14.931 --> 10:18.793
Yes, but...
sorry, one second--

10:26.992 --> 10:28.585
I didn't think the
foals would be interested

10:28.601 --> 10:32.016
in The Unabridged History
of Amulets in Pony Latin.

10:32.323 --> 10:34.470
Yeah. It was good
you came to me.

10:34.662 --> 10:36.246
How about the
complete collection

10:36.265 --> 10:38.684
of "Ponyville
Fables and Stables"

10:40.662 --> 10:41.990
Mm, too long.

10:42.860 --> 10:45.001
"Alien Alicorns
vs. Space Pirates"?

10:45.337 --> 10:47.094
Well, the science
there is preposterous.

10:47.129 --> 10:49.148
How about Burnferno:
Warrior from Within?!

10:49.696 --> 10:52.265
It's about a handsome dragon
warrior who slays evildoers

10:52.294 --> 10:55.084
with his breath and
his snappy comebacks!

10:56.390 --> 11:00.547
Let's borrow that for you
and keep looking. What else?

11:10.430 --> 11:13.561
How about "Gusty
the Great"?

11:13.801 --> 11:15.904
Ooh! That was one
of my favorites

11:15.939 --> 11:17.926
when I was a filly!
We'll take it!

11:18.934 --> 11:21.868
Um... should I go with
something more current?

11:23.926 --> 11:24.876
<i> ♪ Ta da! ♪</i>

11:25.523 --> 11:29.526
Cheerilee! I am so, so sorry.
I didn't even hear her leave.

11:38.940 --> 11:40.432
There! All clean!

11:40.665 --> 11:44.928
Great. Now I'll just write
it up again. With my mouth.

11:48.192 --> 11:49.296
Feast your eyes.

11:49.619 --> 11:52.764
This one's called 'A
Kitchen Guard's journey'.

11:53.206 --> 11:54.355
Oh...

11:54.691 --> 11:56.166
This reminds me
of the time

11:56.275 --> 11:58.316
Flurry got into the
chocolate pudding

11:58.608 --> 12:02.352
and we found little chocolate
hoofprints all over the carpet.

12:02.473 --> 12:04.771
That took forever
to clean up!

12:04.950 --> 12:07.004
But remember how cute
her little face looked

12:07.056 --> 12:08.320
when we caught her?

12:08.448 --> 12:11.360
Yeah she was
like... uh oh!

12:13.024 --> 12:15.075
Whoa! Art is
so evocative.

12:15.164 --> 12:18.067
I wasn't even going
for that memory! Score!

12:20.748 --> 12:22.883
Honestly, Twilight, I
don't even want to tell you

12:22.912 --> 12:23.868
how late we are.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.060
Should I just cancel our
visit to the hospital?

12:26.432 --> 12:29.568
What? Cancel? We
can't cancel, Spike!

12:29.868 --> 12:31.616
The sick foals are
counting on us!

12:31.894 --> 12:34.992
And the B.A.E. would never
throw in the towel like that!

12:35.305 --> 12:36.681
B.A.E.?

12:36.889 --> 12:38.355
Best-Aunt-Ever!

12:38.649 --> 12:40.713
Besides, this errand is
going to be different!

12:41.283 --> 12:42.540
How do you figure that?

12:42.787 --> 12:44.995
Because Flurry can play
with the Cake twins

12:45.049 --> 12:47.715
and stay out of
trouble! Best Aunt Ever!

12:57.392 --> 12:59.507
Wonderful, they're
friends already!

12:59.744 --> 13:01.312
Huh! I shouldn't
have doubted you.

13:01.446 --> 13:03.798
Thanks. Wait,
you doubted me?

13:04.713 --> 13:07.798
Spike, you watch Flurry; I'll
take care of everything else.

13:10.697 --> 13:12.707
Hi Pinkie, how's it going? I
need to pick up the cupcakes

13:12.729 --> 13:14.966
for the foals at the hospital
and can you do apology treats?

13:15.449 --> 13:18.041
I'm good. Here they
are. Of course I can!

13:18.614 --> 13:21.219
Do you still have a giant file
of everypony's favorite treat?

13:21.430 --> 13:22.969
In my secret party
planning cave.

13:25.315 --> 13:25.856
BRB!

13:28.944 --> 13:32.188
He he! Remind me to tell you
later how amazing you are.

13:32.403 --> 13:33.020
Cheerilee?

13:33.699 --> 13:34.758
I am pretty awesome.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.561
Cherry oatmeal cookies
with yellow sprinkles.

13:39.984 --> 13:42.179
Great! Can you write
"sorry" on them?

13:42.345 --> 13:43.894
I've got a stamp for that.

13:59.718 --> 14:02.230
Hey, you guys.
no need to fight.

14:03.129 --> 14:05.036
Hang on! I'm sure
there's another one!

14:14.310 --> 14:16.160
Hold on, sweetie!
We'll play in a second!

14:30.489 --> 14:32.278
The salespony at
the toy store.

14:32.611 --> 14:34.876
Apple strudel cupcake
with caramel drizzle!

14:44.665 --> 14:47.401
Oh, no. You're making the
same face Cheerilee made.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.723
Pinkie, remind me what
your favorite treat is.

14:57.632 --> 14:58.966
The sampler platter.

14:59.260 --> 15:00.460
We'll take
three of those.

15:02.627 --> 15:04.777
A-ha! told you I'd
find another one.

15:06.960 --> 15:07.824
Heh heh.

15:12.486 --> 15:13.926
Uh, Twilight!

15:14.124 --> 15:16.665
Out of the question! We
are NOT cancelling!

15:16.838 --> 15:18.540
It's going to be
OK! It has to be OK!

15:18.585 --> 15:19.814
It's been so
terrible so far

15:19.846 --> 15:21.670
that it can't possibly
end up [splat]

15:23.478 --> 15:24.156
Sorry.

15:26.422 --> 15:27.929
No, I needed it.

15:28.393 --> 15:30.480
I was just gonna
say... we're here.

15:33.894 --> 15:35.836
And we're only
four-and-a-half minutes late!

15:36.006 --> 15:36.886
Four-and-a-half?

15:38.662 --> 15:41.478
"And while nopony had ever
tried to reach Cloudsdale

15:41.497 --> 15:44.176
on hoof, Gusty the
Great was not deterred.

15:44.278 --> 15:47.049
She and her unicorn warriors
marched up the hill--

15:47.299 --> 15:49.286
but suddenly they encountered--"

15:50.096 --> 15:51.596
What?! What was it?!

15:52.582 --> 15:54.857
"It was the
treacherous Grogar!

15:55.043 --> 15:57.417
And Gusty could tell he
was ready for battle.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.137
Gusty called out to
the unicorn warriors--"

16:00.163 --> 16:00.864
OW!"

16:01.699 --> 16:05.014
Not right now, Flurry, these
foals really want to hear this.

16:07.404 --> 16:09.616
"'We can fight
Grogar... TOGETHER!'

16:09.708 --> 16:13.395
And the unicorn warriors shot
magical beams into the clouds

16:13.654 --> 16:15.036
that wove into one.

16:15.238 --> 16:18.454
The beam, stronger than a
thousand armies, shined down.

16:18.633 --> 16:21.507
It wrapped around Grogar and
pulled him to the ground.

16:21.843 --> 16:23.708
Don't let him escape!'
yelled Gusty!"--

16:30.070 --> 16:31.843
Say aaaaah!

16:31.971 --> 16:34.528
Aaah!

16:42.864 --> 16:45.488
"Grogar was strong,
for fear gave him power

16:46.201 --> 16:47.808
and he broke
through the bonds--"

16:53.004 --> 16:54.480
I know! So good, right?!

16:54.630 --> 16:55.926
Twilight! Look up!

16:56.454 --> 16:58.598
Spike! You're floating!
YOU'RE FLOATING!

16:58.870 --> 16:59.952
So are you!

17:04.073 --> 17:06.217
Flurry, honey, you
need to stop this.

17:06.502 --> 17:07.974
Get us down, please!

17:08.268 --> 17:09.884
Twilight, look out!

17:21.248 --> 17:24.003
Nopony panic! Everything's
going to be OK!

17:40.921 --> 17:42.995
Ah! I can't keep up with her!

17:43.049 --> 17:44.892
Oh, yeah! Where's her snoozal?

17:45.049 --> 17:45.814
Her what?

17:46.294 --> 17:48.476
You know her, whacky,
wompy-thing, the snail!

17:48.608 --> 17:50.691
Where is it? Cadance
said it calms her down!

17:50.822 --> 17:51.734
I don't see it!

18:01.907 --> 18:05.321
FLURRY HEART! PUT US
ALL DOWN THIS INSTANT!

18:11.224 --> 18:12.390
Is everypony OK?

18:16.323 --> 18:18.617
Flurry that was
very, very bad!

18:18.838 --> 18:20.080
You could have
hurt somepony.

18:25.094 --> 18:26.976
Oh, Flurry, I didn't mean to--

18:28.147 --> 18:31.264
Sweetie, you don't have to be
scared; it's just me. See?

18:33.718 --> 18:36.425
You're scared of me.
Because I yelled at you.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.364
Like a big scary bear.

18:38.758 --> 18:42.172
Flurry, I'm so sorry. I've
been a terrible aunt today.

18:42.633 --> 18:44.428
All you wanted to do was play

18:44.707 --> 18:47.110
and I've barely been able to
pay attention to you.

18:47.545 --> 18:50.092
None of this is your
fault. It's mine.

18:50.412 --> 18:52.748
So much for being
the Best Aunt Ever.

18:53.168 --> 18:55.104
But I hope you know
how much I love you.

18:59.116 --> 19:00.502
I take it you forgive me?

19:01.724 --> 19:04.332
Thanks, Flurry. How
about we head home?

19:05.235 --> 19:07.392
After we find your
whammy, of course!

19:07.468 --> 19:08.646
Ahem!

19:12.588 --> 19:13.465
And clean up.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.489
This one kind of reminds
me of Flurry's hair.

19:21.049 --> 19:23.680
And this one reminds
me of Flurry, too.

19:23.942 --> 19:24.748
How so?

19:25.072 --> 19:27.724
It's small, like her.

19:28.425 --> 19:29.939
I can't do this
anymore.

19:30.124 --> 19:32.323
Spearhead, this has
been great but--

19:32.348 --> 19:33.228
Say no more.

19:33.526 --> 19:36.604
My art has always spoken
to me about what I love,

19:36.969 --> 19:39.545
but knowing that it spoke
to you about what you love,

19:39.881 --> 19:41.200
speaks to me.

19:41.763 --> 19:42.288
What?

19:42.665 --> 19:43.628
Go to her!

20:02.515 --> 20:04.736
Flurry? Where's our
little foal?

20:08.489 --> 20:10.624
We missed you so much!

20:17.136 --> 20:20.054
But it looks like you had
a great time without us.

20:20.286 --> 20:23.854
Actually, not so much. Flurry
got into some mischief.

20:24.336 --> 20:25.568
But it wasn't her fault.

20:26.048 --> 20:27.446
I shouldn't have
agreed to watch her

20:27.460 --> 20:29.260
with such a
jam-packed schedule.

20:29.740 --> 20:31.334
It was too much
to juggle.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.025
But Flurry taught me an
important lesson today.

20:34.492 --> 20:36.544
It turns out being the
Best Aunt Ever

20:36.592 --> 20:39.056
isn't about spending the
most time with your niece,

20:39.430 --> 20:41.481
but spending quality
time with her.

20:42.163 --> 20:44.681
And she taught me a
really cool "bear" game,

20:45.027 --> 20:46.774
so I guess I learned two things.

20:50.169 --> 20:52.627
Well, we definitely
should have given you

20:52.656 --> 20:53.942
more of a head's up.

20:54.112 --> 20:57.526
Yes! From now on, we'll
give you plenty of notice.

20:58.588 --> 20:59.532
That would be great!

20:59.699 --> 21:01.510
Hey, what are you doing
next Tuesday?

21:02.512 --> 21:04.320
For dinner! Not to babysit.

21:05.481 --> 21:08.761
I'll have to check with Spike,
but I think we're free.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.828
Where is Spike, anyway?

21:11.328 --> 21:13.248
"... the dashing dragon warrior

21:13.344 --> 21:15.680
breathed a scorching
flame from his snout

21:16.220 --> 21:19.401
then chuckled to himself
as he flew into the sunset.

21:19.670 --> 21:23.113
'If you can't stand the heat,
don't fight a dragon..'"

21:23.283 --> 21:25.583
Hey, you kinda
look like him!

21:26.064 --> 21:26.998
Thank you.

21:27.516 --> 21:29.267
OK. Now who wants more cake?!
