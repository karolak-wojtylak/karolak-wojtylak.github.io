WEBVTT

00:12.513 --> 00:13.946
You said it,
Big Mac!

00:14.148 --> 00:16.015
This is taking FOREVER!

00:17.017 --> 00:18.183
I know it's wrong
to cut corners

00:18.285 --> 00:19.585
when it comes to
gifts from the heart,

00:19.686 --> 00:21.786
but this is
an emergency, right?

00:21.889 --> 00:22.554
Eyup.

00:22.656 --> 00:23.589
Discord?

00:23.691 --> 00:24.790
A little help?

00:24.892 --> 00:26.158
DISCORD!

00:31.098 --> 00:32.064
Good idea! Heh.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.183
Ahem.

00:33.684 --> 00:36.301
"Captain Wuzz, are you
prepared to enter the world

00:36.403 --> 00:38.470
of Ogres & Oubliettes?"

00:38.872 --> 00:41.173
Huzzah, fellow adventurers!

00:41.275 --> 00:44.043
Shall we storm the ramparts
of Squizard's Castle

00:44.145 --> 00:47.312
to reclaim Calico's Ring of
Imperceptibility?

00:49.483 --> 00:52.551
You did summon me for
a rousing Guys' Night

00:52.653 --> 00:55.020
of Ogres and Oubliettes,
did you not?

00:55.122 --> 00:57.456
Uh. Sort of, but...

00:57.558 --> 00:58.991
Do you think you could
magically hurry-up this pie

00:59.093 --> 00:59.959
real quick first?

01:00.561 --> 01:03.395
You seem to be mixing
up the Lord of Chaos

01:03.497 --> 01:06.899
with a second-rate clown
magician for hire.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.700
Uh! WAIT!

01:08.802 --> 01:10.402
This needs to go in
the mail today

01:10.504 --> 01:11.654
or it'll never get
to Sugar Belle

01:11.755 --> 01:13.405
in time for Hearts
and Hooves Day.

01:15.343 --> 01:19.178
Please, can't you see that that
holiday is a commercialized ruse

01:19.280 --> 01:22.414
pushed on you by the
greeting card industry?

01:22.516 --> 01:23.682
Big Mac: Ahem!

01:27.154 --> 01:28.387
Fine...

01:28.489 --> 01:30.055
You owe me for this.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.896
Keep your eye on the pie.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.999
It's magic time!

02:22.509 --> 02:26.011
This smells... palatable.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.947
Well, pies really are
Sugar Belle's thing.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.183
But I think that makes
this all the more special.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.385
It shows you're interested
in what she cares about.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.504
Eyup.

02:34.805 --> 02:36.622
And, he's planning
a big romantic

02:36.724 --> 02:38.074
Hearts and Hooves dinner.

02:38.175 --> 02:40.425
It was my idea to bake
the invitation inside.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.697
"Happy Hearts and
Hooves Day, Sugar Belle.

02:45.899 --> 02:50.201
Meet me in my barn at
sunset for a surprise."

02:50.303 --> 02:51.636
Pretty clever,
huh?

02:51.738 --> 02:53.705
Eyup.
[giggle]

03:00.914 --> 03:04.383
Aw, "Sugar
Belle." See?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.752
Well, you two certainly
have bought into this

03:07.854 --> 03:10.722
romance nonsense hook,
line, and sinker.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.024
For a formerly-friendless
immortal despot,

03:13.226 --> 03:14.459
you're pretty cynical.

03:14.561 --> 03:15.845
I'm a realist.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.730
And love, like all things
warm and fuzzy, isn't real.

03:20.133 --> 03:23.735
Aw, come on. You act
tough, but deep down

03:23.837 --> 03:25.104
you're a softie.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.472
I mean, you don't have tea with
Fluttershy every weekend

03:27.575 --> 03:29.207
because you like tea.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.176
But I do like tea!

03:31.278 --> 03:31.943
Every tea.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.279
All the teas.

03:33.981 --> 03:37.115
Chamomile, Earl Gray, green,
white, yellow, maté, lemon,

03:37.217 --> 03:40.220
ginger, chai, spearmint,
peppermint, hibiscus,

03:41.522 --> 03:43.656
cinnamon pumpkin spice!

03:47.394 --> 03:48.994
Tell you what:
while Big Mac mails

03:49.096 --> 03:50.696
his incredibly
romantic gesture,

03:50.797 --> 03:52.797
I'll show you the splendors
of Hearts and Hooves Day

03:52.900 --> 03:53.850
in Ponyville.

03:54.051 --> 03:56.101
I bet I can prove
you believe in love.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.504
Fine. Call it a
gentleman's wager.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.874
Loser mows my lawn
for eternity.

04:05.312 --> 04:07.479
Is it like a riding
mower, or...?

04:07.581 --> 04:08.947
Tweezers!

04:36.477 --> 04:37.976
Apple Bloom: Hear ye, hear ye!

04:38.078 --> 04:39.911
This special Hearts
and Hooves Day meetin'

04:40.013 --> 04:43.182
of the Cutie Mark Crusaders
is now in session!

04:43.484 --> 04:46.818
First order of business: helpin'
my big brother decorate the barn

04:46.920 --> 04:49.488
for his big date with
Sugar Belle tonight and--

04:50.394 --> 04:51.977
Hello?

04:53.578 --> 04:57.061
It seems like everypony's
got somepony special but us!

04:57.464 --> 04:59.631
When's it going to be our turn?

04:59.733 --> 05:00.765
[knock at door]
Huh?

05:03.070 --> 05:03.769
Huh?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.104
[gasp] Who's it from?

05:06.506 --> 05:07.524
Can't tell.

05:07.725 --> 05:12.243
It's all smudged, but it looks
like it's addressed to "Belle".

05:12.445 --> 05:15.514
Hmmm... SWEETIE BELLE!

05:19.853 --> 05:23.622
Somepony certainly went through
a lot of trouble.. for me

05:23.724 --> 05:25.157
on Hearts and Hooves Day!

05:25.259 --> 05:30.295
[gasp] You don't think...? Could
it be...? Hang on a minute.

05:30.597 --> 05:35.567
Mysterious package, smudged
address, no idea who it's from?

05:36.269 --> 05:37.669
I know what this is.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.539
YOU'VE GOT A SECRET ADMIRER!

05:48.949 --> 05:52.250
Spike: Ah! Another
Hearts and Hooves Day.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.152
Love is in the air, Discord.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.887
Look at all these happy couples.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.023
How can they be happy if
they aren't playing

05:58.125 --> 05:59.891
Ogres and Oubliettes?

05:59.993 --> 06:02.928
As a great Dragon poet once
wrote to his beloved:

06:03.030 --> 06:05.831
"I love you with
the utmost clarity;

06:06.133 --> 06:09.334
I love you, dear, my
sweet, sweet Rari--"

06:09.536 --> 06:10.902
Are you even listening?

06:11.304 --> 06:12.538
Of course.

06:12.639 --> 06:15.973
"Love is something-something,
and Discord is great."

06:16.076 --> 06:17.175
I don't know.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.044
Can we play O & O now?

06:19.246 --> 06:22.113
Sure, after you admit you
believe in love and--

06:22.215 --> 06:23.248
SUGAR BELLE!

06:26.653 --> 06:27.886
Big Mac's girlfriend.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.989
What's she doing
in town so early?

06:30.791 --> 06:34.993
Well, Sugar Belle, I'm sure
Big Mac won't be expecting it.

06:36.113 --> 06:39.130
She's planning her own
romantic surprise for Big Mac?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.599
What if she goes to
Sweet Apple Acres

06:40.700 --> 06:42.567
before Big Mac's ready
with his surprise?

06:42.669 --> 06:43.902
We've got to warn him!

06:47.674 --> 06:48.840
Whoa! [clang]

06:49.542 --> 06:50.208
Whoa!

06:50.410 --> 06:54.413
Mig Back! Mig Back!

06:55.815 --> 06:57.315
I mean Big Mac!

06:57.417 --> 06:58.650
We just saw Sugar Belle.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.252
She's at Sugarcube Corner,

07:00.353 --> 07:02.553
but I think she's on
her way over here now!

07:02.756 --> 07:05.123
You gotta keep her away from
here until the barn's finished!

07:05.259 --> 07:06.291
[gasp] Eyup!

07:08.829 --> 07:10.595
I wonder what she
has planned for him.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.565
[chuckle] We don't
have to wonder.

07:15.702 --> 07:16.568
Agh!

07:17.771 --> 07:20.005
Will you WARN me next
time you do that?

07:29.516 --> 07:31.750
Oh, she hasn't seen him yet.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.184
Take note, Discord.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.587
This is what love is all about!

07:37.458 --> 07:41.259
Spike, "Love is about
spying in the bushes."

07:41.361 --> 07:42.861
Make fun of me
all you want,

07:43.063 --> 07:44.395
but look at
Big Mac's face

07:44.497 --> 07:46.231
and tell me you don't
believe in love.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.171
I hope he'll be
OK without me.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.010
Oh, hey.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.045
We're just...

08:00.347 --> 08:01.279
not spying.
Hush!

08:04.818 --> 08:07.452
I mean, he has been
on his own before,

08:07.754 --> 08:09.421
so he'll be fine, right?

08:11.641 --> 08:13.558
How should I tell
Big Mac tonight?

08:13.660 --> 08:16.861
"You won't need to come visit
me in my village anymore"?

08:18.198 --> 08:19.664
"We need to talk."

08:20.066 --> 08:21.966
Just be honest
with him.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.735
You're right, OK.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.036
"We're finished."

08:31.178 --> 08:33.578
You're right. She
DID surprise him.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.713
Agh!

08:44.091 --> 08:46.658
OK. Things seem bad;
maybe they're really not.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.127
Maybe "we're finished"
was about the day.

08:49.329 --> 08:52.395
Ponies say that, right?
Like, "Hey, remember yesterday?

08:52.432 --> 08:54.399
That's finished.
Cause it's today."

08:55.802 --> 08:56.868
Maybe not that.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.971
Oooh! I know. Maybe Sugar
Belle has a wacky cousin

09:00.073 --> 09:01.232
who's never been on his own

09:01.333 --> 09:02.792
and she has to leave him
in charge of her shop

09:02.893 --> 09:04.352
while she apprentices
with Mrs. Cake,

09:04.453 --> 09:07.212
who does that, like, two days
a week. No, no, three.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.648
That's why she won't need you
to come to her village anymore.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.184
Because she'll already be here!

09:13.586 --> 09:15.554
Nah. I don't even
buy that one.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.494
She takes pie
baking seriously.

09:23.596 --> 09:24.996
Why'd I even try?

09:25.298 --> 09:28.166
I bet she thought I
was making fun of her.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.972
Oh, I hate seeing you
like this, Big Mac,

09:34.074 --> 09:36.341
and over a
girl, no less.

09:36.443 --> 09:40.879
I'm calling an emergency Guys'
Night right now to cheer you up.

09:44.551 --> 09:47.418
Besides, we can't have
you ruining any more of my

09:47.520 --> 09:50.222
1000-year-old monogrammed
handkerchiefs.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.957
These are silk, you know.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.432
Class is now in session.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.867
Lesson one: Nothing
can break your heart

10:02.969 --> 10:05.136
if you only love yourself.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.039
You've got to show everypony
that you're too cool

10:08.141 --> 10:11.609
to be bothered with so-called
"love." Observe.

10:13.146 --> 10:17.616
This is how cool guys
lean against things.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.418
When you see a guy leaning
against a thing

10:20.520 --> 10:22.587
looking this cool, you think,

10:22.689 --> 10:26.891
"Wow, that guy doesn't
have a care in Equestria.

10:26.993 --> 10:30.429
Not a guy who leans
on things that cool!"

10:30.831 --> 10:32.698
I don't think leaning
is gonna help.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.599
Am I doing it right?

10:34.701 --> 10:35.133
WHOA!

10:35.235 --> 10:35.934
OOF!

10:39.472 --> 10:41.139
We're not like you, Discord.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.374
We can't put on a front
and pretend not to love.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.543
It's impossible.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.946
Lesson two: Plenty of
ponies in the pasture.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.215
Right, Big Mac?

10:49.316 --> 10:52.983
I know just the gal to make you
forget all about Sugar Belle!

10:53.286 --> 10:57.488
YOU SAID HER NAME!

10:57.590 --> 10:58.323
Oy vey.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.426
OK! We finished decoratin'
the barn for Big Mac,

11:02.529 --> 11:05.830
which means we got the rest
of the day to ourselves.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.399
There's a whole town of
possible admirers out there

11:08.501 --> 11:10.135
and only three of us.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.304
But together, we're gonna
get to the bottom of this.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.039
Ready? BREAK!

11:16.042 --> 11:17.575
Excuse me, Pipsqueak?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.177
Mind answerin' a few questions?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.045
No? Late for something?

11:21.247 --> 11:23.348
Are you Sweetie-Belle's
secret admirer!?

11:23.550 --> 11:26.617
Excuse me, I'm doing a research
survey about sending pie

11:26.719 --> 11:27.886
in the mail anonymously.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.454
Would you say you're pro
"that," or anti "that?"

11:30.957 --> 11:32.457
Happy Hearts and Hooves Day.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.426
Did you boys happen to send
any packages to me recently?

11:35.728 --> 11:38.897
It's OK to say no;
I won't be offended.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.132
Please say no, please
say no, please say no.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.739
Sir McBiggun, meet Skellinore.

11:47.841 --> 11:51.709
She's a level-18 Bone-Warrior
in Squizard's Mage Army,

11:51.811 --> 11:54.579
but only to pay off
Skeleton Student Loan Debts.

11:54.681 --> 11:57.015
Get to know each
other, why don't you?

11:57.317 --> 12:00.585
Wow! You're really going
all-out to cheer up Big Mac;

12:00.687 --> 12:01.786
I'm impressed.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.588
Yes, yes, I'm amazing.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.756
Anyway, since we're
in the neighborhood,

12:05.858 --> 12:08.459
care for a quick game
of Ogres and Oubliettes?

12:08.561 --> 12:11.930
Like I've been wanting
to PLAY ALL WEEK?

12:12.332 --> 12:13.449
I take it back.

12:13.550 --> 12:16.067
I'm helping our friend,
first and foremost.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.869
See for yourself.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.711
I think he's showing her
a picture of Sugar Belle.

12:26.813 --> 12:27.529
What?

12:27.630 --> 12:28.846
And now he's crying.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.215
No no no no no no!

12:30.517 --> 12:31.950
No, he's not. Let me see that.

12:32.052 --> 12:32.817
Don't touch it.

12:32.919 --> 12:33.652
I'm looking!

12:33.754 --> 12:34.953
Give me-
Cut it out, Discord!

12:35.055 --> 12:35.854
Quit it!

12:37.299 --> 12:38.441
-used to do this thing

12:38.542 --> 12:40.184
where her nose would
wrinkle when she laughed.

12:40.285 --> 12:43.827
Right there in that hole
where your nose used to be.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.533
I never told her how much I
loved Wrinkle Nose Cutie Face.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.168
AND NOW I NEVER WILL!

12:52.004 --> 12:52.872
Agh.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.578
OK. I think we've had enough of
the aloof Master of Chaos'

13:00.680 --> 13:02.247
remedies for a broken heart.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.784
You know what I do when I have
a problem too big to solve?

13:06.886 --> 13:07.870
I hide from it.

13:08.071 --> 13:11.055
When she can't find you, she'll
realize how much she misses you!

13:11.157 --> 13:15.160
Plus, if she can't find you,
she can't break up with you!

13:15.762 --> 13:16.628
Eyup!

13:23.102 --> 13:24.035
I don't get it.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.438
We asked every
stallion in Ponyville.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.507
Ugh. There's got to be
somepony we're missin'.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.110
Somepony obvious.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.712
Somepony RIGHT in
front of our NOSES!

13:35.114 --> 13:36.065
Oh, well.

13:36.166 --> 13:38.917
At least the barn's looking
great for Big Mac's date.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.557
Too bad there won't be a date.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.693
Sugar Belle is so lucky to
have a "non-secret admirer"

13:48.795 --> 13:49.962
like Big Mac.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.130
Well, she certainly doesn't
seem to have appreciated it.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.034
Apple Bloom: I bet she's gonna take one look
at this barn and say

13:56.236 --> 13:58.469
"What did I ever do
to deserve this?"

13:58.671 --> 14:01.639
Yes, what did she
do to deserve this?

14:02.041 --> 14:04.308
She broke my heart.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.177
Well, not yet.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.564
Technically.

14:07.865 --> 14:12.050
In fact, she can't break your
heart if you break hers first.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.552
Eeeyup!

14:14.354 --> 14:16.821
Sugar Belle: Thanks for the
tour of Ponyville, Mrs. Cake.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.957
Oh, my pleasure.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.559
I'm off to surprise
Big Mac with the news!

14:21.761 --> 14:24.362
Imagine the look on his
face when I tell him:

14:24.564 --> 14:25.830
"We need to talk."

14:26.232 --> 14:27.865
Oh, dear me, no!

14:27.967 --> 14:29.967
I told you, don't
say it that way

14:30.069 --> 14:31.836
or he'll think you're
breaking up with him!

14:31.938 --> 14:33.271
Break up with him?

14:33.373 --> 14:34.239
Never!

14:34.340 --> 14:36.606
Why, without my
favorite delivery pony,

14:36.709 --> 14:39.110
I couldn't imagine
being happy ever again.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.478
He knows that.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.947
Good. Save your mix-ups
for cake batter;

14:43.049 --> 14:44.382
that's what I always say.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.417
Ha ha ha!

14:45.518 --> 14:47.251
He's a good
listener, that pony.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.620
I promise you: no mix-ups.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.256
Ah! Big Mac!

14:52.558 --> 14:53.858
Sugar Belle?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.426
We need to talk.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.700
I know why
you're here.

15:02.802 --> 15:03.685
You do?

15:03.786 --> 15:06.069
But I have something
to tell YOU first.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.438
Oh, can I go first?

15:07.540 --> 15:08.573
I'm going to be--          Stop.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.875
Oh. Why don't we tell
each other on three?

15:10.977 --> 15:11.409
One...

15:11.510 --> 15:12.742
It's over.

15:13.045 --> 15:13.911
What's over?

15:14.013 --> 15:16.247
You. And me.
It's over.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.848
Uh... what?

15:17.950 --> 15:19.250
We're breaking up.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.786
I.. don't understand.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.454
Why are you breaking
up with me?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.223
And why are you
leaning like that?

15:26.025 --> 15:28.026
I.... don't know!

15:28.228 --> 15:30.995
Big Mac, please talk to me.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.864
I-- you-- ARGH!

15:33.966 --> 15:35.800
This is why I
don't like talking!

15:35.902 --> 15:36.867
Words can hurt!

15:36.969 --> 15:37.969
Words HURT!

15:38.071 --> 15:39.904
GOODBYE, SUGAR BELLE!

16:08.434 --> 16:09.267
Big Mac!

16:09.769 --> 16:11.102
Oh, thank goodness.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.703
You gotta help us with this!

16:12.851 --> 16:14.851
[rustling] Huh.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.743
Dude, how long have
you been not-hiding?

16:19.779 --> 16:22.012
Oh. I should probably
have said something.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.314
Y'all should go.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.150
Did you... did
she... are you...?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.354
Big Mac? What's going on?

16:29.456 --> 16:30.756
Where's Sugar Belle?

16:32.158 --> 16:33.458
Just go.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.394
But we worked so
hard on this chart.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.563
I think we've almost cracked
it, if you could just--

16:38.665 --> 16:39.865
--not right now...

16:40.166 --> 16:42.166
But I can't stand having
a secret admirer

16:42.268 --> 16:44.435
who's too scared to
tell me who he is!

16:44.737 --> 16:46.871
Maybe he doesn't like TALKING.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.806
But that doesn't make any sense!

16:48.908 --> 16:50.474
Maybe he used to
talk too much

16:50.576 --> 16:52.276
and it only ever got
him into trouble!

16:56.382 --> 16:58.783
[sigh] What if you're
right, Discord?

16:58.985 --> 17:01.185
What if love isn't real at all?

17:07.527 --> 17:08.710
I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle.

17:08.811 --> 17:11.094
I'm just mad and I'm
takin' it out on you.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.014
That's OK.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.932
I bet if felt good to
get it out, though.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.000
Actually, it did.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.869
Tellin' you how
I felt just then.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.737
I gotta go!

17:20.039 --> 17:20.650
Big Mac!

17:20.751 --> 17:21.362
Where are you going?

17:21.463 --> 17:23.274
I gotta talk to Sugar Belle!

17:23.676 --> 17:25.476
Discord, you've got to
use your magic and...

17:27.347 --> 17:29.280
Guess you have
better things to do.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.549
Big Mac's gonna need a miracle.

17:40.843 --> 17:42.893
Of.... all the rotten luck.

17:53.639 --> 17:55.139
Caught you just in time.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.576
We both know I don't
like to say much,

17:58.678 --> 18:00.246
but I'm going to
say something now.

18:01.223 --> 18:02.023
Hmph.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.182
Even though I'm hurting,

18:04.484 --> 18:06.651
I wouldn't trade this
feeling for anything,

18:06.853 --> 18:09.687
because it'd mean giving up
the good times we had, too.

18:10.189 --> 18:11.923
I only broke up
with you because

18:12.325 --> 18:14.058
you were going to
break up with me.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.927
I respect your decision,
but you should know

18:17.129 --> 18:19.197
you'll always be
in my heart.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.700
I didn't want to
break up with you.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.369
But.. you said you don't
need me to visit anymore.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.038
You said I'm gonna
be on my own.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.774
I-I-I heard you said
"We're finished!"

18:29.876 --> 18:31.475
when I was hiding
in the bushes.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.245
That sounds worse
than it is.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.746
Oh, Big Mac...

18:35.848 --> 18:37.515
I was talking
about my cousin!

18:37.717 --> 18:40.451
I have this wacky cousin
who's never been on his own,

18:40.553 --> 18:43.187
but I have to let him
run my shop on weekends.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.356
Which is why you
won't be delivering

18:45.458 --> 18:46.975
to my village anymore.

18:47.176 --> 18:49.693
Because I'll already be here
apprenticing with Mrs. Cake,

18:49.996 --> 18:51.662
who does that two
days a week.

18:51.964 --> 18:52.997
No, three.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.433
Wait'll I tell Spike!

18:55.535 --> 18:57.835
I'd never break up with you.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.344
I suppose there's a lesson here
somewhere about communication.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.847
Talking instead of assuming,
or eavesdropping is wrong,

19:10.049 --> 19:11.049
wouldn't you say?

19:11.351 --> 19:12.683
Eyyyyyyup.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.322
[chuckle] Wrinkle nose cutie face.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.890
You must have been awful
confused at my breaking up

19:19.992 --> 19:21.826
with you after
you got my pie.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.161
What pie?

19:23.363 --> 19:24.862
You didn't get
the pie I sent?

19:24.964 --> 19:25.647
Mm mm.

19:25.748 --> 19:26.731
Or the invitation?

19:26.833 --> 19:27.633
Uh uh.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.534
Well, in that case...

19:30.536 --> 19:34.839
Allow me to escort you to a
Hearts and Hooves Day surprise!

19:42.682 --> 19:44.082
Mind if we join ya?

19:52.825 --> 19:55.626
"Happy Hearts and
Hooves Day, Sugar Belle.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.196
Meet me--" SUGAR Belle!?

19:58.598 --> 20:01.199
You have GOT to be
pullin' our hooves.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.101
It was all a mix-up?

20:05.038 --> 20:08.406
Aw it's funny; I've been sitting
here feeling sorry for myself

20:08.508 --> 20:11.375
for not having a special pony
on Hearts and Hooves Day,

20:11.677 --> 20:14.178
but remembering all
the fun we had,

20:14.480 --> 20:16.847
I think I have two
special ponies.

20:17.249 --> 20:19.417
My two best friends.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.684
Awww.

20:24.273 --> 20:27.190
And so ends another
Hearts and Hooves Day.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.626
Despite a bumpy start...

20:28.828 --> 20:30.428
and middle... and ending.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.496
A lot of bumps today.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.698
Love was in the air.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.733
So was confusion,
apparently.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.436
And a fair number
of assumptions.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.255
But YOU have to admit,

20:40.356 --> 20:42.273
after seeing everything
Big Mac went through,

20:42.375 --> 20:44.241
love is one hundred
percent real.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.111
Seriously?

20:47.313 --> 20:48.679
Discord! Come on.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.048
I can't believe you!

20:50.249 --> 20:53.016
Who do you think broke
Sugar Belle's wagon wheel?

20:55.955 --> 20:57.154
<i> ♪ Ta-da. ♪</i>

20:57.256 --> 20:59.691
Happy Hearts and Hooves Day.

21:00.493 --> 21:05.062
You old softie! Ha ha! I
knew you had a heart!

21:05.364 --> 21:06.797
Speaking of how great I am,

21:06.899 --> 21:08.899
are you busy for the
rest of the night?

21:09.752 --> 21:11.502
Calico's Ring of
Imperceptibility

21:11.604 --> 21:14.238
isn't going to reclaim
itself, you know.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.706
Ogres and
Oubliettes?

21:15.908 --> 21:17.608
I thought you'd
never ask.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.379
Oh, and just
wondering, no biggie,

21:21.481 --> 21:23.681
but is Skellinore
going to be there?

21:24.183 --> 21:26.650
Spike, she's an imaginary
one-dimensional

21:26.752 --> 21:28.386
paper cut-out skeleton.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.621
Well, nopony's perfect.
