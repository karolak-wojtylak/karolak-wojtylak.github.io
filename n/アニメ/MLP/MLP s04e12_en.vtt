11:51.586 --> 11:53.061
I challenge you...

11:53.572 --> 11:54.833
to a GOOF-OFF!

11:56.532 --> 11:57.258
Oh no!

11:57.658 --> 11:59.012
Not a Goof-Off!

11:59.814 --> 12:01.088
What's a Goof-Off?

12:01.387 --> 12:02.364
I have no idea.

12:03.373 --> 12:07.363
This Cheese has stood alone
a long time, Pinkie Pie.

12:08.302 --> 12:10.704
You think you
can out-goof me?

12:11.207 --> 12:12.458
Oh, I don't think so.

12:12.792 --> 12:14.333
I KNOW SO!

12:14.645 --> 12:17.057
And the stakes are
high, Cheese Sandwich.

12:17.338 --> 12:20.813
Whoever wins will be dubbed the
ultimate Super Duper Party Pony

12:21.018 --> 12:24.320
and headline the Rainbow
Dash Birth-Aversary Bash!

12:24.622 --> 12:25.467
And the loser?

12:25.951 --> 12:26.735
DOESN'T!

12:29.047 --> 12:31.418
So, are you in, Cheese?

12:31.711 --> 12:33.779
Or are you boneless?

12:34.290 --> 12:36.675
Nopony calls me boneless!

12:37.213 --> 12:38.044
Right Boneless?

12:39.654 --> 12:42.593
Then the Goof-Off
is on for High Noon!

12:43.114 --> 12:45.600
Um, Pinkie? It's already 3:00.

12:46.066 --> 12:50.657
Oh, well then. Make
it 3:10 to Goof-Off!

13:10.517 --> 13:11.652
All right, everypony!

13:12.097 --> 13:14.372
According to my official
Goof-Off Rule Book...

13:14.589 --> 13:17.221
She actually has a
Goof-Off Rule Book?

13:17.642 --> 13:18.846
Are you kidding?

13:19.061 --> 13:21.607
Twilight can find a rule
book for everything.

13:21.750 --> 13:22.386
Shhh.

13:23.582 --> 13:25.843
The two competitors have
free range to Goof About,

13:26.105 --> 13:28.667
be it by singing, dancing,
playing, prancing, joking,

13:28.671 --> 13:31.436
or performing to make the
Judge chortle, chuckle, giggle,

13:31.443 --> 13:34.128
guffaw, hoot and holler,
whoop it up, and party down!

13:35.496 --> 13:38.671
The funnier, sillier, wilder,
and goofier, the better.

13:38.958 --> 13:41.828
Rainbow Dash, since the winner
will be headlining your party,

13:42.152 --> 13:43.426
you are the Judge.

13:43.982 --> 13:47.744
Henh. Big, tense competition
on my birth-aversary.

13:48.277 --> 13:49.539
What could be better?

13:51.514 --> 13:54.774
Cheese Sandwich? Pinkie
Pie? Are you ready?

13:55.332 --> 13:57.055
I was born ready!

13:57.752 --> 14:00.052
I was ready before I was born!

14:00.684 --> 14:04.156

16:11.475 --> 16:15.155
STOP! The Goof-Off is off!

16:18.483 --> 16:20.480
But I haven't named a winner.

16:20.880 --> 16:21.923
You don't have to.

16:22.386 --> 16:23.752
I forfeit.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.607
Which means, Cheese
Sandwich wins!

16:27.850 --> 16:31.287
Ha ha ha! ... I do?

16:31.790 --> 16:35.301
Yes, you get to headline

you, Pinkie?

terrific headliner.

17:13.455 --> 17:15.644
I should have been a big
enough pony to admit that

17:15.793 --> 17:17.242
and let you have your day.

17:17.726 --> 17:19.338
But don't you get it?

17:19.840 --> 17:21.959
You're both Super
