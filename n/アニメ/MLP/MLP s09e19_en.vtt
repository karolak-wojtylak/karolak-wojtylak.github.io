Oh, Spii-iike? Are you in here?

00:07.408 --> 00:12.011
Hellooooo? ...Spike?

00:12.113 --> 00:12.879
Mm-hmm.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.847
Oh! There you are!

00:14.949 --> 00:16.582
I was starting to
think you weren't here.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.017
I realize this
is last minute,

00:18.119 --> 00:20.820
but I've decided on a
quick trip to the Gem Cave!

00:21.422 --> 00:23.222
I am on an urgent
mission to find

00:23.324 --> 00:25.625
some facetted iridescence
for my new design

00:25.727 --> 00:28.127
and I can't think of anypony
I'd rather have along

00:28.229 --> 00:31.263
than my favorite basket
holder slash body guard.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.297
Spike.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.268
Spike!

00:37.471 --> 00:38.504
Spike?

00:40.107 --> 00:40.806
SPIKE!

00:41.609 --> 00:43.775
Wha? Oh. Hey, Rarity.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.178
Honestly, Spike.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.447
It's almost as if you
haven't been listening!

00:50.284 --> 00:52.851
Oh, uh... of course I was,

00:52.953 --> 00:54.887
but just to be sure,

00:55.089 --> 00:56.689
could you say it all again?

00:57.191 --> 01:00.893
[sigh] I was saying that I planned
on visiting the Gem Cave and--

01:00.995 --> 01:01.927
Spike: Oh, no!

01:02.329 --> 01:03.429
Is that the time!?

01:04.031 --> 01:04.630
Ah!

01:04.732 --> 01:06.999
<i> ♪ [bustling music] ♪</i>

01:07.101 --> 01:07.950
Of course,
you're right.

01:08.051 --> 01:09.300
This is a bit of
a late start

01:09.403 --> 01:10.936
and those gems won't
pick themselves!

01:11.038 --> 01:11.703
Uh-huh.

01:13.441 --> 01:16.175
But the real question is.. which
basket do you want to hold!

01:17.177 --> 01:19.211
The smaller one, right?
Ah ha ha ha.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.748
Oh, right. Sorry Rarity, can
I take a rain check on...?

01:23.350 --> 01:24.316
What was that again?

01:26.053 --> 01:27.687
The... Gem Cave?

01:28.289 --> 01:29.421
Right. Sounds great,

01:29.723 --> 01:32.024
but I need to get to the
post office before noon!

01:32.326 --> 01:35.060
Ha ha! All right.
Very funny.

01:35.162 --> 01:38.363
Obviously, you'll get the
bigger basket and I sh-

01:40.534 --> 01:41.367
Spike?

01:43.404 --> 01:44.270
Hello?

02:23.878 --> 02:25.244
I don't understand.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.812
For as long as we've
known each other,

02:26.914 --> 02:29.682
Spike has never turned down an
opportunity to join me here.

02:29.884 --> 02:31.250
It's his favorite place!

02:34.255 --> 02:36.489
Ideally, you catch
the gems, dear.

02:36.791 --> 02:39.959
And for a trip to the post
office of all places!

02:45.499 --> 02:46.865
Maybe you should move closer?

02:47.667 --> 02:50.536
And why would Spike need to
go to the post office at all!?

02:50.638 --> 02:51.937
He sends mail by BREATHING!

02:52.039 --> 02:54.239
Breathing, darling!
Breath mail!

02:58.880 --> 03:01.246
Honestly, Applejack, if
you're going to fill in,

03:01.348 --> 03:03.248
you COULD make an ATTEMPT
to hold the basket

03:03.350 --> 03:04.716
the way Spike would!

03:05.619 --> 03:07.353
And how's <i>that</i>?

03:07.855 --> 03:10.889
Well, for one thing, Spike
knows how to keep things <i>quiet</i>

03:10.991 --> 03:12.724
so as not to waken the BATS!

03:15.429 --> 03:17.362
AND he usually
follows me closely,

03:17.464 --> 03:19.631
so no gem ever
touches the ground!

03:21.469 --> 03:24.236
Rarity, Spike's been
following you closely

03:24.338 --> 03:25.805
since he got
to Ponyville.

03:26.007 --> 03:27.539
And in case you
hadn't noticed...

03:27.741 --> 03:29.474
I AIN'T SPIKE!

03:34.181 --> 03:36.515
ACTUALLY, APPLEJACK,
I HAD NOTICED!

03:40.988 --> 03:43.422
Um... hi, Rarity.
What's up?

03:43.824 --> 03:44.891
Agh!

03:45.593 --> 03:49.596
Besides my mane? Well, that
is a question for Spike!

03:50.498 --> 03:53.899
Oh. Well, Spike isn't here. I
think he's at the post office.

03:55.836 --> 04:00.106
<i>Again</i>? What is it with
Spike and the post office?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.375
Rarity, what's
going on?

04:03.377 --> 04:06.111
Spike declined my
invitation to the Gem Cave

04:06.213 --> 04:08.280
and I intend to
find out why!

04:08.882 --> 04:11.216
Hmmm. That doesn't
sound like Spike.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.085
Did you two have
some sort of fight?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.587
A <i>fight</i>?
Goodness, Twilight!

04:15.689 --> 04:18.090
What in Equestria
would we fight about?

04:18.192 --> 04:20.225
I've had arguments
with friends before

04:20.327 --> 04:22.661
and they can put a real
strain on friendships.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.964
Well, certainly, but
I think I'd remember

04:26.066 --> 04:27.633
if we had an argument.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.535
Maybe you didn't
realize it?

04:29.837 --> 04:31.103
Do you think you could
have done something

04:31.205 --> 04:33.706
that unintentionally
hurt his feelings?

04:34.308 --> 04:36.041
Well, if I didn't
realize what I did,

04:36.143 --> 04:38.410
how would I know what I
have done when I did it?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.447
I wonder if that's it...

04:41.549 --> 04:45.617
It certainly would explain his
behavior. I must apologize!

04:45.819 --> 04:46.686

04:46.788 --> 04:51.023
Oh, pfft that's hardly the

to get a cutie mark because
Griffons don't get cutie marks

things, and after that,

13:35.983 --> 13:38.049
Oh, no apology
necessary, Spike.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.885
In fact, I was just
looking for you.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.287
You were? Why?

13:42.489 --> 13:45.390
Because I just
acquired.. these!

Passes to Power

went to the Crevasse,

scratched the surface

13:55.669 --> 13:58.136

gratitude for all you do.

13:59.773 --> 14:03.942
Ah.. Of course I wanna go, but
that'll be two days in a row

14:04.044 --> 14:05.244
we haven't hung out.

14:05.546 --> 14:11.250
Aha... are you kidding? It's Power
Ponypalooza. You have to go!

14:11.352 --> 14:14.553
And.. now you'll have two
things to tell me about!

14:15.255 --> 14:17.789

I know I told Gabby
we'd hang out tomorrow,

whole day to rest.

send her another note.

Heh. I think maybe
you're right.

14:52.793 --> 14:55.126

need to spend tomorrow

I hadn't counted on
Power Ponypalooza

No way! Ogres

15:20.454 --> 15:22.253
Well, I know how
much you enjoy it,

so, Spike.

I've just grown so used to
having Spikey-wikey around,

stops being yours.

have to share him!

Actually, more to confess.

And all of this stuff
isn't for Spike.

utter selfishness!

time with me as possible!

apologizing to Gabby

19:40.013 --> 19:41.880
so the two of you can renew
your friendship, Spike...

19:41.982 --> 19:43.882

you can't forgive me

forgive... SPIKE!?!

<i>you</i> an apology too...

19:53.093 --> 19:55.994
Oooh. I wish I didn't need to,

19:56.096 --> 19:58.096
but the more time you
two spent together,

19:58.198 --> 20:00.498
the more I missed
my time with Spike

20:00.600 --> 20:03.935

at my disposal to get it back.

You're kinda awesome!

20:19.052 --> 20:22.153
And.. I know what it's like
to miss that now too.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.590

could start hanging out again?

20:25.692 --> 20:27.025
Absolutely!

20:27.227 --> 20:28.726
I don't suppose you'd
like some company

20:28.828 --> 20:30.228

right now?

20:30.330 --> 20:31.596
I sure would!

20:31.698 --> 20:34.532
Wonderful! I can't tell
you how pleased I am

20:34.634 --> 20:35.800

20:37.837 --> 20:38.736
Heh.

I suppose Twilight is right.
Friendships do change.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.449
Of course, Spike and I

want to drop another one

21:00.493 --> 21:01.893
