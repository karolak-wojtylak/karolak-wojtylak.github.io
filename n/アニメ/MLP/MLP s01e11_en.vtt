00:09.395 --> 00:12.595
Spike! Wake up! Wake up, wake up,
it's Winter Wrap Up Day!

00:14.166 --> 00:16.555
-Mommy...?
-Winter Wrap Up!

00:17.199 --> 00:18.353
You're not mommy!

00:18.772 --> 00:21.584
Spike! The first day of spring is tomorrow!

00:21.684 --> 00:25.672
So everypony in Ponyville needs to clean up
winter. Now help me get ready.

00:26.855 --> 00:29.832
Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter?

00:29.910 --> 00:33.467
Don't they just use magic to change
the seasons like we do in Canterlot?

00:33.994 --> 00:37.020
No, Spike. Ponyville was
started by earth ponies...

00:37.131 --> 00:40.347
...so for hundreds of years they've
never used magic to clean up winter.

00:41.072 --> 00:42.203
It's traditional!

00:44.545 --> 00:46.196
It's ridiculous!

00:46.225 --> 00:48.071
No magic, pfuh...

00:51.331 --> 00:55.220
Okay, let's see. Scarf: Check.
Saddle: Check. Boots: Check.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.035
Spike refusing to get up and
going back to sleep: Check.

00:58.160 --> 01:02.434
It's a good thing I'm so organized.
I'm ready! Bright and early!

01:05.882 --> 01:08.287
Oh... Maybe a little too early.

01:47.603 --> 01:50.114
Those must be the team vests Rarity designed.

01:50.370 --> 01:51.650
Blue for the weather team...

01:51.747 --> 01:53.029
...green for the plant team...

01:53.042 --> 01:54.693
...and tan for the animal team.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.962
I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing.

01:57.100 --> 02:00.650
I'll take a blue vest.
The same color as my blanket.

02:01.041 --> 02:02.960
Which I think I hear calling my name.

02:03.412 --> 02:06.676
"Spike! Spike! Come to bed!"

02:07.193 --> 02:09.596
Ugh... It's too early.

02:10.908 --> 02:14.022
Thank you, everypony, for being
here bright and early.

02:14.112 --> 02:18.135
We need every single pony's help to
wrap up winter and bring in spring.

02:20.857 --> 02:24.142
Now, all of you have your vests and
have been assigned to your teams...

02:24.395 --> 02:29.596
...so let's do even better than last year and
have the quickest Winter Wrap Up ever!

02:32.429 --> 02:34.663
Oh, this is so exciting!

02:34.997 --> 02:37.440
All right, everypony, find your team leader...

02:38.366 --> 02:40.551
...and let's get galloping!

02:42.157 --> 02:44.099
Oh gosh! Where should I go?

02:44.366 --> 02:46.074
I'm not sure where I'd fit in.

02:48.792 --> 02:50.817
What exactly does everypony do?

02:51.338 --> 02:56.470
<i>Three months of winter coolness
and awesome holidays.</i>

02:56.641 --> 03:01.502
<i>We've kept our hoofsies warm at home,
time off from work to play.</i>

03:01.571 --> 03:06.561
<i>But the food we've stored is runnin' out
and we can't grow in this cold.</i>

03:06.569 --> 03:12.325
<i>And even though I love my boots,
this fashion's getting old.</i>

03:12.611 --> 03:16.904
<i>The time has come to welcome spring
and all things warm and green,</i>

03:16.978 --> 03:21.443
<i>But it's also time to say goodbye,
it's winter we must clean.</i>

03:21.520 --> 03:25.808
<i>How can I help? I'm new, you'll see.
What does everypony do?</i>

03:25.998 --> 03:31.549
<i>How do I fit in without magic?
I haven't got a clue.</i>

03:32.170 --> 03:36.229
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer!</i>

03:36.329 --> 03:40.597
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

03:40.695 --> 03:42.540
<i>Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

03:42.562 --> 03:46.469
<i>Bringing home the southern birds,
a pegasus job begins.</i>

03:46.491 --> 03:50.893
<i>And clearing all the gloomy skies
to let the sunshine in.</i>

03:50.971 --> 03:54.981
<i>We move the clouds
and we melt the white snow.</i>

03:55.081 --> 04:00.121
<i>When the sun comes up,
its warmth and beauty will glow!</i>

04:01.011 --> 04:05.208
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer!</i>

04:05.308 --> 04:09.396
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

04:09.397 --> 04:13.887
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

04:13.903 --> 04:15.614
<i>Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

04:15.721 --> 04:19.593
<i>Little critters hibernate
under the snow and ice.</i>

04:19.628 --> 04:24.005
<i>We wake up all their sleepy heads
so quietly and nice.</i>

04:24.087 --> 04:28.126
<i>We help them gather up their food,
fix their homes below.</i>

04:28.295 --> 04:33.507
<i>We welcome back the southern birds,
so their families can grow!</i>

04:33.982 --> 04:38.393
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer!</i>

04:38.573 --> 04:42.601
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

04:42.650 --> 04:46.841
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

04:46.842 --> 04:48.501
<i>Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

04:48.998 --> 04:53.213
<i>No easy task to clear the ground,
plant our tiny seeds.</i>

04:53.243 --> 04:57.062
<i>With proper care and sunshine,
everyone it feeds.</i>

04:57.195 --> 05:00.987
<i>Apples, carrots, celery stalks,
colorful flowers too.</i>

05:01.304 --> 05:05.414
<i>We must work so very hard.
It's just so much to do!</i>

05:05.614 --> 05:10.090
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer!</i>

05:10.091 --> 05:14.037
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

05:14.137 --> 05:18.316
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

05:18.416 --> 05:20.195
<i>Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

05:20.532 --> 05:25.536
<i>Now that I know what they all do,
I have to find my place.</i>

05:25.702 --> 05:30.224
<i>And help with all of my heart,
tough task ahead I face.</i>

05:30.324 --> 05:35.573
<i>How will I do without my magic,
help the earth pony way.</i>

05:35.574 --> 05:42.627
<i>I wanna belong so I must
do my best today! Do my best today!</i>

05:42.727 --> 05:46.663
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer!</i>

05:46.863 --> 05:50.816
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

05:50.817 --> 05:54.901
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

05:55.101 --> 06:03.249
<i>Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

06:08.815 --> 06:10.723
Everypony belongs to a team.

06:10.724 --> 06:13.420
What should I do? Where should I go?

06:14.199 --> 06:16.999
All right, team! You're cleared for takeoff!

06:18.120 --> 06:21.047
-Rainbow Dash!
-Oh, hey Twilight! What's up?

06:21.110 --> 06:22.443
What are you doing?

06:22.444 --> 06:26.071
Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve
the birds that have flown south for the winter.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.740
Oh! Can I help?

06:27.743 --> 06:29.595
How about if I help clear out the clouds?

06:29.971 --> 06:31.091
Um...

06:31.763 --> 06:33.452
Right. No wings.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.257
Sorry, Twilight.

06:38.037 --> 06:40.118
Great! Now what do we do?

06:40.653 --> 06:44.538
I don't know about you but I'm gonna be napping.

06:45.650 --> 06:48.593
Come on, Spike! This is serious business!

06:48.594 --> 06:52.372
Winter needs to be wrapped up.
And I'm determined to do my part!

06:53.407 --> 06:54.730
Somehow.

07:01.458 --> 07:05.655
Rarity, please tell me there's something...
anything I can help you with!

07:05.734 --> 07:10.247
Well, how would you like to help create
Ponyville's finest birds' nests?

07:10.659 --> 07:11.850
Birds' nests?

07:11.929 --> 07:15.632
Why, yes! When the weather team guides
the birds back north for the spring...

07:15.729 --> 07:18.199
...they'll need a place
to live and lay their eggs.

07:18.295 --> 07:21.346
Wow, Rarity, that one's really beautiful!

07:21.373 --> 07:25.514
Oh, why, thank you most sincerely.
Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?

07:25.579 --> 07:28.534
Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?

07:28.626 --> 07:34.340
Okay now. Uh... Take some of that straw and
hay over there and a little bit of branch.

07:35.804 --> 07:38.168
Now weave them through there... Yes!

07:38.273 --> 07:42.182
Uh... Take some ribbon, yes... oh uh n...
not there... oohhh... yes...

07:42.591 --> 07:45.057
Tuck it in over there. Uh...
but be careful not to...

07:45.502 --> 07:48.855
Oh no no, I... I guess that will do... Oh dear.

07:49.293 --> 07:50.413
There!

07:51.183 --> 07:55.020
It looks just like... yours. Oh my.

07:55.085 --> 07:56.964
That nest needs to be condemned!

07:56.965 --> 08:00.924
Oh, Spike. It's not so bad.

08:01.396 --> 08:03.221
Maybe the birds can use it as a...

08:03.222 --> 08:04.622
An outhouse?

08:04.645 --> 08:09.221
Spike. It's just fine. It's just a little
rough aroung the edges.

08:09.242 --> 08:10.703
Let me lend you a hoof.

08:10.813 --> 08:15.149
Let's just untie this ribbon and if we take
out these sticks here, we'll shape this...

08:17.307 --> 08:19.137
I think we lost her.

08:20.251 --> 08:21.661
...and we need to weave the string in here...

08:22.676 --> 08:25.262
Hellooo, Twilight!

08:26.427 --> 08:28.955
Wow, Pinkie Pie, you're quite a skater.

08:29.056 --> 08:31.356
Probably the best skater I've ever seen.

08:32.089 --> 08:36.706
Thanks, Twilight! I've been doing this since I
was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie!

08:36.833 --> 08:38.663
This comes naturally.

08:40.858 --> 08:43.795
Which is probably why they
designated me the lake scorer.

08:43.970 --> 08:45.746
I cut lines in the lake with my skates.

08:45.747 --> 08:48.461
That way, when the rest of the weather
team comes here to break the ice...

08:48.462 --> 08:50.561
...it will be easy as pie!

08:50.748 --> 08:55.020
How clever! When the thick ice begins
to melt, it will break along the lines.

08:55.226 --> 08:59.115
Well, you sure have a lot of work ahead of you.
There's quite a few lakes in Ponyville.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.690
Huh... Tell me about it!

09:00.775 --> 09:02.854
Hey, Twilight! Wanna help me out?

09:03.162 --> 09:04.488
Would I?

09:04.489 --> 09:08.266
Come on, put on those skates over there.
I bet you'll be a natural too!

09:08.371 --> 09:09.491
Okay.

09:13.529 --> 09:15.505
Maybe on second thought...

09:15.506 --> 09:18.414
What are you talking about?
You said you wanted to be helpful.

09:19.865 --> 09:20.985
Now get out there!

09:24.894 --> 09:27.042
Twilight! Steer! Steer!

09:28.660 --> 09:29.780
Oh boy!

09:40.521 --> 09:44.365
You ARE a natural, Twilight! Natural disaster!

09:45.837 --> 09:49.461
Twilight, you did a great
job your first time around.

09:49.462 --> 09:54.155
I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly
and bobbling and crasherrific as yours.

09:54.340 --> 09:55.569
Really?

09:56.267 --> 09:57.387
...No.

09:58.559 --> 10:00.058
But did I make you feel better?

10:00.927 --> 10:02.233
Yeah... I guess.

10:02.469 --> 10:05.847
I bet you'll be super awesome at something
that keeps your hooves on the ground.

10:06.140 --> 10:09.421
I know! Fluttershy could probably
use your help with the critters.

10:09.495 --> 10:11.786
Well, I'm pretty good with little animals.

10:11.787 --> 10:14.005
Yeah! I'll go help her!

10:15.036 --> 10:17.215
It's... that way.

10:23.655 --> 10:25.951
Wake up, little sleepy heads!

10:25.952 --> 10:29.787
Hope you had some wonderful
dreams and restful hibernation.

10:29.788 --> 10:33.243
But it's time to up now! Spring is coming!

10:37.055 --> 10:39.520
Awww, how cute!

10:39.579 --> 10:43.154
Aren't they? This is my
favorite task the whole season.

10:43.155 --> 10:46.135
When I get to see all my
little animal friends again.

10:46.564 --> 10:48.483
Uh... what's "hibernation"?

10:48.812 --> 10:51.295
It's like a long sleep.

10:51.660 --> 10:53.108
Long sleep?

10:53.338 --> 10:54.458
Yes.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.667
Wake up, little porcupines!

10:58.888 --> 11:03.166
Animals often hibernate through the winter
to save their energy and eat less food.

11:03.227 --> 11:08.040
I definitely like the idea of hibernation.
Uh... except for the "eat less food" part.

11:14.756 --> 11:18.012
Oh, but just look at all these warrens and dens.

11:18.013 --> 11:22.131
I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up
every animal before spring comes.

11:22.644 --> 11:24.967
Well, I'll help, Fluttershy!

11:25.118 --> 11:28.966
Oh, you will? Oh, that would be wonderful!

11:29.564 --> 11:30.684
Okay!

11:30.883 --> 11:32.713
Let's start there!

11:36.661 --> 11:39.351
Hello! Wake up, little friends!

11:39.352 --> 11:42.301
Wherever you are. Spring is coming!

11:43.653 --> 11:47.760
I wonder which cute little
furry creatures I've awoken!

11:50.264 --> 11:52.978
Aaa! Snakes! Snaaakes!

12:05.210 --> 12:07.325
Good morning, friends!

12:10.942 --> 12:14.405
All this Winter Wrap Up stuff
is a lot harder than it looks.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.860
Right. Because there's no magic.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.000
Why don't you just use magic,
Twilight, and get it done the right way?

12:20.034 --> 12:23.236
No, Spike. I have to do it the traditional way.

12:23.237 --> 12:26.027
Ponyville has never needed
magic to wrap up winter.

12:26.391 --> 12:28.795
But they never had you here before, either.

12:28.796 --> 12:31.626
Think of how much quicker they could
wrap up winter with your magic!

12:31.627 --> 12:37.377
No, no, NO! I'm gonna find some other
way that I can help out if it kills me!

12:39.516 --> 12:42.783
Keep pushin', Caramel! That's it, Bumpkin!

12:42.784 --> 12:46.766
I know it's hard work, but you
guys are doin' great! YEEHAW!

12:46.833 --> 12:49.164
Hey, Applejack! How's everything going?

12:49.165 --> 12:53.272
Oh, just dandy. A little slow startin'
but peachy all the same.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.319
There's a lotta groung to clear, ya hear?

12:55.320 --> 12:57.136
We can't ever start the
plantin' and the waterin'...

12:57.137 --> 12:59.460
...until we get all these heap
o' snow hightailed outta here.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.705
Well, I'd like to help.

13:02.896 --> 13:04.590
Well... I... I don't know, Twilight.

13:04.591 --> 13:06.243
Just give me a chance!

13:06.244 --> 13:08.726
Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but...

13:24.321 --> 13:27.240
"Think of how much quicker they could
wrap up winter with your magic!"

13:29.203 --> 13:31.658
I could use a come-to-life spell...

13:34.583 --> 13:35.986
Here goes.

13:50.852 --> 13:53.804
She's awful strong for such a little pony.

13:58.483 --> 14:00.894
That's my girl! Following my advice.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.279
And what in tarnation does that mean?

14:07.813 --> 14:10.356
Slow down! SLOW DOWN!

14:27.675 --> 14:28.678
What's goin' on?

14:28.679 --> 14:29.826
What'd you do?

14:29.827 --> 14:31.378
You used magic, didn't you?!

14:52.736 --> 14:55.516
Nuts, Twilight! You used magic!

14:55.517 --> 14:58.126
The nerve, can you believe her?

14:59.742 --> 15:02.224
That's not how we do it round here, Twilight.

15:02.225 --> 15:04.759
And especially not on my farm!

15:05.086 --> 15:08.222
Well, see... I just wanted to...

15:08.741 --> 15:09.861
Oh!

15:22.266 --> 15:24.731
Come on, Twilight. Come on out!

15:25.133 --> 15:27.224
I'm a winter mess up.

15:27.470 --> 15:29.210
Oh, you're good at a lot of things.

15:29.211 --> 15:33.844
Just not nest making, ice skating,
animal waking, snow clearing...

15:33.845 --> 15:38.080
Huh, thanks a lot for making
me feel sooo much better.

15:38.379 --> 15:40.307
That's what I'm here for, sister.

15:40.308 --> 15:43.769
Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team
need to melt the rest of this snow here...

15:43.770 --> 15:46.036
...on the ground and the trees pronto.

15:46.037 --> 15:46.919
Got it!

15:46.920 --> 15:51.893
You can't! My poor little animals' homes
will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.

15:51.894 --> 15:52.709
Got it.

15:52.710 --> 15:56.147
I'm tellin' you, Rainbow.
You gotta melt that snow now!

15:56.150 --> 15:58.690
No! You simply must wait!

15:58.878 --> 15:59.998
Okay...

16:00.080 --> 16:01.612
-Go.
-Stop.

16:01.613 --> 16:03.082
-Go!
-Stop!

16:03.083 --> 16:05.184
-GO!
-STOP!

16:05.185 --> 16:07.964
Urgh! Make up your minds!

16:08.040 --> 16:12.112
Oh! What in Equestria are
all you arguing about?

16:12.113 --> 16:15.354
This sort of sillyness is why we
were late for spring last year.

16:15.355 --> 16:18.129
And the year before that.
And the year before that!

16:18.130 --> 16:19.950
Did she say late?

16:20.158 --> 16:25.122
I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech
would urge everyone to do better than last year.

16:25.123 --> 16:28.327
But now it looks like we're
going to be later than ever!

16:28.328 --> 16:30.459
I mean just look at this catastrophe.

16:30.460 --> 16:33.381
The ice scorers made the ice
chunks too big to melt.

16:34.139 --> 16:36.339
The nest designer's horrendously behind.

16:36.340 --> 16:39.311
We need several hundred
and she's only made one.

16:40.775 --> 16:44.284
And don't get me started on all the clouds still
in the sky, the icicles on the trees...

16:44.285 --> 16:47.923
Oh, this isn't good. Not at all!

16:48.018 --> 16:52.076
And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous
if we can't get our seeds all planted.

16:52.077 --> 16:55.986
Chillax, Applejack. We're busting
our chops as fast as we can.

16:55.987 --> 17:00.503
No, not fast! You have to wake animals slowly.

17:00.697 --> 17:02.530
Uh, AJ?

17:02.531 --> 17:06.568
Oh, good gravy! Caramel lost the
grass seeds again, didn't he?

17:06.569 --> 17:08.258
Ey-yup.

17:09.023 --> 17:13.288
Ditzy-Doo accidentally went north
to get the southern birds!

17:13.289 --> 17:17.512
Oh, that featherbrain! Didn't she learn
her lesson last year, when she went west?

17:21.632 --> 17:25.034
Stop this at once! We don't have time to argue!

17:25.035 --> 17:28.612
It's almost sundown.
Spring is going to be late again.

17:28.613 --> 17:31.322
Another year of scandal and shame!

17:31.323 --> 17:34.398
If only we could be more organized...

17:34.724 --> 17:37.092
Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard.

17:37.093 --> 17:39.193
-Stat!
-Eh... Yes, m'am.

17:39.504 --> 17:41.324
Stop everypony!

17:42.926 --> 17:44.046
Stop!

17:48.635 --> 17:49.755
Sorry.

17:50.447 --> 17:52.950
I know you all want to
complete your jobs on time.

17:52.951 --> 17:56.569
But arguing is no way to go about it!
What you need is...

17:57.241 --> 17:59.080
Organization!

17:59.101 --> 18:01.327
And I'm just the pony for the job.

20:13.692 --> 20:18.289
I can't believe it. Spring is here! On time!

20:18.290 --> 20:20.416
And we have you to thank for it.

20:20.417 --> 20:24.051
If it weren't for your organizing
skills, we would still be arguing.

20:24.052 --> 20:25.172
Ey-yup.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.756
It was a team effort.

20:29.757 --> 20:33.848
And since you helped every team,
we have an official vest for you.

20:34.091 --> 20:38.176
We give you the title "All-Team Organizer"!

20:39.016 --> 20:41.415
Gosh... I don't even know what to say.

20:41.416 --> 20:43.078
Thank you, everypony!

20:43.328 --> 20:46.701
And hereby I declare that winter is...

20:46.702 --> 20:49.176
...wrapped up on time!

20:51.475 --> 20:56.256
Spike sure gonna be in for a hog-sized
surprise when that last piece a' ice melts.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.863
"Dear Princess Celestia."

21:02.864 --> 21:07.516
"Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special
things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville."

21:07.517 --> 21:12.466
"It helped me to learn that we all have hidden
talents and if we're patient and diligent..."

21:12.467 --> 21:14.188
"...we're sure to find them."

21:14.189 --> 21:18.852
"And as always, with good friendship and
teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything."

21:18.853 --> 21:20.342
How's that, Spike?

21:20.801 --> 21:21.921
Spike?

21:25.484 --> 21:26.884
Oh, Spike...

21:30.421 --> 21:33.921
