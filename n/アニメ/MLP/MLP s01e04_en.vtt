00:01.619 --> 00:04.893
Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me.

00:05.235 --> 00:08.878
That there's the biggest bumper crop
a' apples I've ever laid eyes on.

00:09.094 --> 00:13.990
Yep. Too big for you to handle on your own.

00:14.166 --> 00:17.393
Come on, big brother!
You need to rest up and get yourself better.

00:17.407 --> 00:20.067
I haven't met an apple orchard yet,
that I can't handle.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.089
Oops. Sorry.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.887
I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.

00:24.980 --> 00:28.623
Bitin' off more than you can chew
is just what I'm afraid of.

00:29.141 --> 00:32.709
Are you sayin' my mouth is makin'
promises my legs can't keep?

00:32.753 --> 00:33.572
Yep.

00:33.947 --> 00:37.828
Why of all the... This is your
sister Applejack, remember?

00:38.085 --> 00:41.212
The loyalest of friends and
the most dependable of ponies!

00:41.378 --> 00:48.447
But still only one pony. And one pony plus
hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to...

00:48.510 --> 00:51.524
Don't you use your fancy
mathematics to muddle the issue!

00:51.550 --> 00:55.053
I said I can handle this harvest
and I'm gonna prove it to you.

00:55.599 --> 01:01.356
I'm gonna get every last apple out of those
trees this Applebuck Season all by myself!

01:43.604 --> 01:48.366
Well, I better get kickin'. These apples
aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees.

01:50.512 --> 01:51.278
Hey!

01:51.550 --> 01:52.850
Oh no!

02:00.939 --> 02:03.070
STAMPEDE!

02:14.944 --> 02:20.892
Heeey...! Thiiis maaakes myyy
voooice sooound siiilly!

02:21.341 --> 02:24.186
Pinkie Pie! Are you crazy?! Run!

02:24.728 --> 02:28.182
Everypony calm down!
There is no need to panic!

02:28.254 --> 02:30.526
But Mayor! What ever shall we do?

02:30.711 --> 02:32.111
Look there!

02:34.178 --> 02:36.118
YEEHAW!

02:38.642 --> 02:39.762
Other side, Winona!

02:42.329 --> 02:43.430
Put 'em up, girl!

02:46.634 --> 02:48.915
This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen!

02:54.417 --> 02:56.705
Come on, little doggie! Herd!

02:58.310 --> 02:59.997
Winona! Put 'em up!

03:04.435 --> 03:05.236
Gotcha!

03:13.407 --> 03:14.347
Attagirl!

03:28.557 --> 03:30.657
Now what was that all about?

03:33.948 --> 03:36.791
Oh my! Begging your pardon, Applejack.

03:36.792 --> 03:41.574
But Mooriella here saw one of those nasty snakes.

03:43.394 --> 03:45.765
And it just gave us all
the willies, don't you know?

03:45.847 --> 03:51.437
I completely understand. Just next time,
try and steer clear o' Ponyville.

03:51.522 --> 03:55.657
We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!

04:03.855 --> 04:05.443
Ride 'em, cowpony!

04:05.576 --> 04:07.956
Applejack was just... just...

04:07.962 --> 04:09.569
Appletastic!

04:10.486 --> 04:15.475
Exactly! We must do something to thank
Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.

04:15.595 --> 04:16.805
I know!

04:17.351 --> 04:18.918
A party!

04:21.848 --> 04:24.208
-We all ready?
-Just one last thing.

04:30.108 --> 04:31.257
Now we're ready.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.628
-Is Applejack all set?
-Actually, I haven't seen her all week.

04:35.702 --> 04:37.080
Not since the stampede.

04:37.138 --> 04:40.945
But she'll be here for sure.
Applejack is never late!

04:51.320 --> 04:55.046
Welcome, everypony!
Today we are here to honor...

04:55.238 --> 04:59.543
...a pony we can always count on
to help in matters great and small.

05:00.629 --> 05:05.343
-A pony, whose contributions to...
-Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there?!

05:05.386 --> 05:07.047
What an athlete!

05:07.289 --> 05:09.759
This week she's gonna help
me with my new flying trick!

05:09.852 --> 05:12.470
And I know it's gonna be SO AWESOME!

05:12.537 --> 05:14.429
Exactly! And...

05:14.459 --> 05:17.969
This week, I get to run Sugarcube
Corner for the first time!

05:17.995 --> 05:20.235
What does that have to do with Applejack?

05:21.473 --> 05:25.571
Oh! Applejack, one of the best
bakers ever, is gonna help me!

05:25.669 --> 05:29.884
Applejack makes everything great.
So free samples for everypony!

05:31.773 --> 05:35.395
Okay, that's great. Now if I could just
make a point without being inter...

05:35.495 --> 05:37.081
-Twilight...
-...rupted.

05:37.299 --> 05:41.204
Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just
wanted to mention that Applejack...

05:41.304 --> 05:44.268
...is also helping me this week
with the official bunny census...

05:44.368 --> 05:47.530
...where we count up all the new baby
bunnies that were born this season.

05:47.565 --> 05:51.071
She's gonna help gather them
using her wonderful herding skills.

05:52.104 --> 05:55.021
Anyone else? Anyone?

05:56.237 --> 05:57.357
No?

05:58.623 --> 06:01.281
Well then, as I was trying to say...

06:03.408 --> 06:05.501
ARGH! Never mind!

06:07.626 --> 06:09.509
And so, with no further ado...

06:09.653 --> 06:14.592
...it is my privilege to give the prized Pony of
Ponyville award to our beloved guest of honor...

06:14.593 --> 06:18.932
...a pony of the utmost trustworthiness,
reliability and integrity...

06:19.111 --> 06:23.659
...Ponyville's most capable and
dependable friend: Applejack!

06:26.602 --> 06:29.003
...way to go, Applejack,
that was awesome! I mean...

06:37.226 --> 06:38.626
Awkward.

06:38.946 --> 06:41.215
I'm here! I'm here!

06:44.464 --> 06:46.841
Sorry, I'm late. Whoah... I was just...

06:47.400 --> 06:48.552
Did I hurt your tail...?

06:50.506 --> 06:55.193
Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for
this here... award thingy.

06:57.164 --> 06:59.528
It's so bright and shinin'.

07:01.351 --> 07:03.492
I sure do look funny here.

07:10.432 --> 07:15.942
Oookay. Well, thank you, Applejack, for
saving us from that scary stampede.

07:16.112 --> 07:18.391
And always being there for everypony.

07:19.818 --> 07:24.439
Yeah. I like helpin'
the ponyfolks and... and stuff...

07:28.634 --> 07:30.378
Yeah! Thanks!

07:42.289 --> 07:44.674
Was it just me or did Applejack seem a little...

07:44.768 --> 07:46.848
-Tired?
-Dizzy?
-Messy?

07:47.706 --> 07:50.023
Well, did you see her mane?

07:50.119 --> 07:51.939
She seemed fine to me!

08:12.869 --> 08:15.350
What on Earth is that pony doing?

08:16.132 --> 08:17.185
Whoops.

08:17.487 --> 08:18.572
Hey Applejack!

08:20.772 --> 08:24.487
Applejack! Applejack!

08:30.114 --> 08:31.320
APPLEJACK!

08:32.909 --> 08:35.637
-Howdy Twilight?
-What is all this?

08:36.055 --> 08:37.601
It's Applebuck Season.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.738
Apple-what Season?

08:44.132 --> 08:47.121
It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.249
We gather all the apples from
the trees, so we can sell 'em.

08:50.341 --> 08:52.457
But why are you doing it all alone?

08:52.542 --> 08:54.493
'Cos Big Macintosh hurt himself.

08:55.033 --> 08:58.533
What about all those relatives I've met when
I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?

08:59.722 --> 09:02.103
They were just here
for the Apple family reunion.

09:02.268 --> 09:06.422
They actually live all over Equestria and
are busy harvestin' their own orchards.

09:06.702 --> 09:08.574
So... I'm on my own.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.719
...which means, I should really get back to work.

09:14.963 --> 09:18.860
Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work?

09:18.865 --> 09:19.985
Fine.

09:20.609 --> 09:24.259
-Could you step aside, Twilight?
-I just did.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.969
Applejack. You don't look so good.

09:28.027 --> 09:32.068
Yeah... don't any o' you three worry
none, I'm just fine and dandy.

09:35.105 --> 09:37.177
Do you want some help?

09:37.272 --> 09:40.494
Help? No way, no how.

09:40.644 --> 09:42.805
But there's no way you can
do it all on your own.

09:42.905 --> 09:46.147
-Is that a challenge?
-Um... No?

09:46.380 --> 09:49.929
Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it!

09:50.108 --> 09:53.775
Now if you'll excuuuse me...
I've got apples to buck.

09:58.689 --> 09:59.897
There you are!

10:01.283 --> 10:02.893
I'm a might sorry, Rainbow.

10:03.075 --> 10:07.049
I was busy applebuckin' and I guess I...
I closed my eyes for a second and...

10:07.130 --> 10:11.139
...when I woke up, I was late.
Now, what's this new trick of yours?

10:11.152 --> 10:13.996
-See this contraption?
-Uh.. Yeah?

10:14.041 --> 10:18.568
Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then
you're gonna jump down from that platform...

10:18.745 --> 10:23.556
...launching me into the air faster than I could
take off on my own. Once I'm in the air...

10:23.733 --> 10:28.780
...I'm gonna do some AMAZING flips and spins
that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.

10:29.203 --> 10:31.110
Isn't that a mite dangerous?

10:31.800 --> 10:33.947
Not for a pony who can fly!

10:34.047 --> 10:35.424
Well, alrighty then!

10:43.224 --> 10:44.565
Oh my!

10:44.824 --> 10:48.090
Ready? One... two... THREE!

10:49.880 --> 10:55.348
Um... maybe I wasn't clear.
You're supposed to land *on* the other end.

10:56.892 --> 10:58.012
Got it!

11:01.754 --> 11:04.321
Applejack, what a hay is going on?

11:04.402 --> 11:07.902
I mean, I though I was working
with Ponyville's best athlete!

11:07.968 --> 11:09.348
You are!

11:09.740 --> 11:13.421
I'm okay! Really! I have an idea!

11:13.593 --> 11:14.713
Watch this!

11:17.779 --> 11:18.984
Ta-da!

11:20.064 --> 11:21.582
Oh... Maybe not.

11:21.909 --> 11:25.111
Okay, one more try!
I'm sure to get it this time.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.442
Here I go!

11:37.004 --> 11:41.251
Wait, Applejaaaaack...!

11:41.834 --> 11:43.632
You're welcome!

11:49.403 --> 11:50.638
Can I help you?

11:51.203 --> 11:55.444
I think somepony else needs your help.

11:55.630 --> 11:57.539
-Applejack?
-Yep.

12:06.677 --> 12:08.428
Applejack, can we talk?

12:11.198 --> 12:12.876
Applejack, can we talk?

12:14.036 --> 12:17.401
CAN BEES SQUAWK?! I DON'T THINK SO!

12:17.501 --> 12:19.176
No! Can we talk?

12:19.184 --> 12:22.417
TWENTY STALKS?! BEAN OR CELERY?!

12:22.451 --> 12:25.045
No! I need to talk to you!

12:25.091 --> 12:29.188
YOU NEED TO WALK TO THE ZOO?!
WELL, WHO'S STOPPIN' YOU?!

12:29.235 --> 12:31.060
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!

12:31.107 --> 12:35.579
OH! WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?!
WHAT'S YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT?!

12:35.671 --> 12:38.185
RAINBOW DASH DROPPED
IN TO SEE ME TODAY!

12:38.254 --> 12:40.567
THAT'S QUITE NEIGHBORLY OF HER!

12:40.610 --> 12:43.059
YES, EXCEPT THAT SHE
CRASHED ONTO MY BALCONY...

12:43.159 --> 12:45.037
...AFTER YOU LAUNCHED
HER INTO THE AIR!

12:45.429 --> 12:49.699
Oh, yeah. I wasn't feelin'
quite myself this morning.

12:49.707 --> 12:52.655
Because you're working too
hard and you need help!

12:52.773 --> 12:54.088
WHAT?! KELP?!

12:54.214 --> 12:56.927
I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed!

12:56.978 --> 12:59.165
HELP!!! YOU NEED HELP!!!

12:59.234 --> 13:05.700
Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you...
to everypony, that I can do this on my own!

13:06.250 --> 13:06.925
Ow!

13:07.953 --> 13:11.995
Now if you'll excuuuse me, I've
gotta go help Pinkie Pie!

13:15.539 --> 13:20.247
Now, Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking
the muffins and running the store this afternoon?

13:20.475 --> 13:22.448
Yes siree bob, Mrs. Cake!

13:22.742 --> 13:26.932
Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help
me out. Why, she's the best baker ever!

13:27.032 --> 13:29.344
Right, Applejack?

13:30.973 --> 13:33.251
No, you're not the best baker ever?

13:33.640 --> 13:35.167
What?! On, no!

13:35.563 --> 13:41.080
I mean... Don't you fret. I can bake anything
from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.379
All right. Well, see you later, girls!

13:45.734 --> 13:48.775
Stop with the shakin'! It's time to get bakin'!

13:49.782 --> 13:53.616
Alrighty! I'll get the sugar and the eggs.
Can you get me some chocolate chips?

13:55.036 --> 13:56.159
W... What was that?

13:56.531 --> 13:59.912
Chocolate chips!

13:59.977 --> 14:01.725
Chips... Got it!

14:01.798 --> 14:06.190
Tater chips. All salty and dry.
Okie dokie.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.446
What next?

14:08.630 --> 14:10.287
Baking soda!

14:10.720 --> 14:15.071
Soda... Perfect! That'll get
the tater chips nice and wet.

14:17.083 --> 14:18.244
Now what?

14:18.374 --> 14:19.504
A cup of flour!

14:20.260 --> 14:25.760
A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour.
A cup o' sour, comin' up.

14:27.387 --> 14:30.534
-Anything else, Pinkie?
-One last thing. Wheat germ!

14:31.289 --> 14:35.690
Wheat worms...? Oh! That must be
fancy talk for earthworms!

14:40.215 --> 14:42.478
Now that's gonna be delicious!

14:43.414 --> 14:44.807
If you say so...

14:46.947 --> 14:49.497
Free Muffin Sample Spectacular!

14:54.262 --> 14:58.174
Yeah! Muffin spectacles!
Get 'em while they're hot!

15:00.750 --> 15:02.310
We came as soon as we heard!

15:02.620 --> 15:05.977
Oh, thank you, Twilight.
We need all the help we can get.

15:09.808 --> 15:11.737
Oh no! What happened?

15:12.946 --> 15:15.207
It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.

15:15.678 --> 15:20.532
No... Not baked goods... Baked bads...!

15:22.011 --> 15:23.222
Applejack!

15:24.245 --> 15:25.431
Want one?

15:41.474 --> 15:43.484
Applejack? We need to talk.

15:44.870 --> 15:46.835
Oh. It's you, Twilight.

15:47.914 --> 15:51.642
I know what you're gonna say,
but the answer is still no.

15:51.724 --> 15:54.574
Not to upset your applecart, but you need help.

15:54.979 --> 15:58.791
Hardy har... No, I don't!

15:59.463 --> 16:03.024
-Here. Let me help.
-Help?! No thanks!

16:05.631 --> 16:08.591
A little more... Little...

16:10.198 --> 16:10.990
There.

16:12.486 --> 16:16.504
I'll prove that this apple
can handle these apples.

16:16.536 --> 16:21.021
Come on... apples... Fall off!

16:21.453 --> 16:23.926
AJ... I think you're beating a dead...

16:24.508 --> 16:25.628
...tree.

16:26.968 --> 16:28.368
I knew that.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.581
Actually, Applejack, I had something
else to talk to you about.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.648
I just came back from
Ponyville urgent care and...

16:33.748 --> 16:37.070
You know? I'm a little busy to
get lectured right now, Twilight.

16:37.073 --> 16:38.603
But if you'd just let me help...

16:39.223 --> 16:41.536
No no NO!

16:42.022 --> 16:47.517
How many times do I gotta say it?
I don't need no help from nopony!

16:48.881 --> 16:51.015
That pony is stubborn as a mule!

16:51.748 --> 16:54.442
-No offense...
-None taken.

16:57.279 --> 17:02.520
Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your
herding skills for the annual rabbit round up.

17:03.008 --> 17:04.468
Why are we doing this?

17:04.615 --> 17:07.482
Well, lots of new baby
bunnies have been born...

17:07.543 --> 17:10.209
...so it's my job to get a count
of all the new families.

17:10.309 --> 17:12.267
Fine. Can we just get on with it?

17:12.291 --> 17:16.434
Certainly. But remember, these are
bunnies we're dealing with, not cows.

17:16.580 --> 17:18.864
They are timid bunch and
need to be treated gently.

17:18.895 --> 17:23.822
I do NOT need any direction on
corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?

17:25.741 --> 17:30.689
Okay, little bunnies! I need you
all gather here in the middle.

17:31.099 --> 17:34.953
That's right! Let's go, bunnies.
In the center. Hop to it!

17:35.429 --> 17:37.337
Swell. Just swell.

17:39.941 --> 17:41.458
Put 'em up, Winona!

17:46.182 --> 17:50.345
Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them!

17:50.466 --> 17:53.426
We know what we're doin'.
Get along, little bunnies!

17:59.557 --> 18:00.886
Oh no.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.528
STAMPEDE!

18:36.994 --> 18:38.761
The horror...! The horror...!

18:38.961 --> 18:40.315
That was awful!

18:40.333 --> 18:43.192
A disaster! A horrible, horrible disaster!

18:45.178 --> 18:46.012
I don't get it.

18:46.535 --> 18:48.565
Our gardens! Destroyed!

18:48.621 --> 18:50.322
Every last flower devoured.

18:50.445 --> 18:53.131
By... By... THEM!!!

18:53.664 --> 18:55.717
Oh my! Oh... Please stop, little bunnies!

18:56.165 --> 19:00.037
No no! Please, let's go home! Oh my goodness!

19:00.184 --> 19:03.090
All right. Enough is enough.

19:04.772 --> 19:07.200
Must... keep... buckin'.

19:07.995 --> 19:12.600
Just... a few... more...
Must... finish harvestin'.

19:12.700 --> 19:16.340
All right, Applejack. Your applebucking
hasn't just caused you problems.

19:16.528 --> 19:19.614
It's over-propelled pegasus, practically
poisoned plenty of ponies...

19:19.711 --> 19:21.937
...and terrorized bushels of
brand new bouncing baby bunnies.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.977
I don't care what you say. You! Need! Help!

19:28.384 --> 19:30.923
No, I don't. Look! I did it!

19:31.736 --> 19:36.019
I harvested the entire Sweet
Apple Acres without your help.

19:36.928 --> 19:38.705
How d'ya like them apples?

19:39.011 --> 19:42.464
Um... How do *you* like *them* apples?

19:52.854 --> 19:55.746
...plejack? Applejack!

19:56.957 --> 19:58.499
Oh, good! You're okay.

19:59.117 --> 20:02.256
Now, Applejack, I completely
respect the Apple family ways.

20:02.670 --> 20:04.826
You're always there to help anypony in need.

20:05.008 --> 20:09.689
So maybe you can put a little of your stubborn
pride aside and allow your friends to help you?

20:10.544 --> 20:11.548
Okay, Twilight.

20:11.572 --> 20:14.082
I am not taking "no" for an answer... what?

20:14.511 --> 20:19.201
Yes, Twilight. Yes, please!
I could really use your help.

20:23.577 --> 20:25.167
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:25.234 --> 20:28.539
"My friend Applejack is the best
friend a pony could ever have."

20:28.702 --> 20:30.858
"And she's always there to help anypony."

20:31.133 --> 20:34.680
"The only trouble is, when she needs
help, she finds it hard to accept it."

20:35.064 --> 20:37.854
"So while friendship is about
giving of ourselves to friends..."

20:37.930 --> 20:40.486
"...it's also about accepting
what our friends have to offer."

20:40.850 --> 20:43.183
"Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

20:43.324 --> 20:45.053
How about y'all take a little break?

20:45.337 --> 20:47.573
I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya!

20:49.004 --> 20:51.526
Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help.

20:51.955 --> 20:54.920
-I was acting... a bit stubborn.
-A bit?

20:55.007 --> 20:57.113
Okay. A might stubborn!

20:57.706 --> 20:59.521
And I'm awful sorry.

20:59.859 --> 21:03.183
Now, I know the town gave
me the Prized Pony award...

21:03.666 --> 21:07.235
...but the real award is
havin' you five as my friends.

21:08.752 --> 21:12.570
Phew! That applebucking
sure made me hungry!

21:12.666 --> 21:14.574
And I've got the perfect treat!

21:14.664 --> 21:18.442
Eeeew... Spike, I threw them all away!
Where'd you get them?

21:18.565 --> 21:19.501
From the trash!

21:22.309 --> 21:25.380
Just a little nibble? Come on.

21:29.846 --> 21:33.346
