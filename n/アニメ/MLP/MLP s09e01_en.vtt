WEBVTT

00:08.676 --> 00:10.776
Oh, good, we're all here!

00:10.978 --> 00:13.245
So everypony got an urgent
summons to the castle

00:13.347 --> 00:14.714
with no explanation?

00:15.016 --> 00:18.818
Yup! I just love a good
mysterious summons.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.220
What's it about? Do you
think it's a surprise party?

00:21.622 --> 00:22.955
Hey, why are we running?

00:23.057 --> 00:24.924
Because something could
be terribly wrong!

00:25.026 --> 00:25.958
Somepony turned bad,

00:26.060 --> 00:28.194
another evil creature
back for revenge!?

00:28.396 --> 00:30.696
Don't you think you're
being a little paranoid?

00:30.898 --> 00:33.766
Why else would the princesses
send scrolls in such a hurry?

00:33.868 --> 00:36.402
Good point. They'd know
better than to make us worry.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.604
Plus, I like it when
you run so fast;

00:38.706 --> 00:39.939
the walls get all blurry!

00:41.142 --> 00:42.874
Wheee!
Race ya!

00:48.516 --> 00:50.983
Girls, thank you
so much for coming.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.685
What's wrong!? What can we do!?

00:52.987 --> 00:56.622
That's just it. Nothing's
wrong. Everything's perfect!

00:57.024 --> 01:00.660
Did y'all call us down
here just to tell us that?

01:00.862 --> 01:03.028
With all due
respect, Majesties,

01:03.130 --> 01:05.231
you might want to save
your urgent summons

01:05.333 --> 01:08.400
for matters that are a
bit more... well, urgent?

01:10.537 --> 01:12.171
Well, there is more to it.

01:12.373 --> 01:15.107
Equestria is currently
enjoying its longest period

01:15.209 --> 01:17.143
of harmony in recent years.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.679
And it's all thanks
to you, Twilight.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.713
And your
friends, of course.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.182
Who, us?

01:23.284 --> 01:24.617
Oh, pshaw! [giggle]

01:24.719 --> 01:26.418
It's about time
you noticed!

01:26.620 --> 01:27.487
Thank you!

01:27.989 --> 01:28.905
Because of your efforts,

01:29.006 --> 01:31.322
there's been less
and less for us to do!

01:31.425 --> 01:35.627
So, after much consideration,
my sister and I have decided

01:35.729 --> 01:38.831
it is time for us... to retire.

01:40.985 --> 01:44.002
Breaking News! The royal
princesses retiring?

01:44.105 --> 01:45.605
I have so many
questions.

01:45.707 --> 01:47.940
Who'll take over? Who
will run Equestria?

01:48.042 --> 01:49.942
Will it be someone
tall, dark, and handsome

01:50.044 --> 01:52.244
or will it be the
Lord of Chaos?

01:56.450 --> 01:59.351
Ugh. Fine, go with
the obvious choice.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.126
You're retiring!?

02:41.428 --> 02:43.395
Princesses can retire?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.832
Of course we can! I, for
one, am looking forward

02:46.934 --> 02:50.335
to a little R&R, maybe
a trip to Silver Shoals.

02:50.537 --> 02:53.005
And you want <i>me</i> to
take your place!?

02:53.507 --> 02:54.540
Mm hm!

02:54.642 --> 02:56.841
With the help of your
friends, of course.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.282
We can't think of
anypony more worthy.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.284
Over the years, we've
watched you grow.

03:06.386 --> 03:08.319
You've faced
task after task.

03:08.421 --> 03:09.821
...challenge
after challenge.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.992
...countless adversities. Yeah,
yeah, we get it.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.061
And you've always
prevailed.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.829
Thank you, but that
doesn't mean that I'm--

03:18.231 --> 03:20.632
that <i>we're</i> ready
to do what you do!

03:20.934 --> 03:24.569
Oh. Of course you are. I realize
this is a lot to take in, but--

03:24.671 --> 03:27.906
Nope! Makes perfect
sense. We're awesome.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.142
[gasp] Does this mean we
get all your powers!?

03:30.244 --> 03:33.045
Ooo-oo! I call dibs on showing
up in everypony's dreams!

03:33.447 --> 03:35.347
You can't be ready to step
into their horse shoes

03:35.449 --> 03:36.715
just like that!

03:36.817 --> 03:39.551
Well, if the Princesses
think it's time to retire,

03:39.753 --> 03:41.019
we're not a bad choice.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.622
We always have Equestria's
best interests at heart.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.056
That's a fair point,

03:45.158 --> 03:46.691
which should be taken
into consideration

03:46.793 --> 03:48.127
when we have a
roundtable discussion.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.596
Well, I'm in.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.564
Darlings! We'll all need a
complete wardrobe update.

03:52.766 --> 03:56.101
And I would love to pick your
brain about mane maintenance.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.237
When you have a moment.

03:57.438 --> 04:01.072
As long as we all have each
other, I'm sure we can do it.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.040
Yay!

04:02.142 --> 04:06.811
Protectors of Equestria
on three. One, two--

04:11.819 --> 04:14.420
If you're all on board,
I guess I am too.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.890
All: Protectors of Equestria!

04:18.592 --> 04:20.158
It'll be a bit of
an adjustment,

04:20.260 --> 04:21.693
but I imagine the
transfer of power

04:21.795 --> 04:23.094
will be a lengthy process
which will give me--

04:23.196 --> 04:24.863
Actually, we just
need a few days

04:24.965 --> 04:26.498
to put together a
little ceremony.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.034
Heh heh. A few DAYS!?

04:30.403 --> 04:31.903
But... that's so soon!

04:32.005 --> 04:33.772
Shouldn't there be some
sort of training program?

04:33.874 --> 04:36.541
That lasts weeks, no,
months, if not YEARS?

04:36.743 --> 04:38.676
Everything you've gone
through over the years

04:38.778 --> 04:40.579
has been a
training program.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.248
OK, but there's got to be
a guide or a rule book?

04:43.350 --> 04:44.649
Yes, I have it right here:

04:44.751 --> 04:48.119
"How to Rule Equestria"
by Nopony McPretendsmith.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.923
The Friendship Journal
you wrote yourselves

04:52.025 --> 04:54.459
is a better guide than
any we could provide.

04:56.529 --> 04:58.630
We have the utmost
confidence in you.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.433
And we hope you have
the same in yourself.

05:06.039 --> 05:10.176
Oh, I'm absolutely
certain she does.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.812
I am not confident
about this at all!

05:14.214 --> 05:18.249
Well, that's what I thought.
I was being sarcastic before.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.822
What? This is all
so predictable.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.725
Now's the part where you all
tell little Sparkle here

05:26.827 --> 05:28.360
that everything is
going to be fine.

05:28.462 --> 05:33.798
But she won't believe you.
[groan] I don't need to be here for this.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.702
It's just, I know I said
yes, but then they said

05:37.804 --> 05:40.205
"in a few days" and there's
still so much to figure out!

05:40.407 --> 05:42.006
It's all happening so fast!

05:43.710 --> 05:44.777
I think I need some--

05:47.047 --> 05:49.014
[gulp] OK. I'll feel
much better--

05:49.116 --> 05:51.050
Once you make
a plan?

05:52.152 --> 05:53.552
Oh. Wow. It's
like you--

05:53.654 --> 05:56.354
--knew you were going to
react this way? We did.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.356
Classic Twilighting.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.727
"Twilighting?" You...
you made me a verb?

06:02.129 --> 06:06.398
It's not a bad thing, we just
know you have a.... process.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.135
Stage one. You get big
news, and you're like "No!"

06:10.237 --> 06:13.104
But then you pace, and
you chart, you worry...

06:13.206 --> 06:15.273
It's OK. You go
ahead and "Twilight"

06:15.475 --> 06:17.042
and we'll be here for you.

06:17.744 --> 06:20.812
You're all acting so calm,
but this is a big deal!

06:20.914 --> 06:22.380
What will we do if
something big happens

06:22.482 --> 06:24.215
and the princesses
aren't there to help?

06:25.018 --> 06:26.885
Um... If you think about it,

06:26.987 --> 06:29.087
they literally
almost never help.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.156
Huh.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.458
And.. we still always win!

06:33.560 --> 06:35.527
Like when Sombra almost took
back the Crystal Empire,

06:35.629 --> 06:37.262
or when Chrysalis
pretended to be Cadance,

06:37.464 --> 06:39.464
or when Tirek came back and
absorbed all the magic,

06:39.666 --> 06:41.633
or the other time Chrysalis
tried to take over,

06:41.735 --> 06:45.270
or with Cozy Glow and the
school. [gasp] Am I missing anything?

06:45.472 --> 06:46.304
Pony of Shadows.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.639
Starlight when
she was evil.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.940
Discord when he was evil.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.475
Do Flim and
Flam count?

06:50.577 --> 06:52.944
See? We've almost
always done things

06:53.046 --> 06:54.412
without the princesses' help.

06:54.514 --> 06:57.148
Which makes sense now because
it was all just training

06:57.250 --> 06:58.550
for you to take over.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.552
And it worked. I mean,
if you think about it,

07:00.654 --> 07:02.187
there hasn't been
a single villain

07:02.289 --> 07:03.688
that we couldn't defeat.

07:03.790 --> 07:04.556
Phew.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.260
One day, you'll see.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.963
I will defeat Twilight
Sparkle and her friends,

07:12.465 --> 07:15.199
and they will pay for
stealing my kingdom!

07:23.577 --> 07:24.776
Pssst! Tirek!

07:25.078 --> 07:29.681
It is <i>Lord</i> Tirek
and what is it now?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.416
I just want to make
sure you can see my

07:31.518 --> 07:33.952
"best friends rock
sculpture" from over there.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.083
Lord Tirek.

08:05.285 --> 08:08.554
A changeling?
See? She gets it.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.456
Chrysalis, Queen
of the Changelings.

08:11.558 --> 08:15.126
Or at least I will be when I'm
restored to my rightful place.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.597
Why did you summon
me? What do you want?

08:18.799 --> 08:22.267
Wah! Oh, golly! We
didn't bring you.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.636
I thought you freed
us from Tartarus.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.438
Tartarus? Whoever
pulled you from there

08:27.540 --> 08:30.842
must have been somepony
very powerful, indeed.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.054
King Sombra! You
have returned?

08:43.256 --> 08:44.656
Why did you
bring us here?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.391
Deep voice: He didn't.

08:54.601 --> 08:55.834
It was I.

08:57.337 --> 09:01.673
You may call me... Grogar.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.309
<i>The</i> Grogar?

09:04.411 --> 09:06.277
I thought that you
were a legend.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.479
I've heard of you!

09:07.581 --> 09:08.314
Who..?

09:09.216 --> 09:12.484
I assure you, I
am very real.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.854
And you have all been brought
here as part of my plan

09:16.056 --> 09:21.359
to rid Equestria of Twilight
Sparkle and her friends

09:21.561 --> 09:24.095
once and for all!

09:24.197 --> 09:26.497
Heh heh heh heh.

09:30.470 --> 09:33.738
I am so sorry, but
the name Grofar

09:33.840 --> 09:35.106
just doesn't
ring any bells.

09:35.308 --> 09:38.977
GROGAR! I have
been away too long

09:39.079 --> 09:41.579
if my name no longer
strikes fear into the heart

09:41.681 --> 09:43.749
of one so tiny.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.686
Perhaps a demonstration
of power is in order?

10:01.568 --> 10:05.670
Grogar is ancient and
extremely powerful.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.006
The land that would
become Equestria

10:08.108 --> 10:10.775
was a mere collection
of farms and pastures

10:10.877 --> 10:15.314
until he declared himself
Emperor of all he saw.

10:15.516 --> 10:19.718
I remember hearing tales of
his tyranny when I was young.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.121
I have also heard of the
first Emperor of Equestria,

10:23.223 --> 10:25.524
the "Father of Monsters."

10:25.826 --> 10:29.361
I gave life to the
foulest of creatures

10:29.463 --> 10:32.964
and allowed them to run wild,
taking what they wanted

10:33.066 --> 10:35.366
and destroying the rest!

10:35.468 --> 10:39.070
My reign was a glorious
fear-soaked epoch

10:39.172 --> 10:42.007
of darkness in Equestria.

10:42.409 --> 10:46.711
Ha! Until Gusty the Great
rose up and banished you.

10:46.813 --> 10:50.315
That fool believed taking
my bell would defeat me,

10:50.417 --> 10:53.452
but she only weakened
me temporarily.

10:53.854 --> 10:58.390
Um, Tirek is <i>really</i> old. No
offense, you look great.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.358
But if he knew about
you when he was young,

11:00.560 --> 11:03.728
we have super-different ideas
about what "temporarily" means.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.966
Silence! I have spent
millennia gathering power,

11:08.068 --> 11:11.369
biding my time, waiting
for the perfect opportunity

11:11.471 --> 11:15.640
to seize control of Equestria!
And watching all of you.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.410
I've seen each of your
humiliating defeats

11:18.512 --> 11:21.847
at the hooves of
six puny ponies.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.517
And do you know why
they've always bested you?

11:25.919 --> 11:27.652
Because they cheat.

11:27.954 --> 11:31.790
Because they are
annoyingly lucky.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.359
I'm just a kid, so...

11:34.461 --> 11:37.562
It is because they
work together.

11:37.764 --> 11:42.200
Where one is weak, another
is strong and thus unified,

11:42.502 --> 11:44.603
they are a formidable force.

11:44.905 --> 11:48.707
But we shall use their own
strategy to defeat them.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.909
What are you suggesting?

11:51.411 --> 11:55.580
I suggest nothing. I
DEMAND that you join me

11:55.682 --> 11:59.284
and together Equestria
will be ours!

11:59.886 --> 12:04.055
I don't do "ours",
I only do MINE.

12:05.459 --> 12:08.693
I will take back the
Crystal Empire on my own

12:08.895 --> 12:12.564
and I will destroy anypony
who gets in my way!

12:13.166 --> 12:15.067
Such confidence.

12:15.669 --> 12:19.237
Go. Try to take
back your kingdom.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.473
I shall send you
there myself.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.042
If you prevail, you
may keep it.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.046
But when you fail,
you will submit to me.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.683
And if I refuse this... deal?

12:31.785 --> 12:33.818
Then I shall return
you to the darkness

12:33.920 --> 12:35.754
from which you
were summoned.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.056
Fine. But this is
a waste of time,

12:38.158 --> 12:40.825
as I will crush
those who defy me.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.962
I will defeat all who
get in my way. I--

12:45.016 --> 12:48.667
I advise the rest of you to
prepare to work together.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.704
Well, working together
sounds an awful lot like

12:52.806 --> 12:55.707
making friends, so
you two are in luck

12:55.809 --> 12:57.809
because I know all
about that!

13:01.515 --> 13:05.016
Twi? You in here? With the
school closed for the summer,

13:05.118 --> 13:07.085
I didn't think anypony
would be here.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.088
So much to do, not enough
time. No! I already did that.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.158
Wait. Nope. I didn't.
OOOH, NOT ENOUGH TIME!

13:13.260 --> 13:14.859
HELP! She's spiraling.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.028
We're at the "my plan
needs a plan" stage

13:17.130 --> 13:18.997
of a Total Twilight
Melt Down!

13:19.699 --> 13:21.166
Oh. Got it.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.101
Twilight?

13:23.403 --> 13:25.536
Did I write down "eliminate
redundant lists"

13:25.638 --> 13:27.238
on my School of
Friendship to-do list,

13:27.340 --> 13:28.740
or my personal to-do list?

13:29.442 --> 13:30.509
TWILIGHT!           Gah!

13:30.811 --> 13:33.278
Starlight! Oh, good, you're
here. I need to talk to you.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.879
Oh-kay...

13:34.981 --> 13:36.948
Hang on, I had "talk to
Starlight" written down

13:37.050 --> 13:39.484
on one of these. Just let me
find it so I can cross it off.

13:40.186 --> 13:43.221
Wow, you are
"Twilighting" hard.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.123
You say
Twilighting too!?

13:45.225 --> 13:47.659
Well, EXCUSE me, but
this is the first time

13:47.761 --> 13:50.061
I've ever been asked
to run A WHOLE KINGDOM!

13:50.463 --> 13:52.564
Ah! You're right. You're right... Heh.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.033
So.. what did you want
to talk to me about?

13:55.135 --> 13:56.935
Ah! Here it is. I
wrote it down.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.803
Starlight, you have blossomed
into one of the strongest,

13:58.905 --> 14:00.305
smartest, most
caring ponies I know

14:00.406 --> 14:02.106
and I can't think of anypony
better to leave in charge

14:02.209 --> 14:03.642
of my castle and the
School of Friendship.

14:03.744 --> 14:04.544
So what do you think?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.645
WHAT? You want ME to
take care of the castle

14:07.747 --> 14:09.480
and RUN THE SCHOOL?

14:09.682 --> 14:10.616
Yes?

14:10.718 --> 14:13.151
Ah! I can't! I'm
not ready!

14:13.253 --> 14:14.552
Remember what happened
the last time

14:14.654 --> 14:15.820
you left me in charge!?

14:16.122 --> 14:18.556
And now you want me
to do it PERMANENTLY?

14:18.658 --> 14:21.225
What if I don't do the
right things!? [gasping] What if--

14:21.327 --> 14:23.461
Starlight! Get a
hold of yourself.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.964
You've risen to every
challenge you've ever faced.

14:26.066 --> 14:29.634
You can do anything you put
your mind to. You've got this.

14:30.436 --> 14:34.505
Ha! And so do you!
See what I did there?

14:34.607 --> 14:37.042
You just said everything
YOU need to hear.

14:37.444 --> 14:41.112
Ha ha ha! Nice try, but running
a school and running a country

14:41.214 --> 14:42.247
are two very different things!

14:42.349 --> 14:44.348
Now if you don't
mind, I have 7,432

14:44.450 --> 14:46.018
more things to take
care of before I become

14:46.120 --> 14:47.452
the new Ruler of Equestria!

14:50.123 --> 14:51.890
It was a valiant effort.

15:27.193 --> 15:29.360
The guard says Sombra's
breached the castle!

15:29.462 --> 15:31.829
Hurry, Twilight! We need you!

15:33.566 --> 15:35.100
Do you have
Flurry Heart!?

15:35.602 --> 15:36.801
I thought
you had her!

15:37.003 --> 15:37.902
[gasp]
Ah!

15:39.773 --> 15:41.573
[whining] Mama!

15:43.543 --> 15:45.777
You won't get
away with this.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.080
Oh, but I
already have!

15:50.717 --> 15:54.385
Ha ha ha ha!

15:54.487 --> 15:57.388
With the Cyrstal heart
now in my possession,

15:57.490 --> 15:59.824
there is nothing to
stop me from ruling

15:59.926 --> 16:02.061
the Crystal Empire.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.230
Kneel before Sombra!

16:08.668 --> 16:12.471
Ah. Long live the King.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.645
Thanks for coming so quickly.

16:21.531 --> 16:23.514
Sure thing, but if you're
going to be the ruler

16:23.617 --> 16:26.251
of Equestria, you may want
to work on your penmanship.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.785
This looks like it says,

16:27.887 --> 16:30.288
"Cadance sent an
emergency message.

16:30.490 --> 16:34.259
Sombra's back and he's taking
over the Crystal Empire."

16:34.361 --> 16:36.094
That's exactly what it says!

16:36.196 --> 16:37.862
But... But how is that possible?

16:37.964 --> 16:39.830
I thought the Crystal
Heart had dispelled him

16:39.932 --> 16:41.065
into the Ether!

16:41.167 --> 16:43.801
I have no idea, but he's
back and it's up to us

16:43.903 --> 16:46.070
to save the Empire
and my family!

16:46.172 --> 16:48.606
Shouldn't somepony
tell Celestia and Luna?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.408
Oooh. Good point.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.644
One of us should probably
loop in the <i>real</i> rulers

16:53.746 --> 16:54.779
of Equestria.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.915
No. If we're going
to run Equestria,

16:58.017 --> 17:00.451
we'll need to handle things
like this on our own.

17:00.553 --> 17:04.555
Oh, Twilight! Could
this mean that you finally

17:04.657 --> 17:07.158
have the confidence to
ascend to the throne

17:07.260 --> 17:09.728
like the princesses
believe you can?

17:10.630 --> 17:14.699
Maybe... Unless you'd consider
taking care of Sombra for us?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.869
Oh, no no no no no. You
were absolutely right.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.806
You need to learn how to handle
these things on your own.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.041
Ta-tah.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.010
Handling things on our
own is all well and good,

17:26.112 --> 17:29.180
but last time we defeated
Sombra with the Crystal Heart.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.250
What if he has it already?
How are we gonna stop him?

17:40.260 --> 17:41.793
With the Elements of Harmony!

17:41.895 --> 17:45.396
With those, we can defeat
anypony, even Sombra!

17:45.498 --> 17:47.131
Ah no no no no.
You didn't need

17:47.233 --> 17:49.500
the "Elements" the last
time you defeated Sombra.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.070
And I'm not sure using
them still counts

17:52.172 --> 17:54.405
as handling things
on your own.

17:54.607 --> 17:58.843
My family is in danger.
I'm not taking any chances.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.711
She's got a point.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.446
Ugh. Fine.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.849
What's his problem?

18:05.151 --> 18:08.019
Starlight, can you stay here
and take care of the school?

18:08.121 --> 18:09.420
I've got you covered.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.578
It's cute that you think
that will do anything.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.315
It might not, but they will.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.683
Cavalry's here!

18:40.854 --> 18:44.021
[chuckle] How can I be surprised
when I'm waiting to show

18:44.123 --> 18:46.757
all of you your greatest fear?

19:04.511 --> 19:07.645
Oh, Twilight. How
disappointing.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.582
Equestria was in your care
and you let it be destroyed.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.653
You should all surrender.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.523
Nothing can defeat
your own fears.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.064
We didn't need to defeat them.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.899
We just needed to face them
long enough to distract you!

19:33.806 --> 19:35.874
NO!

19:36.776 --> 19:39.544
It's cute that you think
that will do anything.

19:50.723 --> 19:55.526
You may have won the battle,
but I shall win the war!

20:04.136 --> 20:05.636
Ya hoo hoo hoo!

20:08.074 --> 20:11.242
We totally just wiped
the castle with that guy.

20:16.683 --> 20:17.815
Thanks, Twily.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.351
But that was fun!

20:20.553 --> 20:21.753
And.. easy.

20:22.155 --> 20:24.889
As magical battles go,
that was a cakewalk.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.091
Mmmmm, "cakewalk".

20:30.463 --> 20:33.498
We did handle this
pretty well.. on our own.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.900
Does this mean--?

20:35.101 --> 20:37.701
I still don't feel like I'm
one hundred percent ready,

20:37.804 --> 20:38.936
but will I ever?

20:39.138 --> 20:40.872
Knowing you? Nope.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.810
I have you guys, and we have
the Elements, and together,

20:45.912 --> 20:48.446
we've never failed.
We'll be OK.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.658
Once again, Equestria is safe.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.026
What should we
do to celebrate?

21:02.228 --> 21:04.128
I vote for a cakewalk!

21:14.841 --> 21:15.673
What's going on?

21:16.075 --> 21:17.541
I don't know!
