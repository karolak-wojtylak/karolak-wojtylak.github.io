00:08.577 --> 00:11.150
Fuzzy Legs? Do you think you
could secure those windows?

00:14.177 --> 00:15.955
And you'll alert me
if anything scary

00:15.955 --> 00:17.155
comes close to
the cottage?

00:17.800 --> 00:19.250
Oh, who am I kidding?

00:19.488 --> 00:22.220
When something scary comes
close to the cottage.

00:22.533 --> 00:24.822
Please tell me my
hiding place is ready.

00:28.177 --> 00:31.000
Oh, look, you've filled
it with everything I need

00:31.000 --> 00:33.111
to survive this awful night.

00:34.177 --> 00:36.444
Thank you. Thank you all!

00:37.222 --> 00:39.155
Now I don't have to
step a hoof outside

00:39.155 --> 00:41.088
until this whole
thing is over.

00:45.644 --> 00:47.711
Oh, no! You don't
have any carrots?

00:48.333 --> 00:51.088
Do we have any other fresh
veggies you may enjoy?

00:51.466 --> 00:52.800
Or maybe some hay?

00:54.155 --> 00:56.400
But that means I'll
need to go out...

00:56.933 --> 00:58.755
...ON NIGHTMARE NIGHT?

01:10.400 --> 01:27.022

Fluttershy?

02:16.133 --> 02:17.800
What are you doing
out and about?

02:18.044 --> 02:20.177
It's Nightmare Night, remember?

02:20.488 --> 02:22.000
How could I forget?

02:23.133 --> 02:25.244
Oh, I don't suppose
I could borrow

02:25.244 --> 02:26.888
a few pieces of
hay from you.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.511
I forgot to stock
up on food for Angel

02:29.511 --> 02:31.644
and you do seem to
have quite a lot.

02:31.888 --> 02:34.644
We need it for the Apple
Family Haunted Maze.

02:34.955 --> 02:38.520
The scariest maze
that there ever was.

02:39.088 --> 02:41.333
Who knows what
lurks inside?

02:41.666 --> 02:43.890
Oh, I'm sure I don't.

02:44.355 --> 02:46.844
Is that a mummified pony
that just leaped out at you?

02:47.155 --> 02:48.900
I don't know, is it?

02:49.266 --> 02:52.370
And what's that crunching
sound beneath your hooves?

02:52.711 --> 02:56.711
Maybe it's the bones of ponies
that didn't make it out alive!

02:57.088 --> 02:58.410
B-b-b-bones?

02:58.644 --> 03:02.777
Are those peeled grapes or
a thousand slimy eyeballs

03:02.777 --> 03:04.800
starin' at you from
beyond the grave?

03:05.044 --> 03:07.210
Please tell me
they're grapes.

03:07.710 --> 03:09.232
Oh, I'll never
tell.

03:14.511 --> 03:16.177
I wonder what got
stuck in her craw?

03:24.600 --> 03:25.288
Twilight?

03:41.044 --> 03:43.488
You think it's scary now.
Just wait until it's done.

03:45.733 --> 03:47.590
That's OK. I'll take
your word for it.

03:50.577 --> 03:53.977
Hey, wait a minute!
It's Nightmare Night

03:54.177 --> 03:56.444
and you're here and not
holed up in your cottage!

03:57.066 --> 03:58.488
Does this mean what
I think it means?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.177
That I foolishly forgot to
stock up on food for Angel

04:01.177 --> 04:02.755
and had to go out
to get him something

04:02.755 --> 04:04.666
but got spooked in
town so I came here

04:04.666 --> 04:06.311
hoping Twilight had some
lettuce I could give him?

04:07.248 --> 04:09.072
Oh. I thought
maybe you'd decided

04:09.072 --> 04:10.000
to come out with us tonight.

04:10.256 --> 04:14.280
Goodness, no! I couldn't be
out tonight. I just couldn't.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.928
Technically speaking, you
already are out right now.

04:18.670 --> 04:20.496
Oh. I guess that is true.

04:20.944 --> 04:23.728
So what if you stayed out a
little longer with your friends?

04:24.016 --> 04:25.472
I know they'd be super excited.

04:26.016 --> 04:26.992
You think so?

04:27.232 --> 04:29.408
You would make them SO
happy if you joined in.

04:29.600 --> 04:30.784
They wouldn't
believe their eyes.

04:31.184 --> 04:33.280
Come on, Fluttershy,
what do you say?

04:38.496 --> 04:42.464
And then it
got very, very quiet

04:42.720 --> 04:44.288
and suddenly they
realized

04:44.512 --> 04:47.600
the BALLOONS HAD
NEVER BEEN INFLATED!

04:53.088 --> 04:57.376
Did I ever tell you about the
night the mannequin came to life

04:57.680 --> 04:59.792
and haunted all the costumes?

05:00.048 --> 05:00.864
What happened?

05:01.696 --> 05:02.688
I just told you, darling.

05:02.688 --> 05:04.976
A mannequin came to life and
haunted all the costumes.

05:06.192 --> 05:07.264
Hi, everypony.

05:08.544 --> 05:11.488
Fluttershy? What are you
doing here? Is everything okay?

05:11.824 --> 05:15.168
Everything is fine. In
fact, it's more than fine.

05:15.632 --> 05:19.232
I've decided to join you in your
Nightmare Night festivities.

05:21.168 --> 05:24.080
Seriously? You?
Out? Tonight?

05:25.776 --> 05:28.176
Every Nightmare Night I
shut myself in my cottage

05:28.176 --> 05:30.016
and refuse to come
out until morning.

05:30.224 --> 05:32.064
But it's just like when
I was afraid to sing

05:32.064 --> 05:33.200
in front of anypony.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.920
If I hadn't given it a try,

05:35.248 --> 05:37.872
I never would've found
out how much I enjoy it.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.670
And we'd have missed out
on how great you sound.

05:41.136 --> 05:43.248
Fluttershy with us
on Nightmare Night?

05:43.584 --> 05:45.680
Why that's positively
the most wonderful news

05:45.680 --> 05:47.340
I've heard in ages!

05:47.968 --> 05:49.776
You can get dressed up
in a costume with us

05:49.776 --> 05:51.184
and play Nightmare
Night games with us

05:51.184 --> 05:52.832
and eat candy apples with us!

05:53.008 --> 05:54.928
Don't forget the best part.

05:55.104 --> 05:57.008
Goin' through my
family's corn maze.

05:58.048 --> 05:59.750
Oh, right. The maze.

06:01.024 --> 06:02.448
Only if you're up for it.

06:03.824 --> 06:07.088
I am! I am ready to
take on Nightmare Night!

06:07.360 --> 06:08.760
AAAHHH!

06:13.744 --> 06:14.970
Just practicing.

06:28.496 --> 06:34.272
Mummy? No. Headless Pony?
No. Vampire Fruit Bat.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.336
Ugh, definitely no.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.752
You see, Fluttershy, the
beauty of Nightmare Night

06:40.752 --> 06:43.424
is that you don't have to
dress up as something scary.

06:45.904 --> 06:47.730
Ooh. Yes.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.904
This one will look
gorgeous on you.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.368
Period costumes are
all the rage this year.

06:54.224 --> 06:55.110
What? No good?

06:55.280 --> 06:57.056
What if we encounter
something terrifying

06:57.056 --> 06:58.272
and need to get
away quickly?

06:58.592 --> 07:02.096
All those layers could slow me
down, or worse, make me trip!

07:03.408 --> 07:04.620
I never
considered that.

07:05.056 --> 07:05.856
Never Fear!

07:07.008 --> 07:12.448
Oooh, now this is a real
stunner! I call it "Masquerade!"

07:13.120 --> 07:14.784
Just a simple black
dress underneath

07:14.992 --> 07:17.660
but with this ornately
decorated mask!

07:18.144 --> 07:18.976
A mask?

07:20.432 --> 07:21.216
No?

07:21.712 --> 07:24.400
They can just be so
difficult to see out of.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.784
Yes, but this one has eyeholes.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.032
What about being able to
see what's to the left

07:30.032 --> 07:31.136
or right of me?

07:32.256 --> 07:34.672
I suppose your vision
would be somewhat obscured.

07:35.376 --> 07:37.072
It's your first Nightmare
Night out and about

07:37.072 --> 07:38.750
and we do want you
to be comfortable.

07:39.056 --> 07:40.850
What if I just
wear the dress?

07:41.184 --> 07:45.296
Oh. Sure, dear.
That's fine.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.760
It's so plain,
it's frightening.

07:49.824 --> 07:53.904
Oh, my, look at all of you!
My costumes fit you to a T!

07:54.416 --> 07:57.280
Hoo-ee we're gonna
have the best time!

07:59.696 --> 08:02.540
Hey, Fluttershy,
where's your costume?

08:02.944 --> 08:03.792
I'm wearing it.

08:06.464 --> 08:09.008
I get it! You're a robber
escaping into the night!

08:09.376 --> 08:11.616
You're a NINJA escaping
into the night!

08:12.192 --> 08:14.720
YOU'RE BLACK LICORICE
escaping into the night!

08:14.970 --> 08:18.912
Close. I'm going to a masquerade
ball. Without the mask.

08:21.088 --> 08:24.672
Oh, that's great!
Isn't it great?

08:24.800 --> 08:26.656
Oh, yeah.
Great costume.
So creative!

08:34.288 --> 08:36.896
I figured I'd save the really
scary games for next year

08:36.896 --> 08:38.210
when Fluttershy's
more used to it.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.728
Round and round and round you
go where you stop nopony knows!

08:46.112 --> 08:47.696
OK, GO!

08:52.448 --> 08:54.912
Good luck beating
THAT, Fluttershy!

08:56.528 --> 08:59.584
Well, um. It's just
that if I'm blindfolded

08:59.584 --> 09:01.408
and somepony were to
leap out in front of me,

09:01.648 --> 09:03.936
I'd never have the
chance to defend myself.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.504
That's fine, darling.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.112
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

09:10.368 --> 09:11.808
We're just glad
you're here.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.344
We don't have to
finish that game;

09:13.520 --> 09:17.280
I have another one I KNOW you'll
love! Bobbing for apples!

09:20.448 --> 09:22.032
Fluttershy, what's wrong?

09:22.320 --> 09:24.672
It's just that, um,
what happens if,

09:24.672 --> 09:26.190
when my head is deep
down in the water,

09:26.190 --> 09:28.176
some kind of scary
monster appears?

09:28.544 --> 09:30.784
How would I even hear to
know I was under attack?

09:33.440 --> 09:35.296
Time for candy!

09:35.520 --> 09:36.070
It is?

09:36.592 --> 09:37.616
I made candy bags!

09:37.792 --> 09:40.096
Each bag has been made
with each of YOU in mind,

09:40.224 --> 09:42.672
complete with each of
your favorite candies!

09:44.240 --> 09:45.024
Awesome!

09:47.584 --> 09:50.576
Here. Take it. Take it!
What are you waiting for?

09:50.820 --> 09:52.432
Well, it's just...

09:52.800 --> 09:55.232
what if when I'm eating one
of these chewy taffies,

09:55.392 --> 09:58.336
my mouth becomes glued shut and
I can't scream for help?

10:04.880 --> 10:08.112
Oh, goodness. We've only
just started to celebrate

10:08.112 --> 10:09.270
Nightmare Night together

10:09.504 --> 10:12.032
and I'm already taking all
the fun out of it, aren't I?

10:13.376 --> 10:15.610
You're not taking
out ALL the fun.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.664
Just like, 90 per--

10:18.912 --> 10:19.610
--some of it.

10:19.872 --> 10:21.344
I really want to do this.

10:21.776 --> 10:25.440
But there's just so many things
that terrify me about tonight,

10:25.824 --> 10:28.384
I couldn't possibly predict
what might upset me.

10:31.856 --> 10:35.230
Unless... YOU were the
one doing the scaring!

10:35.760 --> 10:37.776
HER scaring US?

10:42.768 --> 10:44.560
Oh, you're being serious.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.810
The thing you hate
is being scared,

10:47.072 --> 10:51.136
but if YOU'RE the one
doing the scaring then...

10:52.400 --> 10:54.368
....then I can help
you all have fun,

10:54.576 --> 10:57.020
and I can still be a
part of Nightmare Night!

10:57.424 --> 10:59.216
So you like that idea?

10:59.472 --> 11:00.690
I think I do!

11:00.912 --> 11:02.448
And I don't want to
get ahead of myself,

11:02.880 --> 11:06.160
but I think I have the PERFECT
idea for how I'm going to do it!

11:06.496 --> 11:08.720
Really? This is so exciting!

11:09.072 --> 11:12.176
Meet me at my
cottage in an hour.

11:13.248 --> 11:15.120
I'm excited to see
everypony soon!

11:27.968 --> 11:32.190
<i>Welcome</i>
<i> to Fluttershy's tea party!</i>

11:32.624 --> 11:34.528
Did she just
say tea party?

11:34.912 --> 11:38.256
It sounds like it's
a scary tea party?

11:40.992 --> 11:41.936
<i>Have a seat.</i>

11:46.464 --> 11:49.200
<i> Don't be scared of</i>
<i> what awaits you!</i>

11:49.952 --> 11:52.800
<i> Go on. Pass the sugar.</i>

11:54.040 --> 11:56.976
<i>Oh, no! There is none!</i>

11:58.912 --> 12:01.180
<i>You're a terrible host!</i>

12:01.600 --> 12:04.180
<i> Rarity, put your coat on!</i>

12:04.640 --> 12:06.176
Why would I do that?

12:06.304 --> 12:12.000
<i>You need to cover up because no</i>
<i>one has complimented your dress!</i>

12:13.056 --> 12:17.200
<i>Pinkie Pie, look to your left</i>
<i>and ask your best friend</i>

12:17.200 --> 12:20.730
<i>to pass the cucumber sandwiches!</i>

12:20.976 --> 12:24.128
Huh? I can't!
There's nopony there!

12:24.672 --> 12:29.140
<i> That's right. Because she</i>
<i> didn't care to show up!</i>

12:29.760 --> 12:30.352
What?

12:30.688 --> 12:32.310
<i> A friend who didn't</i>
<i> come through!</i>

12:32.688 --> 12:35.408
<i>That must scare you to the core!</i>

12:35.950 --> 12:37.904
<i> Quick, everypony,</i>
<i> look behind you!</i>

12:38.688 --> 12:40.576
Uh, what are those?

12:40.928 --> 12:45.360
<i> They're unplanned guests!</i>
<i> Your worst nightmare!</i>

12:45.712 --> 12:47.680
<i> You don't have</i>
<i> enough food for them!</i>

12:49.344 --> 12:53.130
<i> Oh, no! There's a tiny</i>
<i> kitten that needs a home!</i>

12:53.408 --> 12:55.680
<i> But you are</i>
<i> over-scheduled right now.</i>

12:56.032 --> 12:57.792
<i> You don't have time to help!</i>

12:59.088 --> 13:02.960
<i> I said, you don't</i>
<i> have time to help!</i>

13:05.248 --> 13:07.808
<i>This should appear to scare you!</i>

13:11.488 --> 13:14.448
Why don't you look terrified?
You showed up to a party

13:14.448 --> 13:16.656
and everypony was extremely
disappointed in you.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.328
Can you imagine
anything more upsetting?

13:19.880 --> 13:22.000
It was a really
good try, darling

13:22.000 --> 13:23.504
but the scares at
Nightmare Night

13:23.504 --> 13:25.680
are of an entirely
different nature.

13:25.936 --> 13:28.100
It was really
creative, though.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.456
I never would have
thought of... all this.

13:32.878 --> 13:37.916
Oh, I'm just not cut out for
this. Just go on without me.

13:38.272 --> 13:40.368
Oh, no, we
couldn't possibly.

13:40.592 --> 13:44.320
You have to. This is the night
you look forward to all year.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.864
We could...stay here?

13:47.680 --> 13:50.400
It's OK. I really want
you all to have fun.

13:51.168 --> 13:53.120
This is how I spend
every Nightmare Night!

13:54.144 --> 13:56.592
Please go, I'll be fine.

13:57.872 --> 14:00.000
It's funny; I actually
thought she had an idea

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
for something really
scary for a second there!

14:02.528 --> 14:04.416
She definitely
tried her hardest!

14:06.992 --> 14:09.110
I did try my hardest.

14:13.264 --> 14:14.720
Or maybe not.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.824
I suppose I could have gone
with something a bit scarier.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.480
You're right. I've
been taking baby steps.

14:22.672 --> 14:25.072
I think it's time
for grown up ones.

14:26.368 --> 14:29.200
I don't suppose you have any
ideas how I could do that?

14:35.584 --> 14:38.560
Everypony's lining up for the
corn maze, y'all. Let's go!

14:39.370 --> 14:42.464
Oh, yeah! I can't believe
we're finally doing this!

14:50.848 --> 14:53.280
It's a good thing
Fluttershy isn't here

14:53.280 --> 14:56.112
because she would NEVER
be able to handle this!

15:09.640 --> 15:10.256
AGH!

15:10.624 --> 15:12.940
Boo...yup.

15:19.984 --> 15:23.792
What. Is. That. Sound?

15:25.856 --> 15:28.208
It looks like...bones!

15:30.752 --> 15:33.776
Looks like a bunch of dried
sticks painted white to me.

15:34.064 --> 15:37.008
Hey, TRY to keep up the
illusion, would ya?

15:53.376 --> 15:54.784
Agh! What was that?

15:57.696 --> 15:58.690
Don't you know?

15:58.944 --> 16:01.808
Uh, course I do.
It was uh...

16:19.410 --> 16:21.536
Fluttershy had a point with
the layers on the dress.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.450
AGH!

16:32.096 --> 16:34.640
What is this? Is it a
tunnel? Where does it lead?

16:40.848 --> 16:42.528
Which way are we
supposed to go now?

16:43.120 --> 16:45.568
I don't know! I don't
know what's going on!

16:47.344 --> 16:50.096
What do you mean? Didn't
you help plan this?

16:52.992 --> 16:55.248
Oh, there's
Granny Smith.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.576
Not that I was EVER
scared. Cause I wasn't.

16:58.896 --> 17:01.136
I'm a pretty good
actress when I wanna be.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.020
Granny?

17:12.632 --> 17:15.233
Applejack, didn't you
know about any of this?

17:15.568 --> 17:18.496
All right, I gotts admit I
didn't know about any of this.

17:18.560 --> 17:21.824
But maybe they're just tryin' to
make it interestin' for me too!

17:22.128 --> 17:24.272
I'm sure Granny Smith or
Big Mac is behind this.

17:24.864 --> 17:26.540
Are those
peeled grapes?

17:26.880 --> 17:30.528
Or eyeballs starin' at you from
beyond the grave.

17:34.288 --> 17:34.960
Eyup.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.320
That's what WE were
supposed to do!

17:40.720 --> 17:42.220
I don't know why
we're down here!

17:42.544 --> 17:44.120
This is really
scarin' me now!

17:58.480 --> 17:59.792
How did that get down here??

18:01.872 --> 18:03.216
RUN!

18:08.832 --> 18:10.672
I can't see!

18:10.880 --> 18:12.720
I can barely move!

18:14.240 --> 18:15.632
It's like glue!

18:15.792 --> 18:17.280
AGH!

19:01.408 --> 19:02.384
Oh, my!

19:05.310 --> 19:10.176
I'm so, so sorry,
can you ever forgive me?

19:11.344 --> 19:12.310
FLUTTERSHY?

19:12.592 --> 19:14.688
It was you the
whole time?

19:14.864 --> 19:16.672
I can't believe it!

19:17.760 --> 19:19.296
That. Was.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.552
THE BEST THING EVER!

19:22.592 --> 19:25.392
It was way more terrifying
than the most terrifying thing

19:25.392 --> 19:26.800
I could have thought of!

19:27.200 --> 19:30.336
You out-nightmared the scariest
part of the corn maze!

19:30.464 --> 19:32.500
How did you do all this?

19:32.848 --> 19:35.312
After you left, I realized
that I wasn't ready

19:35.312 --> 19:36.768
to give up on Nightmare Night.

19:37.024 --> 19:39.600
So I asked Granny Smith if I
could try to make the maze

19:39.600 --> 19:41.610
even scarier for
my friends.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.016
You came up with
all of this?

19:44.528 --> 19:45.680
I had some help.

19:49.296 --> 19:52.384
Angel was the scary figure
that kept scurrying after you

19:52.384 --> 19:53.320
in the maze.

19:55.856 --> 19:57.360
Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall

19:57.360 --> 19:59.472
that made it difficult
for you to see and move.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.920
And of course Hairy was the
especially scary monster.

20:08.048 --> 20:10.700
Wow. That was inspired.

20:11.088 --> 20:13.344
You have to do
this EVERY YEAR!

20:16.352 --> 20:20.432
We could celebrate Nightmare
Night together every year.

20:20.832 --> 20:24.080
But the truth is I
really don't want to.

20:24.752 --> 20:26.080
You DON'T?

20:26.336 --> 20:27.616
But you've done it.

20:27.856 --> 20:30.928
You've found a way we can all
have a fabulous time together.

20:31.136 --> 20:34.930
Yes, but I've also
realized something.

20:35.328 --> 20:37.216
You all may love
Nightmare Night

20:37.584 --> 20:40.960
and I may be good at being a
part of it, but it's no fun

20:40.960 --> 20:43.456
for me to see my friends
feel like they're in danger,

20:43.824 --> 20:45.232
even if I know they're not.

20:45.744 --> 20:49.280
I really don't like it. It's
just not my cup of tea.

20:49.776 --> 20:51.824
Spooky tea?

20:52.656 --> 20:55.200
No. Just regular tea.

20:55.984 --> 20:58.112
We do lots of fun
things together.

20:58.544 --> 21:01.120
But I'm afraid this just isn't
going to be one of them.

21:01.504 --> 21:05.630
Actually, I'm not afraid;
I'm perfectly fine with it.

21:06.144 --> 21:07.568
Then we are too.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.847
I don't know why I doubted
myself for a second.

21:23.152 --> 21:27.792
Now THIS is what I call a
perfect Nightmare Night.
