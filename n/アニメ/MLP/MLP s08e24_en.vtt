WEBVTT

00:08.676 --> 00:10.276
Twilight: Whoo hoo hoo!

00:10.578 --> 00:11.243
Whoa!

00:14.081 --> 00:14.914
<i> ♪ Tada! ♪</i>

00:15.983 --> 00:18.150
OK, Spike. Now
let's try a flip.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.786
Remember, two flaps
then straight up.

00:21.922 --> 00:22.588
Got it!

00:39.440 --> 00:41.073
You're doing great, Spike.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.209
Now let's see the big finish!

00:51.152 --> 00:53.552
Ahhhhh!

00:57.758 --> 01:02.228
[sigh] I don't know about
big, but I am definitely finished.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.396
Maybe I should
get Rainbow Dash.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.066
She's the one who taught me
advanced flying techniques.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.467
No thanks.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.271
If I'm going to mess up I'd
rather do it in front of you.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.907
I just don't understand why
none of your advice is helping.

01:15.009 --> 01:16.875
Because she's teaching
you to fly like a pony

01:16.977 --> 01:18.410
instead of a dragon.

01:18.712 --> 01:19.912
What's the difference?

01:20.014 --> 01:22.314
Well, we don't have
feathers for starters.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.253
Yeah-heh-heh!

01:37.598 --> 01:40.399
Wow! Thank
you so much!

01:40.501 --> 01:43.268
How did you know I just
needed to bend my wings?

01:43.370 --> 01:45.404
Honestly, this is Dragon 101.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.806
Usually dragon parents
teach this stuff.

01:52.179 --> 01:52.878
Spike?

01:52.980 --> 01:55.180
I've been thinking
about our flying lesson.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.215
Spike: Uh huh?

01:56.317 --> 01:59.418
I can't believe I overlooked
something as simple as feathers.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.453
It's no wonder you
were having trouble.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.292
I wish I had more dragon-ish
knowledge to give you.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.893
Do you think being
raised by ponies

02:07.995 --> 02:09.929
has affected you
in other ways?

02:11.031 --> 02:11.764
Spike?

02:12.066 --> 02:13.633
Did you say something, Twilight?

02:13.835 --> 02:15.701
Sorry. I'm just finishing
up this "Thank You"

02:15.803 --> 02:16.869
throw pillow for Smolder.

02:17.071 --> 02:19.705
And you know how I get when
I'm in the embroidery zone.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.749
It's a pillow. But
not for your head.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.751
Although it could be.
It's a throw pillow.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.987
They're more casual. You
can use them anywhere.

03:08.989 --> 03:09.889
You don't like it.

03:10.091 --> 03:12.357
Uh it's not that. It's just,

03:12.459 --> 03:14.626
dragons don't
really use pillows.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.627
At all.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.428
What?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.730
Hey, what's that?

03:18.132 --> 03:21.533
I don't know, but it's
HEADING RIGHT FOR US!

03:26.273 --> 03:28.840
OK. Now I REALLY owe
you for the lesson.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.547
Heh heh. Hey there,
young dragons.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.549
Name's Sludge.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.950
How are your
tails shaking?

03:39.052 --> 03:39.785
Oooh!

03:40.687 --> 03:41.687
Are you all right?

03:41.789 --> 03:43.355
Yeah. What
happened?

03:43.857 --> 03:44.923
To what?
[crash]

03:45.692 --> 03:46.459
Oh.

03:46.961 --> 03:51.230
I don't need to explain myself
to a couple of baby dragons.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.771
[crash] Ow!

03:58.873 --> 04:01.273
Maybe not, but you're
hurt and need help,

04:01.475 --> 04:03.142
so I'm taking you to
Twilight's Castle

04:03.244 --> 04:04.843
whether you like it or not.

04:05.145 --> 04:08.012
Castle, eh? [moan]

04:10.284 --> 04:12.217
I'm glad Spike brought
you here, Sludge.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.886
I understand you made quite
an impression in town.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.456
Literally. There's a
hole and everything!

04:17.558 --> 04:20.292
Well, I hope you're not
expecting me to fix it.

04:22.096 --> 04:25.597
It doesn't look like you're
in much shape to do anything.

04:25.799 --> 04:29.434
I'll manage. Dragons
take care of themselves.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.938
I don't need help from a
bunch of castle-living ponies.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.442
Darling, do be careful.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.878
I'm [groan] fine.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.115
I can't watch!

04:43.217 --> 04:46.218
You're not the first stubborn,
dragon we've met, you know.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.820
And sometimes even
dragons need help.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.625
I promise, my friends and
I will only do enough

04:53.727 --> 04:55.460
to get you back on your claws.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.224
I know you had
your reservations,

06:32.326 --> 06:34.026
but it's good to see
you feeling better.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.195
Thanks? I guess?

06:36.497 --> 06:38.730
That's what friends
are for, darling!

06:40.501 --> 06:42.901
You're pretty lucky to have
friends like these, kid.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.737
Actually I was orphaned as an
egg and Twilight raised me,

06:45.839 --> 06:47.472
so these ponies are
more than my friends.

06:47.674 --> 06:48.658
They're my family.

06:48.759 --> 06:52.443
We try our best, but sometimes I
worry maybe Spike is--

06:52.546 --> 06:55.615
--missing something deep
down and dragonish.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.983
Really? Wow.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.385
I can't tell you how
glad I am to hear that.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.856
Why in Equestria would
you be glad to hear that?

07:04.258 --> 07:05.824
I wasn't going
to say anything,

07:05.926 --> 07:07.959
since your life
seems so perfect,

07:08.061 --> 07:10.161
but I have a
confession to make.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.165
Coming to Ponyville
wasn't an accident.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.534
I was looking for you.

07:15.736 --> 07:19.004
Spike, [sigh] I'm your father.

07:23.109 --> 07:23.775
Sorry!

07:27.147 --> 07:30.015
So, you crashed in
Ponyville on purpose?

07:30.217 --> 07:34.387
Well, the crash part wasn't on
purpose, but heading here was.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.556
I've been searching
everywhere for you, kid.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.258
Did you ask in the
Crystal Empire?

07:40.360 --> 07:42.060
I'm kind of well
known there.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.362
Actually, Spike's
well known everywhere.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.196
Not a lot of dragons

07:45.298 --> 07:47.232
were hatched by the
Princess of Friendship.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.233
Mm hm.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.602
You make it sound so simple.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.837
I wish you'd been there
to help me search.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.175
I can't believe it...

07:57.477 --> 07:59.077
I have so many questions!

07:59.179 --> 08:00.378
Well, ask away!

08:00.480 --> 08:03.548
Answering questions
is what dads are for!

08:03.850 --> 08:06.384
I guess my biggest
question is simple.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.553
Why was I an
orphaned egg?

08:08.655 --> 08:11.389
Uh! You sure you don't wanna
ask something else?

08:11.491 --> 08:14.025
It's a lot of painful memories.

08:17.764 --> 08:21.433
Your mother was the best
dragon I'd ever met.

08:22.635 --> 08:26.137
<i> The Dragon Lord even</i>
<i> picked her to scout for the Great Migration</i>

08:26.239 --> 08:29.440
<i> and.. and even though she'd</i>
<i> just laid your egg,</i>

08:29.542 --> 08:31.376
<i> we knew she'd have to go.</i>

08:31.478 --> 08:34.479
<i> But finding the Migration</i>
<i> route could take a lifetime</i>

08:34.681 --> 08:38.149
<i> and you deserved a chance</i>
<i> to know your mother.</i>

08:38.351 --> 08:41.620
<i> So I went looking for her,</i>
<i> carried your egg to places</i>

08:41.722 --> 08:45.490
<i> no dragon, or pony,</i>
<i> has ever been.</i>

08:45.592 --> 08:48.927
<i> Past Mount Aris, the abandoned</i>
<i> home of the Hippogriffs.</i>

08:49.129 --> 08:49.995
Oooh!

08:50.097 --> 08:51.530
Did you visit Klugetown?

08:51.832 --> 08:53.498
You've been to Klugetown?

08:53.600 --> 08:54.899
All: Uh huh!

08:55.001 --> 08:57.202
Also, the Hypogriffs
returned to Mount Aris

08:57.304 --> 08:59.170
after we helped them
defeat the Storm King.

08:59.272 --> 09:03.308
Oh well, have you heard of the
Land of the.. Scale Collectors?

09:03.410 --> 09:04.143
Uh uh.

09:04.345 --> 09:08.113
Because, that's where your
mother's trail finally led

09:08.715 --> 09:12.283
<i> to a prison world</i>
<i> of dragon hunters,</i>

09:12.485 --> 09:14.452
<i> where I was forced</i>
<i> to choose between</i>

09:14.554 --> 09:18.824
<i> surrendering myself or</i>
<i> surrendering your egg.</i>

09:19.426 --> 09:23.662
<i> Of course, there was no way</i>
<i> I was gonna sacrifice my boy,</i>

09:23.764 --> 09:25.397
<i> so they took me instead</i>

09:25.799 --> 09:27.832
<i> and that's where I've</i>
<i> been ever since.</i>

09:28.234 --> 09:30.601
Locked up somewhere
not even the

09:30.803 --> 09:33.237
Princess of Friendship
has heard of.

09:33.339 --> 09:34.606
Whoa!

09:35.208 --> 09:36.608
How did you know I was a boy?

09:36.710 --> 09:38.710
What ever happened
to Spike's mom?

09:38.812 --> 09:42.346
And how did the egg make it all
the way back to Equestria

09:42.448 --> 09:44.382
by itself?
-Hm?

09:44.484 --> 09:46.684
I wish I had all the answers!

09:49.040 --> 09:50.540
Well, that's all
in the past.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.991
The only thing that matters
now is that we're together,

09:53.193 --> 09:55.259
and I'm gonna make
up for lost time.

09:57.730 --> 09:58.796
I hope you don't mind,

09:58.898 --> 10:00.165
but I have a list
of all the things

10:00.267 --> 10:01.900
I always wanted to
do with my dad.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.034
Mind?

10:03.136 --> 10:05.804
Spike, my boy, with
you by my side,

10:05.906 --> 10:08.206
I feel like we can do anything!

10:08.708 --> 10:10.208
What do you
wanna do first?

10:10.310 --> 10:14.579
Well, I've kind of been working
on the list for a long time.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.449
Oh! You wanna do <i>all</i> of this?

10:18.651 --> 10:21.086
Oh, I mean, we
don't have to...

10:24.858 --> 10:28.459
If you think doing everything
on this incredibly long list

10:28.561 --> 10:31.863
is gonna fill the hole where
your dragonishness should be,

10:31.965 --> 10:34.832
then that is exactly
what we're gonna do!

10:44.944 --> 10:46.044
Oh yeah!

11:24.584 --> 11:26.951
I can't believe we
got so many things done!

11:27.353 --> 11:29.253
But this is all my stuff...

11:31.358 --> 11:33.859
Is there anything you
always wanted to do with me?

11:34.661 --> 11:35.594
Not really.

11:37.397 --> 11:41.299
Er.. I-I mean, I'm happy to
do whatever you want,

11:41.501 --> 11:45.504
but.. if I had a castle like
this, with all this stuff,

11:45.806 --> 11:48.172
I'd probably just
lay around all day

11:48.274 --> 11:50.775
doing nothing like
a real dragon.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.577
Like a <i>real</i> dragon?

11:52.879 --> 11:56.114
Sure. I'm not surprised
you don't know any better.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.917
Twilight basically
raised you as a pony.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.185
You're barely a dragon at all...!

12:01.387 --> 12:02.120
Huh!?

12:05.892 --> 12:06.624
Hey, Spike.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.293
How are things
going with Sludge?

12:08.595 --> 12:10.795
Honestly, I thought
having him around

12:10.897 --> 12:12.831
would make me feel
more dragonish,

12:13.133 --> 12:15.100
but I kinda feel less.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.002
Oh I'm sorry. I wish
I could help.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.937
Sludge: Aw, shucks.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.108
I guess I shouldn't
have said anything

12:24.210 --> 12:26.911
about you being more
pony than dragon.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.280
I just wish we had
more in common.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.183
Maybe you two can come up with
ways to turn up Spike's..

12:32.285 --> 12:34.219
uh- dragonishness!

12:35.021 --> 12:36.588
You think that's
something we can do?

12:36.890 --> 12:39.223
You know what, son?
I think it is!

12:41.861 --> 12:44.162
Spike, I'm gonna teach
you a thing or two

12:44.264 --> 12:45.730
about being a dragon.

12:45.832 --> 12:50.035
So listen up, my boy, because
I'm only gonna say this once.

See, what did

14:51.557 --> 14:53.057
You're very lucky
that I found you!

14:53.159 --> 14:54.592
Now go get me
some more.

14:54.694 --> 14:55.694
You got it!

14:55.796 --> 14:58.930
I'm gonna go get you all the
cushy pony stuff I've got...

14:59.332 --> 15:00.064

15:00.166 --> 15:01.632

15:14.915 --> 15:17.582
[knocking] Spike?

15:17.784 --> 15:19.784
I just thought I'd check
to see if you and Sludge

15:19.886 --> 15:21.987
had any luck turning up
your dragonishness.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.688
It's hard not to
feel like somehow

15:23.790 --> 15:25.456
I let you down
all these years.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.694
Oh! I'm so sorry.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.462
I didn't mean to
barge in on you.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.899
Don't worry about it.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.702
Mi castle es su castle!

15:38.872 --> 15:41.439
Right.... well, I'll just get
out of your way.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.446
Oh! Spike.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.480
I am so sorry.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.315
My morning is not going well.

15:52.519 --> 15:53.418
What is all this?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.386
Why'd you leave the
Castle so early?

15:55.488 --> 15:57.455
I didn't leave, I spent
the night outdoors

15:57.557 --> 15:59.524
to get in touch with
my dragon side.

15:59.826 --> 16:00.959
Outdoors?

16:01.161 --> 16:02.828
Yeah! And Sludge
asked me to bring him

16:02.930 --> 16:04.696
the best breakfast
Ponyville has to offer

16:04.798 --> 16:07.131
so he can show me how
a real dragon would eat it.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.132
See you later!
[door slams]

16:11.838 --> 16:14.104
And that's why I thought we
could use the map to--

16:15.808 --> 16:16.675
Hey, gang.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.843
Dad was just showing me how
a real dragon would act

16:18.945 --> 16:19.845
in the throne room.

16:21.915 --> 16:25.115
Dragons like to sprawl when
they get their claws done.

16:27.954 --> 16:31.990
Now, if you'll all excuse
me, it's time for my bath.

16:32.660 --> 16:34.893
[sigh] Isn't he the best!?

16:35.595 --> 16:39.631
I'm not sure that's exactly
the word I would use.

16:39.933 --> 16:40.999
Um, Spike?

16:41.101 --> 16:43.067
The bath isn't gonna
fill itself, son.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.570
Be right there, Dad!

16:52.212 --> 16:54.479
I'm glad you're not spending
the night outside again.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.347
Oh, I am. I'm
just looking for

16:56.449 --> 16:58.817
a good bedtime story to
read to my dad first.

16:58.919 --> 17:01.986
It's nice that you have somepony
to show you dragon culture,

17:02.288 --> 17:04.655
but are you sure that's
what Sludge is doing?

17:04.757 --> 17:05.557
What do you mean?

17:05.658 --> 17:08.958
Well, taking over your room,
making a mess of things...

17:09.361 --> 17:10.028
Pffft.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.763
That <i>is</i> dragon culture.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.765
You never acted like that.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.600
That's because <i>you</i> raised me.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.337
Now I finally have a chance
to see how I'm supposed to be.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.105
I don't think you're
supposed to be any different

17:21.207 --> 17:22.407
than who you are.

17:22.609 --> 17:25.776
Maybe you just don't like
that I have a real parent now.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.615
That's not true...

17:30.717 --> 17:32.216
I'm glad Sludge is here.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.518
I just wish he wasn't such a...

17:33.620 --> 17:35.920
Dragon? Of all ponies,

17:36.222 --> 17:38.621
I can't believe <i>you</i>
would have a problem with that.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.325
Oh..

17:49.402 --> 17:50.735
What happened to you?

17:51.037 --> 17:52.804
Just sleeping outside
like we're meant to.

17:53.106 --> 17:56.007
It's not like dragons are
supposed to live in castles.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.575
I guess not.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.077
But I live in
the school.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.512
Nothing says we <i>have</i>
to live outside.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.782
[sigh] I'm so confused.

18:03.984 --> 18:06.584
It's been great having Sludge
show me how to be a real dragon,

18:06.886 --> 18:08.553
but Twilight just
doesn't get it.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.055
What do you mean?

18:11.157 --> 18:13.958
She can't handle how good
at being a dragon Sludge is.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.427
Maybe someday I'll be able to
lay around doing nothing

18:16.529 --> 18:17.695
as well as he does.

18:18.197 --> 18:18.930
What?

18:19.032 --> 18:20.865
Well, not now, of course.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.733
I'm too busy bringing
him pony stuff

18:22.835 --> 18:24.903
so he can show me what a
dragon would do with it.

18:25.005 --> 18:27.105
So, Sludge just lays around

18:27.207 --> 18:29.709
while you wait on
him claw and tail?

18:30.911 --> 18:33.378
Uh, dragons are
rude and rebellious,

18:33.480 --> 18:36.748
but they aren't lazy lumps who
take advantage of their kids.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.583
Huh. Now I'm really confused.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.086
Me too.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.754
Why don't you tell me
everything Sludge said

18:43.856 --> 18:45.156
about being a dragon.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.126
Hey!

18:48.228 --> 18:49.727
What's going on, son?

18:49.829 --> 18:52.530
Twilight doesn't like having
real dragons in the castle

18:52.632 --> 18:54.265
so I told her we're moving out.

18:55.835 --> 18:56.767
You what!?

18:56.869 --> 18:57.735
Spike!

18:57.837 --> 19:00.338
I found the perfect cave
where you two can live.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.541
There aren't even any
comfortable rocks inside.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.409
That does
sound perfect!

19:05.511 --> 19:06.745
No, it doesn't!

19:07.047 --> 19:11.616
I-I-I mean, I'm not sure I've fully
demonstrated all the ways

19:11.718 --> 19:13.384
a dragon would live here.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.955
But we're not gonna live here
anymore, so it doesn't matter.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.690
It matters to me!

19:18.992 --> 19:23.828
I..... I want to make sure you have
all the knowledge you need.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.063
But I do!

19:25.165 --> 19:28.099
Dad, you've already
shared so much.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.134
<i> ♪ This bed is much too soft. ♪</i>

19:30.336 --> 19:32.203
<i> ♪ Just take that</i>
<i> silk robe off. ♪</i>

19:32.505 --> 19:36.106
<i> ♪ We can't be dragons</i>
<i> living here! ♪</i>

19:45.184 --> 19:46.751
ARGH! Stop!

19:47.153 --> 19:49.420
I'm not your father!
-What?

19:49.522 --> 19:52.958
I just said that to get in
on this sweet castle life.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.962
So... you pretended to be my dad?

19:58.364 --> 20:01.732
Na nana. Don't look at
me like that, kid.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.868
I did what any dragon would do.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.170
No, you didn't.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.574
Hey, I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.109
That's what dragons do.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.178
No. It isn't.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.946
You know what? I
don't need this.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.047
I'm out of here.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.883
Enjoy livin' in pony town...!

20:21.187 --> 20:22.488
I'm taking this pillow.

20:23.390 --> 20:26.156
I can't believe I thought
somepony like <i>that</i>

20:26.458 --> 20:28.661
could show me how
to be.. anything.

20:28.863 --> 20:34.198
[sigh] It must be hard growing up not
really knowing who you are.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.500
That's the thing.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.870
I know exactly who I am,
and how I got that way.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.343
Um, Twilight?

20:45.445 --> 20:48.780
Oh. Hi. Where's
your.. father?

20:49.282 --> 20:50.115
He's gone.

20:50.317 --> 20:53.451
Turns out he wasn't what a real
dragon should be after all.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.287
He also wasn't my real dad.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.324
Oh, Spike... I'm so sorry.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.993
I'm the one who's sorry.

21:02.195 --> 21:04.762
You were just worried about
me and I lost my temper.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.565
Sludge was just a
great big phony.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.234
I have to say, I'm not surprised.

21:10.336 --> 21:13.171
There's no way a dragon like
that was related to you.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.840
But if you still want to
search for your real family,

21:15.942 --> 21:18.809
I'd understand if you spent
more time in the Dragonlands.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.044
I don't think so.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.947
I already know who
my <i>real</i> family is.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.316
Oooh! It's me, right?

21:25.418 --> 21:27.019
Mm hm! Besides...

21:28.121 --> 21:30.922
There's no way I'm
living without pillows.
