00:01.911 --> 00:04.812
Oh, Opalescence. Can you just picture it?

00:04.813 --> 00:10.372
Moi, stepping up in astounding new gown
at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!

00:14.436 --> 00:17.052
Why, yes! I did make it myself.

00:17.053 --> 00:19.296
Thank you so much for asking.

00:26.113 --> 00:29.199
Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you.

00:33.096 --> 00:35.577
What's that? You wanna help me more!

00:35.578 --> 00:38.093
Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?

00:42.432 --> 00:45.642
Careful now. Don't move.
This shouldn't take long at all.

01:31.435 --> 01:32.670
Howdy, Rarity?

01:33.289 --> 01:36.543
Shh... Can't you see Rarity
is trying to concentrate?

01:38.156 --> 01:39.986
What do you think she's makin'?

01:40.015 --> 01:41.471
Looks like a dress.

01:42.063 --> 01:45.777
Well, that makes sense.
Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.706
Is there something I can help you with?

01:48.744 --> 01:52.931
Oh, so very sorry to trouble you,
Rarity, but I need a quick favor.

01:55.269 --> 01:59.285
Could you please fix the button for me?
It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.

02:00.380 --> 02:05.376
Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing.

02:05.767 --> 02:07.986
You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala.

02:07.987 --> 02:11.501
And I'll make it for you. No problem at all.
It will be my pleasure!

02:11.727 --> 02:16.164
Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer,
Rarity, but I can't let you do that.

02:16.165 --> 02:19.242
It would be so much work. This dress is fine.

02:19.367 --> 02:23.256
Twilight Sparkle.
I insist on making you a new dress.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.800
-But...
-No no, not a word!

02:25.006 --> 02:27.102
I won't take no for an answer.

02:27.150 --> 02:31.408
Well, in that case... Thank you
for your generosity, Rarity.

02:31.409 --> 02:35.088
Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure
it will be absolutely beautiful.

02:37.434 --> 02:41.049
Let me guess, Applejack.
You don't want a new gown either.

02:41.050 --> 02:44.411
Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna
wear my old work duds.

02:45.577 --> 02:48.136
You can't possibly be serious, Applejack!

02:48.137 --> 02:50.685
You absolutely must wear formal attire.

02:53.044 --> 02:54.061
Nah.

02:54.062 --> 02:59.124
What if I just spruce up your...
duds for you a little bit?

03:00.099 --> 03:02.888
Okay, sure. Why not?
Since you're up for it and all.

03:02.889 --> 03:05.981
Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.

03:05.982 --> 03:06.744
Deal!

03:06.745 --> 03:08.484
Look out below!

03:12.883 --> 03:15.619
Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.

03:19.182 --> 03:21.059
Idea!

03:21.272 --> 03:24.782
I'll make you an outfit for
the Gala too, Rainbow Dash.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.478
Outfit for the what now?

03:28.785 --> 03:31.669
I'll make one for you and you and all of you.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.960
Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too.

03:33.961 --> 03:37.338
Oh, and when I'm done, we can
hold our very own fashion show!

03:37.590 --> 03:40.760
What a great idea!
If you're sure you can handle it.

03:40.932 --> 03:45.117
Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it
will be a wonderful boost for my business.

03:45.118 --> 03:46.667
Plus, fun!

03:46.668 --> 03:48.550
Oh, I love fun things!

03:48.808 --> 03:53.544
Then it's settled.
We'll have a fashion show starring us.

03:56.483 --> 04:01.320
So all you have to do is make a
different, stunnin', original...

04:01.321 --> 04:06.235
...amazin' outfit for one, two, three, four,
five... plus yourself, six ponies?

04:06.236 --> 04:07.732
And lickety split?

04:07.733 --> 04:10.360
Oh, Applejack.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.475
You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.

04:17.920 --> 04:21.602
<i>Thread by thread, stitching it together</i>

04:21.868 --> 04:25.642
<i>Twilight's dress
Cutting out the pattern snip by snip</i>

04:25.643 --> 04:27.868
<i>Making sure the fabric folds nicely</i>

04:27.869 --> 04:29.806
<i>It's the perfect color and so hip</i>

04:29.807 --> 04:31.961
<i>Always gotta keep in mind my pacing</i>

04:31.962 --> 04:34.110
<i>Making sure the cloth's correctly facing</i>

04:34.111 --> 04:39.530
<i>I'm stitching Twilight's dress</i>

04:40.651 --> 04:44.615
<i>Yard by yard, fussing on the details</i>

04:44.616 --> 04:48.276
<i>Jewel neckline
Don't you know a stitch in time saves nine?</i>

04:48.277 --> 04:50.683
<i>Make her something perfect to inspire</i>

04:50.684 --> 04:52.455
<i>Even though she hates formal attire</i>

04:52.456 --> 04:54.528
<i>Gotta mind those intimate details</i>

04:54.529 --> 04:56.770
<i>Even though she's more concerned with sales</i>

04:56.771 --> 05:02.169
<i>It's Applejack's new dress</i>

05:03.506 --> 05:07.434
<i>Dressmaking's easy
For Pinkie Pie something pink</i>

05:07.435 --> 05:09.491
<i>Fluttershy something breezy</i>

05:09.492 --> 05:12.204
<i>Blend color and form...</i>
Do you think it looks cheesy?

05:15.826 --> 05:19.530
<i>Something brash, perhaps quite fetching</i>

05:20.045 --> 05:23.566
<i>Hook and eye
Couldn't you just simply die?</i>

05:23.606 --> 05:25.754
<i>Making sure it fits forelock and crest</i>

05:25.755 --> 05:27.807
<i>Don't forget some magic in the dress</i>

05:27.808 --> 05:29.920
<i>Even though it rides high on the flank</i>

05:29.921 --> 05:31.908
<i>Rainbow won't look like a tank</i>

05:31.909 --> 05:38.249
<i>I'm stitching Rainbow's dress</i>

05:39.053 --> 05:40.934
<i>Piece by piece, snip by snip</i>

05:40.935 --> 05:43.011
<i>Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip</i>

05:43.012 --> 05:45.191
<i>Thread by thread, primmed and pressed</i>

05:45.192 --> 05:47.218
<i>Yard by yard, never stressed</i>

05:47.219 --> 05:54.644
<i>And that's the Art of the Dress!</i>

05:58.236 --> 06:00.677
That's it. Keep them closed.

06:00.755 --> 06:02.236
Don't look.

06:03.448 --> 06:05.008
Okay, you can look now!

06:06.476 --> 06:08.598
These are your new outfits.

06:10.106 --> 06:14.516
What do you think of your old duds now,
Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not?

06:15.194 --> 06:17.401
And Twilight! I made this dress for you...

06:17.402 --> 06:22.149
...and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly
reflect each pony's unique personality.

06:22.954 --> 06:26.631
Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right
on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it.

06:26.632 --> 06:29.340
Oh, and it turned out
BEAUTIFUL, don't you think?

06:29.615 --> 06:34.045
Ooo, and I know you are going to love
yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring!

06:34.301 --> 06:38.076
And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite!

06:38.216 --> 06:40.648
Aren't they all amazing?

06:48.252 --> 06:49.259
Wow...

06:49.260 --> 06:51.524
-They're...
-Yeah, they're...

06:51.525 --> 06:53.496
They sure are...

06:53.497 --> 06:55.655
-...sumth'n.
-Yes! Something.

06:55.656 --> 06:58.831
I love something! Something is my favorite!

06:58.832 --> 07:00.708
It's... nice.

07:00.723 --> 07:02.987
But what's the matter? Don't you like them?

07:02.988 --> 07:04.491
They're very nice...

07:04.492 --> 07:07.961
And we're plum grateful, cause
you worked so hard on them.

07:07.962 --> 07:10.338
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.

07:12.639 --> 07:13.849
She asked.

07:13.981 --> 07:18.241
I guess what we're all saying is that
they're just not what we had in mind.

07:21.235 --> 07:23.886
That's okay. Not a problem.

07:23.887 --> 07:25.641
There's plenty more where that came from.

07:26.230 --> 07:27.884
They were only a first pass.

07:27.885 --> 07:31.664
You're my friends and I want
you to be 110% satisfied.

07:32.191 --> 07:34.443
Not to worry, I'll redo them.

07:34.647 --> 07:38.174
Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that.
They're fine.

07:38.204 --> 07:40.498
I want them to be better that just fine.

07:40.499 --> 07:43.549
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.

07:43.649 --> 07:46.455
Are you sure?
I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose.

07:46.456 --> 07:50.205
Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist.

07:51.740 --> 07:54.633
Well, in that case... Thank you again, Rarity.

07:59.671 --> 08:02.322
What have I gotten myself into?

08:07.853 --> 08:08.858
Hello?

08:08.859 --> 08:10.839
You wanted to see me, Rarity?

08:10.951 --> 08:13.641
Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready.

08:13.642 --> 08:16.642
I completely revised it and
I know you're going to love it.

08:17.441 --> 08:18.715
What do you think?

08:20.649 --> 08:21.769
I...

08:22.265 --> 08:23.093
...love it.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.214
Oh, you're just saying that.

08:25.215 --> 08:27.121
No, no. I do.

08:27.122 --> 08:28.999
It's... nice.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.296
"Nice"?

08:30.297 --> 08:31.232
Nice.

08:31.421 --> 08:33.331
If you don't like it, you should just tell me.

08:33.626 --> 08:35.910
Oh, but I do like it.

08:36.154 --> 08:37.606
Like it or love it?

08:37.607 --> 08:39.200
Um... both?

08:39.201 --> 08:40.089
Which is it?

08:40.090 --> 08:42.132
Please stop asking me this, I...

08:42.133 --> 08:43.819
Well, just tell me what you really think.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.000
No, that's okay...

08:45.001 --> 08:45.976
Tell me.

08:45.977 --> 08:47.625
No... it's fine...

08:47.626 --> 08:48.509
Tell me!

08:48.510 --> 08:50.215
I... like it...

08:50.216 --> 08:52.520
Tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!

08:52.642 --> 08:55.500
All right! Since you really wanna know...

08:57.017 --> 08:59.444
The armscye's tight, the middy collar
doesn't go with the shawl lapel...

08:59.445 --> 09:03.013
...the hems are clearly machine-stitched,
the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile...

09:03.014 --> 09:06.764
...you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a
topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch...

09:06.765 --> 09:10.586
...and the overdesign is reminiscent of
prêt-à-porter and not true French haute couture.

09:12.467 --> 09:16.305
But, uh... you know...
um, whatever you want to do is fine.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.733
Now, the stars on my belt need
to be technically accurate.

09:21.734 --> 09:24.929
Orion has three stars on his belt, not four.

09:26.054 --> 09:29.710
<i>Stitch by stitch, stitching it together</i>

09:30.081 --> 09:33.707
<i>Deadline looms
Don't know the client's always right?</i>

09:33.708 --> 09:35.818
<i>Even if my fabric choice was perfect</i>

09:35.819 --> 09:37.771
<i>Got to get them all done by tonight</i>

09:37.772 --> 09:39.950
<i>Pinkie Pie, the color's too obtrusive</i>

09:39.951 --> 09:41.892
<i>Wait until you see it in the light</i>

09:41.893 --> 09:46.184
<i>I'm sewing them together!</i>

09:46.185 --> 09:49.125
Don't you think my gown would be
more "me" with some lollipops?

09:49.126 --> 09:50.799
-Well, I think...
-Balloons?

09:50.800 --> 09:52.622
-Well...
-DO EET!

09:52.623 --> 09:56.179
<i>Hour by hour, one more change</i>

09:56.180 --> 10:00.275
<i>I'm sewing them together, take great pains</i>

10:00.865 --> 10:02.935
<i>Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind</i>

10:02.936 --> 10:05.115
<i>Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind?</i>

10:05.116 --> 10:07.157
<i>Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time</i>

10:07.158 --> 10:12.693
<i>Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine</i>

10:12.769 --> 10:16.736
<i>Dressmaking's easy
Every customer's call</i>

10:16.793 --> 10:18.743
<i>Brings a whole new revision</i>

10:18.744 --> 10:21.548
<i>Have to pick up the pace
Still hold to my vision</i>

10:22.253 --> 10:26.127
That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.229
French haute couture, please.

10:32.410 --> 10:35.366
What if it rains? Galoshes!

10:36.038 --> 10:38.283
More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons.

10:38.755 --> 10:40.734
More candy! Oh, less candy.

10:40.735 --> 10:42.873
Oh wait, I know. Streamers!

10:42.874 --> 10:45.966
-Streamers?
-Whose dress is this?

10:45.967 --> 10:47.802
Streamers it is.

10:51.436 --> 10:52.124
What?

10:52.125 --> 10:54.109
Aren't you going to tell me
to change something too?

10:54.336 --> 10:56.991
No, I just want my dress to be cool.

10:57.149 --> 10:58.462
Do you not like the color?

10:58.463 --> 11:01.276
The color's fine, just make it look cooler.

11:01.277 --> 11:02.319
Do you not like the shape?

11:02.320 --> 11:05.992
The shape's fine, just make
the whole thing... you know, cooler.

11:06.412 --> 11:08.752
It needs to be about 20% cooler.

11:10.055 --> 11:12.115
<i>All we ever want is indecision</i>

11:12.116 --> 11:14.067
<i>All we really like is what we know</i>

11:14.068 --> 11:16.129
<i>Gotta balance style with adherence</i>

11:16.130 --> 11:18.029
<i>Making sure we make a good appearance</i>

11:18.030 --> 11:20.062
<i>Even if you simply have to fudge it</i>

11:20.063 --> 11:22.094
<i>Make sure that it stays within our budget</i>

11:22.095 --> 11:24.291
<i>Got to overcome intimidation</i>

11:24.292 --> 11:28.413
<i>Remember, it's all in the presentation!</i>

11:29.242 --> 11:31.042
<i>Piece by piece, snip by snip</i>

11:31.043 --> 11:33.089
<i>Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip</i>

11:33.090 --> 11:35.220
<i>Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed</i>

11:35.221 --> 11:37.236
<i>Yard by yard, always stressed</i>

11:37.237 --> 11:43.284
<i>And that's the Art of the Dress!</i>

11:47.406 --> 11:51.573
Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest
dresses I've ever made.

11:55.522 --> 11:59.218
Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.455
Now don't hold back.

12:00.456 --> 12:02.390
Let me know what you really think.

12:02.714 --> 12:05.892
-Oh my!
-It's... perfect!
-It's cool!

12:05.893 --> 12:08.989
Wow. They're the best duds I ever did see.

12:08.990 --> 12:11.939
It's exactly what I asked for!

12:13.705 --> 12:15.107
Thank you, Rarity.

12:15.587 --> 12:16.881
Are you as happy with the as we're?

12:18.218 --> 12:21.754
Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy.

12:22.054 --> 12:24.356
I'm just relieved to finally be done.

12:27.002 --> 12:28.727
You are never gonna believe this!

12:28.728 --> 12:30.096
You've heard of Hoity-Toity?

12:30.328 --> 12:32.639
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?

12:32.640 --> 12:35.166
Uh-huh. He heard about your fashion show.

12:35.167 --> 12:37.003
Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him...

12:37.004 --> 12:40.836
He's coming here all the way from
Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!

12:41.387 --> 12:42.819
Whoa, Nelly!

12:42.919 --> 12:45.167
You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy.

12:45.267 --> 12:47.152
You business will be boomin'!

12:50.443 --> 12:53.076
Hoity-Toity?
He's coming here?

12:53.077 --> 12:55.709
To see THESE dresses?

12:55.849 --> 12:59.549
Yep! Get ready for all
of your dreams to come true.

13:10.632 --> 13:11.531
There he is!

13:25.610 --> 13:27.309
Okay. Relax, Rarity.

13:27.310 --> 13:30.272
Your friends like their outfits and so will he.

13:31.672 --> 13:32.796
What's wrong with the lights?!

13:33.453 --> 13:36.497
Oh, yes. That means the show's starting. Good.

13:46.042 --> 13:51.524
Since the beginning of time the elite
of Equestria have longed for pony fashions...

13:51.525 --> 13:56.033
...that that truly expressed the
essence of their very souls.

13:56.461 --> 14:01.688
Patiently waiting decades... no, centuries!
...for the perfect pony gown.

14:02.192 --> 14:05.974
Today at long last, Equestria, your wait is over!

14:06.426 --> 14:10.891
Let's hear it for the breathtaking
designs of Ponyville's own...

14:11.124 --> 14:12.244
Rarity!

14:33.991 --> 14:36.373
Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?

14:40.126 --> 14:40.838
Oh dear.

14:41.311 --> 14:43.083
You think we overdid it?

14:43.292 --> 14:44.412
Nah.

14:47.521 --> 14:49.105
Okay, maybe a little.

14:49.275 --> 14:54.735
Oh, those amateurish designs look like a piled-on
mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink!

14:58.891 --> 15:00.936
It's a travesty, it's what it is.

15:00.937 --> 15:04.931
Those outfits are the ugliest things
I've ever seen, oh for shame.

15:05.031 --> 15:08.714
Who is responsible for subjecting
our eyes to these horrors?

15:08.715 --> 15:11.275
Not to mention wasting my valuable time.

15:12.456 --> 15:13.122
Hide me.

15:14.498 --> 15:17.762
Come on out and take a bow, Rarity.
You worked really hard for this.

15:17.909 --> 15:20.273
Yes! Alright, woohoo! Go, Rarity!

15:33.065 --> 15:35.052
Rarity? You okay in there?

15:35.142 --> 15:36.969
You haven't come out for days.

15:36.970 --> 15:41.889
I'm never coming out! I can't
show my face in Ponyville ever again!

15:42.281 --> 15:45.514
I used to be somepony. I used to be respected.

15:45.515 --> 15:48.526
I made dresses. Beautiful, beautiful dresses!

15:48.527 --> 15:51.612
But now everypony is laughing at me.

15:51.613 --> 15:53.721
I'm nothing but a laughingstock!

15:56.282 --> 15:58.219
You're not a laughingstock, Rarity...

15:58.220 --> 15:59.869
-She kind of is.
-Shhh!

16:00.063 --> 16:01.496
Come on out and talk to us.

16:01.974 --> 16:05.454
Leave me alone!

16:05.455 --> 16:09.374
I vant to be alone! I want to wallow in...

16:09.574 --> 16:11.929
...whatever it is that ponies
are supposed to wallow in!

16:11.942 --> 16:13.495
Do ponies wallow in pity?

16:13.496 --> 16:17.751
Oh, listen to me, I don't even know
what I'm supposed to wallow in!

16:17.752 --> 16:21.019
I'M SO PATHETIC!

16:22.059 --> 16:23.404
Now what do we do?

16:24.404 --> 16:25.363
Panic?

16:25.364 --> 16:26.770
That's your answer for everything!

16:26.771 --> 16:29.009
Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this.

16:29.010 --> 16:31.176
She'll become a crazy cat lady!

16:31.177 --> 16:32.714
She only has one cat.

16:32.814 --> 16:34.176
Give her time...

16:41.175 --> 16:42.267
Exile...

16:42.667 --> 16:46.280
I guess technically I'd have to
move away to live in exile.

16:46.660 --> 16:48.757
Where would I go? And what would I pack?

16:48.758 --> 16:51.319
Oh, it's going to take me forever
to do all of that packing.

16:51.606 --> 16:53.751
What are you supposed to pack
when you go into exile?

16:54.007 --> 16:55.631
Are you supposed to pack warm?

16:56.661 --> 16:57.781
Opal?

17:03.875 --> 17:05.519
Opal, how did you get up there?

17:05.520 --> 17:07.906
Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming!

17:11.975 --> 17:13.324
Rainbow Dash?!

17:13.424 --> 17:16.450
How dare you strand my poor Opal on the tree.

17:16.451 --> 17:19.710
Well, how else were we gonna get
you out here to show you...

17:19.711 --> 17:21.111
...this!

17:22.472 --> 17:25.331
What is it? It's not... You...

17:26.492 --> 17:28.877
We all finished your dress for you.

17:28.878 --> 17:31.756
Thanks to Fluttershy's
freaky knowledge of sewing.

17:32.617 --> 17:34.038
Do you like it?

17:34.239 --> 17:35.206
Like it?

17:37.776 --> 17:38.795
Like it?!

17:39.028 --> 17:41.225
Uh-uh. She doesn't like it.

17:41.383 --> 17:43.634
No, I don't like it.

17:46.245 --> 17:47.883
I LOVE IT!

17:49.733 --> 17:54.380
You ponies did an amazing job.
It's exactly the way I imagined it.

17:54.606 --> 17:57.154
We just followed your brilliant design.

17:57.513 --> 17:59.997
Like we should have let you do for our outfits.

18:00.132 --> 18:02.976
Those first dressed you designed were perfect.

18:03.327 --> 18:05.641
We're so super sorry.

18:06.051 --> 18:10.089
You worked really hard to make our
dresses exactly the way we wanted them.

18:10.489 --> 18:12.567
We all saw how well that turned out.

18:12.767 --> 18:14.771
Oh, I forgive you.

18:15.271 --> 18:17.020
Well, that's mighty big of you.

18:17.021 --> 18:20.488
But my whole career is still ruined!

18:20.688 --> 18:22.971
Oh, right. That.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.589
Maybe not.

18:25.590 --> 18:28.134
All right, I haven't got all day.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.165
Take two.

18:55.638 --> 18:56.722
Hello...

18:56.723 --> 18:58.846
Oh, this can't be the same designer.

19:11.449 --> 19:13.707
Simply magnificent!

19:13.807 --> 19:16.782
And suddenly I have a fresh craving
for some Dutch apple pie...

19:16.783 --> 19:19.789
Candied apples on a stick?
Apple turnovers? Apple cobbler?

19:37.049 --> 19:38.349
Brilliant!

19:52.966 --> 19:55.558
Oh, spectacular!

20:09.329 --> 20:11.872
Now this is a fashion show.

20:11.873 --> 20:15.275
All of these dresses are absolutely amazing.

20:15.887 --> 20:19.461
Who is responsible?
Step forward, show yourself!

20:25.857 --> 20:27.771
Bravo! Bravo!

20:27.772 --> 20:29.692
Magnifico! Encore!

20:31.103 --> 20:33.577
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

20:33.578 --> 20:36.158
Oh, thank you so much!

20:37.172 --> 20:38.939
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:38.940 --> 20:41.603
"This week my very talented
friend Rarity learned..."

20:41.604 --> 20:45.910
"...that if you try to please everypony,
you oftentimes end up pleasing nopony."

20:45.911 --> 20:47.506
"Especially yourself."

20:47.706 --> 20:49.304
"And I learned this:"

20:49.573 --> 20:52.107
"When somepony offers to do you a favor..."

20:52.108 --> 20:54.434
"...like making you a beautiful dress..."

20:54.435 --> 20:58.005
"...you shouldn't be overly critical
of something generously given to you."

20:58.006 --> 21:01.481
"In other words, you shouldn't
look a gift horse in the mouth."

21:07.936 --> 21:13.373
Rarity, my congratulations.
You are the most impressive fashion maven.

21:13.374 --> 21:18.311
Would you do me the great honor
of allowing me to feature your couture...

21:18.312 --> 21:21.510
...in my best of the best boutique in Canterlot?

21:23.061 --> 21:27.258
Now, I'll need you to make a dozen
of each dress for me by next Tuesday.

21:31.258 --> 21:34.758
