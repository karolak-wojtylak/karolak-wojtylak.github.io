WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:05.204
I do appreciate you
showing me the way

00:05.306 --> 00:07.139
to the phoenix's
nests, Spike.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.974
Anything for you, Rarity.

00:09.076 --> 00:11.310
Besides, I've been
meaning to visit Pee Wee.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.646
He really was an
excellent pet.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.815
I can't imagine why
you set him free.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.319
Phoenixes aren't meant
to be domesticated.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.654
Even in the wild, they
like to keep to themselves.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.358
Well, they are beautiful.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.795
A few of their feathers will add
just the right splash of color

00:29.897 --> 00:30.446
to my latest...

00:30.547 --> 00:32.296
Spike! What are you doing?

00:32.399 --> 00:33.499
Agh! Nothing.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.235
Is there something
wrong with your face?

00:38.305 --> 00:39.971
It's a stone scale.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.373
It isn't magical
or anything

00:41.475 --> 00:43.008
like the call of
the Dragon Lord.

00:43.310 --> 00:47.513
It's just red and
itchy and embarrassing.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.517
Ooooh, precious pants.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.653
That does look
uncomfortable.

00:55.255 --> 00:58.423
But even I get the odd
blemish from time to time;

00:58.525 --> 01:00.292
it's nothing to
be embarrassed by.

01:03.196 --> 01:05.430
You could pay
Zecora a visit.

01:05.532 --> 01:07.599
She makes a cream
that works wonders.

01:08.101 --> 01:09.701
Just don't get
the shampoo.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.738
There's Pee Wee's parents!

01:14.508 --> 01:16.041
But I don't see Pee Wee.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.643
Maybe he moved out.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.778
Everypony has to leave
the nest at some point.

01:22.182 --> 01:23.048
Pee Wee!

01:29.189 --> 01:29.788
OUCH!

01:34.728 --> 01:37.863
Perhaps you should pay Zecora a
visit sooner rather than later.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.899
[sigh] I don't want
anypony else to see this.

01:41.001 --> 01:45.304
Besides, I'm sure it'll clear
up after a good night's sleep.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.513
I can't believe
you're still asleep.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.950
Ugh. Just five more minutes.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.688
It's nearly noon and
you promised to help me

02:02.790 --> 02:04.656
with my lecture
for class today.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.726
Noon? Whoa. I slept like a rock.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.261
Which reminds me,
all that sleep

02:09.363 --> 02:10.762
probably cleared up
my stone scale!

02:10.883 --> 02:16.101
[gasp] Um. On second thought, you can
go back to sleep if you want.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.505
Aaaaaaaaah!

03:00.514 --> 03:02.314
Spike, what
are you doing?

03:02.416 --> 03:04.816
Hiding. From my
hideous face!

03:05.018 --> 03:07.919
I'm sure it feels terrible,
but it's just a breakout.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.288
It's not the end of the world.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.157
That's easy for you to say.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.725
Your face isn't covered
in itchy red spots.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.462
I used to get
terrible break outs,

03:17.564 --> 03:20.166
anytime I had a final
exam with Celestia,

03:21.068 --> 03:23.568
who probably never had a
blemish her whole life.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.805
Well, I'm not in
magic school.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.574
No, but these things
can be stress-related,

03:29.676 --> 03:32.077
and you did spend
yesterday with Rarity.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.480
Heh! What could possibly
be stressful about that?

03:36.717 --> 03:37.949
You could try Zecora.

03:38.051 --> 03:38.884
She makes a
cream that--

03:38.985 --> 03:40.818
--works wonders.
I've heard.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.590
But I'm not
leaving the castle

03:44.691 --> 03:46.757
until my face is back
to its adorable self.

03:48.947 --> 03:52.031
Fine. But you're still gonna help
me practice my lecture.

03:54.467 --> 03:58.437
Ahem. The element of generosity
and its importance in relation

03:58.539 --> 04:00.105
to the other
Elements of Harmony-

04:05.078 --> 04:06.245
My lecture!

04:07.047 --> 04:08.247
I don't know
what happened.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.915
I just had a
sudden case of--

04:14.488 --> 04:15.421
...indigestion.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.289
I'm so sorry!

04:17.991 --> 04:19.691
Oooh. That's OK.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.194
I'm sure I can rewrite
the lecture from my notes.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.196
I have a lot.

04:24.898 --> 04:25.997
I can help you with...

04:26.799 --> 04:29.034
Maybe you should leave
the castle after all

04:29.136 --> 04:31.837
and go somewhere
less... flammable?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.881
Hey there, not handsome.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.916
Rarity: Oh, Spiiiike!

04:48.388 --> 04:51.156
My, what a fetching ensemble
you've put together.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.824
Very noir-esque.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.994
[giggle] I believe Shadow Spade
herself would approve.

04:56.896 --> 04:57.864
Uh... thanks.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.666
But I wonder if you wouldn't
mind taking it off.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.733
What? Oh, I, uh...I..

05:05.006 --> 05:06.940
Sorry? You'll have to speak up;

05:07.241 --> 05:09.575
my ears are a little bit
clogged, or something.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.943
It's just that I absolutely
must have a model

05:12.045 --> 05:15.514
for my phoenix feather dress and
nopony else is available.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.582
Sorry, Rarity, but I...

05:17.684 --> 05:22.687
I am super busy all day
giving... tours of the school.

05:22.989 --> 05:23.789
Pinkie Pie: Really?

05:24.591 --> 05:26.591
I thought I was
giving tours today.

05:26.693 --> 05:27.392
Guess not.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.193
Free day!

05:28.295 --> 05:29.628
Whee! Whoo hoo!

05:34.835 --> 05:35.934
Class rooms are that way.

05:36.036 --> 05:36.969
Dorms are that way.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.603
Twilight's office is up there.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.038
This is a fountain.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.242
Uh. Could you slow down a bit?

05:43.644 --> 05:46.111
We've come a long way
to see the school.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.313
I-I don't wanna
miss anything.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.781
Oh. Um, yeah.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.418
Sorry.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.853
Is something wrong?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.989
What? Why? No!

05:58.691 --> 06:02.561
D-Do all the dragons at this
school suffer from scale issues?

06:02.763 --> 06:03.628
[very hoarse] I don't know.

06:04.831 --> 06:05.597
What?

06:05.899 --> 06:08.000
[strained] I
don't know.

06:08.502 --> 06:12.337
I-I'm sorry, did you
say "fireworks show"?

06:12.939 --> 06:15.540
I said..
[shouting] I DON'T KNOW.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.423
[shouting] THIS IS THE
SCHOOL LIBRARY!

06:31.525 --> 06:34.926
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SERENE
SPOTS ON CAMPUS WHERE STUDENTS

06:35.028 --> 06:37.896
CAN SPEND TIME IN QUIET
REFLECTION OR STUDY.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.265
WHAT!

06:41.067 --> 06:43.134
Could you please stop shouting?

06:43.236 --> 06:46.238
We're trying to do our homework
and it's kind of distracting.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.273
WAS I SHOUTING?

06:51.545 --> 06:54.245
Ahem. I have no idea what
you're talking-

07:11.999 --> 07:13.398
If you're
trying to hide,

07:13.500 --> 07:15.200
you need to
do a better job.

07:15.302 --> 07:18.003
All I had to do was
follow the smoke.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.374
[hoarse] Leave me alone.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.575
What?

07:24.077 --> 07:27.713
Leave... me... alone.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.614
I can't under-

07:29.716 --> 07:32.084
Was that, "sleeves
made of foam"?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.620
I said leave ME ALONE.

07:42.680 --> 07:46.898
Wow! I have seen some pretty
bad molts in my time,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.468
but yours takes the cake.

07:50.070 --> 07:50.802
Molts?

07:51.404 --> 07:52.321
The molt?

07:52.422 --> 07:55.839
Super painful stone
scales, fire burps,

07:55.942 --> 07:58.143
uncontrollable volume shifts?

07:58.345 --> 08:00.078
It's all part of
growing up dragon.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.112
Congrats!

08:02.048 --> 08:02.848
Agh!

08:03.150 --> 08:04.783
Oh. Sorry.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.658
No, no, no, no, no! The
last time I grew up,

08:13.760 --> 08:15.827
I turned into a giant,
greedy monster!

08:16.963 --> 08:20.130
Greed-induced bigness.
That's totally different.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.168
The molt is completely normal.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.003
Every dragon goes through it.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.706
Pretty soon you'll leave
and strike out on your own.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.092
Why would I
do that?

08:29.193 --> 08:32.377
Have you been living with
ponies your whole life?

08:32.879 --> 08:33.778
Uh huh.

08:34.080 --> 08:34.830
Oh.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.781
Well, in the Dragonlands,
a molter's loved ones

08:37.884 --> 08:40.151
kicks them out at the
first stone scale.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.353
What? Why?

08:41.955 --> 08:44.155
I think it's biological.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.358
We call it the "Molt Effect".

08:46.460 --> 08:49.260
I haven't even told
you about the smell.

08:49.462 --> 08:50.128
Smell?

08:50.931 --> 08:51.562
Agh!

08:51.682 --> 08:54.499
Yeah. I mean, I loved my
brother and all,

08:54.601 --> 08:57.702
but one whiff and I
was all, "See ya!"

08:59.339 --> 09:00.839
Speaking of which...

09:01.041 --> 09:01.641
Wait!

09:02.142 --> 09:04.142
Does the Molt Effect
happen to ponies, too?

09:04.828 --> 09:07.411
Twilight already asked me
to leave the castle today.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.414
If she kicks me out,
where am I going to live?

09:09.516 --> 09:11.016
I'm too young to grow up!

09:11.518 --> 09:14.953
I'm sure you'll find a nice
hoard of gems to guard

09:15.055 --> 09:16.955
or a village to terrorize,

09:17.257 --> 09:19.224
though now that dragons
and ponies are friends,

09:19.326 --> 09:20.959
I guess that's
off the table.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.129
So no creature is gonna
want to be around me?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.730
Oh, I didn't say that.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.365
That molt stench
is a magnet for

09:27.467 --> 09:30.469
predators, Tatzlwurms,
Hydras, Rocs.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.037
Dragons are scared of rocks?

09:33.339 --> 09:36.408
R-O-C-S. Rocs.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.543
Humongous birds of
prey that can snack

09:38.645 --> 09:40.780
on a molting
dragon like candy.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.182
[hoarse] So, Twilight's kicking
me out and the only creatures

09:44.284 --> 09:46.885
who don't find me disgusting
want to eat me?

09:47.487 --> 09:49.220
Seriously, I heard
none of that.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.656
TWILIGHT'S KICKING ME OUT
AND THE ONLY CREATURES

09:51.758 --> 09:54.526
WHO DON'T FIND ME
DISGUSTING WANT TO EAT ME?

09:54.828 --> 09:55.894
CONGRATS!

09:56.963 --> 09:59.464
HEY! IS THIS THE
SHOUTING CLOSET?

09:59.566 --> 10:01.065
BECAUSE I'VE
GOT A FREE DAY

10:01.167 --> 10:03.702
AND I AM TOTALLY UP
FOR SOME SHOUTING!

10:06.205 --> 10:08.305
Also, where is that brussels
sprouts covered in cotton candy

10:08.408 --> 10:09.542
smell coming from?

10:09.643 --> 10:12.477
Because it is
really interesting...

10:17.784 --> 10:19.384
I didn't know where else to go.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.685
I can't take the chance that
Twilight will kick me out.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.688
You aren't feeling any
molt effects, are you?

10:26.043 --> 10:29.494
<i> When it comes to break outs,</i>
<i> I've seen all circumstances.</i>

10:29.796 --> 10:36.067
<i> But as for the molt smell,</i>
<i> let's not take any chances.</i>

10:40.874 --> 10:42.974
Is there anything you
can do to cure me?

10:43.176 --> 10:45.744
<i> The ailments you have</i>
<i> aren't something to cure.</i>

10:45.846 --> 10:48.914
<i> The molt's a condition</i>
<i> that dragons endure.</i>

10:49.916 --> 10:52.417
But if anypony sees,
or smells me right now,

10:52.519 --> 10:54.820
they'll be so grossed out,
they'll avoid me forever!

10:55.422 --> 10:58.656
<i> Perhaps we can lessen</i>
<i> this strange molt-effect,</i>

10:58.758 --> 11:01.893
<i> The smell is the most</i>
<i> likely cause I suspect.</i>

11:02.095 --> 11:04.196
[quiet] It's all so
embarrassing.

11:04.798 --> 11:08.233
<i> I know you are speaking</i>
<i> but I can't hear a thing.</i>

11:08.335 --> 11:11.136
<i> Are you talking about</i>
<i> teaching asparagus to sing?</i>

11:11.538 --> 11:14.005
I said it's EMBARRASSING.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.545
<i> If the goal is to not have</i>
<i> your friends all depart,</i>

11:20.647 --> 11:23.581
<i> Perhaps your volume is</i>
<i> where we should start.</i>

11:24.283 --> 11:25.415
[stomach rumbling]
Oh, no...

11:31.325 --> 11:35.159
Rarity: Zecora?
Hello? Are you there?

11:35.461 --> 11:37.662
I CAN'T LET RARITY
SEE ME LIKE THIS.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.564
PLEASE DON'T LET
HER KNOW I'M HERE.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.570
OH, DEAR.

11:44.671 --> 11:48.005
I'M TALKING EVEN LOUDER
THAN I THOUGHT, AREN'T I?

11:48.508 --> 11:51.342
<i> I have volume concerns</i>
<i> today by the scores,</i>

11:51.444 --> 11:54.212
<i> but it seems that I'm ready</i>
<i> to help you with yours.</i>

11:54.314 --> 11:58.849
ER. I'M SORRY? I CAN'T SEEM
TO HEAR ANYTHING.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.754
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD HELP.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.690
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED.

12:05.792 --> 12:09.494
ONE MINUTE I WAS SEWING
PHOENIX FEATHERS ONTO A DRESS

12:09.696 --> 12:12.931
AND THE NEXT, I COULDN'T
HEAR MY OWN VOICE.

12:13.433 --> 12:17.535
<i> Ah, the feathers of that bird</i>
<i> can affect pony's ears.</i>

12:17.637 --> 12:21.039
<i> It's a magic ailment</i>
<i> I've treated for years.</i>

12:21.541 --> 12:22.874
I ONLY KNOW YOU'RE TALKING

12:22.976 --> 12:25.143
BECAUSE YOUR MOUTH IS
GOING UP AND DOWN.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.815
Agh! Oh, goodness!

12:30.917 --> 12:32.750
I hope that incredibly
pungent odor

12:32.852 --> 12:35.220
belongs to some sort
of magical curative!

12:36.322 --> 12:40.825
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT BUSY, BUT
I MUST HAVE MY HEARING BACK.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.761
IT TURNS OUT THAT I TALK
TO MYSELF WHILE I SEW

12:43.863 --> 12:47.232
AND WITHOUT THAT CONVERSATION,
I SIMPLY CAN'T THINK!

12:47.834 --> 12:51.102
<i> It's a simple cure and</i>
<i> the directions are clear,</i>

12:51.204 --> 12:55.139
<i> just one or two drops</i>
<i> in each of your ears.</i>

12:55.442 --> 12:58.275
Ah! Oh, thank you!
You're an ear saver.

12:58.429 --> 13:02.980
OH! AND WHILE I AM HERE, DO
YOU HAVE ANY BLEMISH CREAM?

13:03.383 --> 13:06.017
SPIKE IS HAVING
SOME SCALE ISSUES.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.653
Spike: YOU
HAVE NO IDEA.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.323
Ooo! I think I heard something.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.893
YOUR CURE IS WORKING ALREADY!

13:15.795 --> 13:18.563
<i> The cream that you</i>
<i> want is just over here,</i>

13:18.865 --> 13:23.135
<i> It's a popular potion for</i>
<i> all creatures this year.</i>

13:23.837 --> 13:25.203
Ah, thank you, Zecora.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.511
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,

13:33.613 --> 13:37.582
BUT I DO THINK YOUR HUT
COULD USE AN AIRING OUT.

13:39.719 --> 13:44.822
<i> Rarity's gone, there's</i>
<i> no need to hide,</i>

13:44.924 --> 13:46.525
[sniff] Agh!

13:47.727 --> 13:51.330
<i> Though I wonder if we</i>
<i> should continue outside?</i>

13:52.532 --> 13:55.033
<i> Can't treat your symptoms</i>
<i> down there on the ground.</i>

13:55.135 --> 13:58.036
<i> It's safe to come out,</i>
<i> there's no ponies around.</i>

13:58.138 --> 13:59.670
I'm not hiding from ponies.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.706
I'm hiding from THAT!

14:14.170 --> 14:16.787
Did I forget to mention the
molt smell attracts predators?

14:16.990 --> 14:19.524
<i> That's something that would</i>
<i> have been quite nice to know,</i>

14:19.626 --> 14:22.760
<i> But it's not worth discussing</i>
<i> right now, we should go!</i>

14:32.038 --> 14:33.204
It's only after me!

14:33.405 --> 14:34.871
I'll lead it away
while you get help!

14:37.310 --> 14:38.744
This way birdy, bird!

14:39.946 --> 14:42.280
Molting dragon over here!

14:47.453 --> 14:49.787
OK, maybe this
wasn't a good plan!

14:49.889 --> 14:53.157
<i> You can't hide in a tree,</i>
<i> you have to come down,</i>

14:53.259 --> 14:56.060
<i> We stand a much better</i>
<i> chance on the ground!</i>

14:58.965 --> 14:59.931
ZECORA!

15:00.033 --> 15:01.566
Bring her back!

15:01.968 --> 15:03.101
Agh!

15:09.292 --> 15:11.375
Oh, Spike, what are
you doing here?

15:11.478 --> 15:13.311
Rarity, you have
to get out of here;

15:13.513 --> 15:15.346
there's a giant Roc
trying to eat me.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.647
It's got Zecora!

15:16.849 --> 15:18.015
Yes. What?

15:18.119 --> 15:21.820
I WAS JUST AT ZECORA'S,
BUT I'M HEADING BACK.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.656
I CAN'T READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

15:25.058 --> 15:29.027
DOES THIS SAY TWO DROPS ONCE A
DAY, OR ONE DROP TWICE A DAY?

15:29.729 --> 15:32.597
Rarity, there's no time!
We have to get help!

15:32.799 --> 15:36.201
YES, MY EARS ARE
COMPLETELY CLOGGED!

15:36.703 --> 15:39.504
WHY SPIKE, YOUR STONE
SCALES LOOK WORSE!

15:39.606 --> 15:41.773
OH, HERE, I PICKED
UP JUST THE THING.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.307
I--
[screech]

15:47.313 --> 15:50.915
<i> Oh, I wish you'd escaped</i>
<i> either claw of this bird,</i>

15:51.217 --> 15:54.152
<i> but the both of us trapped</i>
<i> in the same one's absurd!</i>

15:54.921 --> 15:55.720
WHAT?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.924
Let my ponies go!

16:03.896 --> 16:04.595
Whoa!

16:08.868 --> 16:09.467
Agh!

16:14.006 --> 16:15.640
Aaaaaah!

16:21.013 --> 16:22.981
Spike? What are
you doing?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.517
If my stone scales
didn't itch so much

16:26.619 --> 16:28.186
and we weren't in
immediate danger,

16:28.488 --> 16:31.756
this would be really
embarrassing.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.057
Danger?

16:40.767 --> 16:43.768
I was headed to Zecora's to
get some cream for your scales.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.303
I had no idea you were...

16:46.105 --> 16:48.573
About to be eaten by
a giant predator

16:48.675 --> 16:50.141
attracted to my molt smell?

16:50.643 --> 16:51.742
Molt smell?

16:53.279 --> 16:54.679
Rarity screams: Twilight!

16:55.081 --> 16:56.614
Was that Rarity?

16:56.716 --> 16:57.899
And Zecora.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.183
I tried to save them, but it's
all I can do to stop scratching

17:00.286 --> 17:02.754
long enough to dive out of the
way when that bird attacks!

17:08.995 --> 17:11.829
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BEEN IN THE CLUTCHES

17:11.931 --> 17:15.966
OF A HORRIBLE GIANT CREATURE,
BUT IT DOESN'T GET ANY EASIER!

17:25.177 --> 17:27.078
Ah! Finally!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.480
I didn't think that
itching would ever stop.

17:36.088 --> 17:36.987
What's happening?

17:37.089 --> 17:39.123
I can't mo--

17:59.412 --> 18:01.046
What just happened?

18:01.948 --> 18:03.448
Did I just sprout wings?

18:04.350 --> 18:06.684
I JUST SPROUTED WINGS!

18:14.927 --> 18:17.195
[gasp] I've gotta help them!

18:20.967 --> 18:23.300
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa!

18:34.380 --> 18:34.913
Oops!

18:37.650 --> 18:40.217
Spike? How did
you get wings?

18:40.419 --> 18:41.269
I don't know!

18:41.370 --> 18:43.820
But they're pretty
aweso--WHOOOAAHHHH!

18:49.695 --> 18:51.295
Do you think you can
fly up and distract him

18:51.397 --> 18:53.564
while I work on freeing
Zecora and Rarity?

18:59.438 --> 19:00.838
Hey, giant chicken!

19:00.940 --> 19:04.041
If you like dragons so
much, come and get me!

19:13.119 --> 19:14.118
Greetings.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.625
SPIKE!

19:31.404 --> 19:34.438
<i> I know that the molt</i>
<i> produced surprising things,</i>

19:34.540 --> 19:38.510
<i> but I'm glad that the last</i>
<i> was a new pair of wings!</i>

19:39.412 --> 19:42.513
YES, AND ALSO I'M
GLAD YOU'VE GOT WINGS.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.415
This is amazing.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.417
I didn't know if
you'd ever get wings.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.118
I'm so happy for you.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.954
Does it have something
to do with this "molt"

19:50.057 --> 19:51.174
you were talking about?

19:51.775 --> 19:54.592
[sigh] It's what's
been going on with me.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.527
The break out, the fire burps.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.697
The molt is when dragons get
older and start to change.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.767
I wish I could stop
it, but I can't.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.868
I should go.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.405
Go? What are you
talking about?

20:08.207 --> 20:11.375
In the Dragonlands, families
make molters leave home.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.044
It's called the Molt Effect.

20:13.246 --> 20:16.614
Well, this isn't the Dragonlands
and Molt Effect or no,

20:16.916 --> 20:18.950
I don't want you going anywhere.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.918
But I'm growing up.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.887
What if something
even worse happens?

20:23.189 --> 20:26.257
You're supposed to grow up,
but you'll always be you.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.593
And whatever happens, we'll
get through it together.

20:32.865 --> 20:37.334
Woohoo! Yeah! Look at
me! Let's go home!

20:37.536 --> 20:40.771
Uh, I don't need to
carry you anymore, do I?

20:40.873 --> 20:42.039
You have wings.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.091
They are new!

20:43.192 --> 20:44.642
And I don't
wanna overdo it.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.950
I can't believe you thought
any of us would send you away

20:53.052 --> 20:55.586
because of some
silly "Molt Effect".

20:56.488 --> 20:59.523
Ah. Even if the symptoms
were slightly unsettling,

20:59.625 --> 21:02.126
and let's face it, the
odor wasn't pleasant,

21:02.328 --> 21:04.161
nopony would stop
caring for you

21:04.263 --> 21:05.997
just because you
were getting older.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.332
Everypony goes
through changes.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.668
Sometimes change
can be wonderful.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.305
Like being able to model
for any length of dress.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.140
Ah. A bit higher darling, please.

21:17.743 --> 21:20.444
I'm glad to help, Rarity,
but don't you think there's

21:20.546 --> 21:23.514
wonderful things about flying
that don't involve dresses?

21:24.016 --> 21:25.567
Of course, darling.

21:25.668 --> 21:28.519
Flying will also be beneficial
for you to help me with gowns,

21:28.621 --> 21:30.154
frocks, robes, shifts,
skirts, minis, maxis.
