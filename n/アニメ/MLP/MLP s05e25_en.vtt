00:02.060 --> 00:05.940
If somepony had told me when I
was a blank-flank that one day

00:05.940 --> 00:09.440
I'd give a speech to a class
at Celestia's School of Magic,

00:09.780 --> 00:11.770
I wouldn't have believed it.
But...

00:17.920 --> 00:19.820
I hope that I have
been up to the task

00:20.040 --> 00:22.000
because I can tell
that all of you are,

00:22.200 --> 00:24.220
and that the future
of Equestrian magic

00:24.220 --> 00:25.290
is in good hooves.

00:29.320 --> 00:34.140
Wow. That was even better
than the first eleven times!

00:36.860 --> 00:37.940
I don't know, Spike.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.040
I'd like to be able to get
through the whole speech

00:40.040 --> 00:41.460
without looking at the cards.

00:41.620 --> 00:44.480
Come on, Twilight, you can't be
nervous about giving a speech

00:44.480 --> 00:46.140
to a bunch of magic students.

00:46.300 --> 00:49.680
Oh, I'm not nervous, Spike, but
I do have to set a good example,

00:49.900 --> 00:51.560
especially for
magic students.

00:51.820 --> 00:53.440
That's why this
speech has to be...

00:56.300 --> 00:57.320
Perfect?

00:57.640 --> 01:00.900
Exactly. Let's go
through it one more time.

01:01.100 --> 01:01.880
Ahem.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.920
When Princess Celestia asked
me to speak to you today,

01:04.920 --> 01:07.480
I was honored to
have the opportunity

01:07.480 --> 01:10.140
to talk about my favorite
subject - magic.

01:17.740 --> 01:30.220

01:54.040 --> 01:57.180
Obviously the long-term effects
of the simultaneous acquisition

01:57.180 --> 01:59.560
of cutie marks has yet
to be determined, but...

02:02.960 --> 02:04.700
Ahem. Next slide, please.

02:14.740 --> 02:16.660
...I can speak from
my own experience

02:16.660 --> 02:19.500
that the power of cutie
mark magic is very real.

02:19.780 --> 02:21.820
And in the instance
of my friends and I,

02:22.060 --> 02:24.060
it can be traced
to a single event.

02:24.980 --> 02:27.920
Without Rainbow Dash's race
to defend Fluttershy's honor,

02:28.200 --> 02:30.040
this Rainboom wouldn't
have happened.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.340
Fluttershy might never have
discovered her love of animals.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.340
Applejack might
never have realized

02:35.340 --> 02:36.940
that she belonged
on her farm.

02:37.300 --> 02:40.220
And Pinkie might never have
decided to leave hers.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.620
It might be hard
to imagine Rarity

02:42.620 --> 02:44.540
without her sense
of fabulousness.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.740
But it's even harder to fathom
what my life would be like.

02:48.540 --> 02:49.780
Without this Rainboom,

02:50.020 --> 02:51.980
I might not have gotten
into magic school;

02:52.240 --> 02:54.440
Celestia wouldn't have
taken me on as her pupil

02:54.740 --> 02:56.980
or sent me to Ponyville
to meet my friends.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.880
And the most powerful thing
about cutie mark magic

02:59.880 --> 03:02.540
that I've found is the
connection I share with them.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.000
But, um...

03:13.640 --> 03:16.320
the real question
about cutie mark magic is

03:16.600 --> 03:18.120
who it seems to affect.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.480
Starlight Glimmer?

03:23.760 --> 03:25.340
I was sure I saw her, Spike,

03:25.640 --> 03:27.420
but when I looked
again she was gone.

03:28.140 --> 03:30.000
I'm just worried what
she could be up to.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.600
Nothing good, I bet.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.560
I heard she wasn't very happy
the last time you saw her.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.780
Forcing everypony in her village
to have the same cutie mark

03:37.780 --> 03:40.140
wasn't right. We
had to do something.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.260
And now she's coming
back for revenge.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.800
Or she was just really
interested in your speech.

03:48.620 --> 03:51.620
Honestly, Spike, I'm not
really sure what I saw.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.660
But as long as I
have my friends,

03:54.660 --> 03:56.360
I know everything
will be all right.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.140
Maybe I was just
more stressed

04:02.140 --> 04:03.740
about that speech
than I thought.

04:04.140 --> 04:07.100
Yeah, that sounds better than
Starlight Glimmer coming back

04:07.100 --> 04:08.900
with an evil plot for revenge.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.040
Well, when you say it like that,
it does sound kind of silly.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.400
Or it's totally true!

04:17.380 --> 04:19.760
Welcome home, Twilight!

04:32.260 --> 04:33.600
What are you doing, Starlight?

04:35.220 --> 04:39.160
I'd tell you, but I don't
want to ruin the surprise!

04:41.420 --> 04:42.980
Won't be needing that
anymore.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.120
Where'd she go?

05:17.380 --> 05:20.160
I don't know, Spike. But I
think we better find out.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.320
I guess we could
start with this.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.820
Spike, no! Don't touch that!

05:36.500 --> 05:37.240
Huh.

06:01.940 --> 06:05.360
Cloudsdale! Starlight
doesn't even have wings.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.640
Why would she come here?

06:06.980 --> 06:07.840
I don't know, Spike,

06:08.100 --> 06:10.320
but it looked like she
could fly with just magic.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.160
Keep your eyes open. We don't
know what she has planned.

06:15.180 --> 06:16.640
Isn't that Rainbow Dash?

06:17.120 --> 06:19.320
Did Rainbow Dash look
really young to you?

06:19.900 --> 06:22.920
And I didn't see a cutie
mark. You don't think.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.340
We travelled back in time

06:25.340 --> 06:27.280
to when Rainbow
Dash raced the bullies

06:27.280 --> 06:28.700
who made fun of Fluttershy

06:28.700 --> 06:30.860
and performed her
first Sonic Rainboom?

06:31.480 --> 06:33.580
Spike, only Starswirl
the Bearded

06:33.580 --> 06:34.820
could do
something like that.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.940
And even his spell
just went back a week.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.580
How could Starlight do more

06:38.580 --> 06:40.440
than the greatest
wizard in Equestria?

06:46.660 --> 06:47.560
With this.

06:49.780 --> 06:52.140
Starswirl's spell. Oh, no.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.800
Come on let's go!

06:54.120 --> 06:55.000
Go where?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.420
To watch the race! I don't
want to miss the Rainboom.

07:01.220 --> 07:01.960
Whoa!

07:22.940 --> 07:23.700
Whoa!

07:24.600 --> 07:26.500
Later Rainbow Crash!

07:27.440 --> 07:28.240
Hey!

07:33.320 --> 07:35.160
Aw, sorry about this.

07:40.380 --> 07:42.620
Hey, what gives?

08:26.460 --> 08:27.680
What did you do?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.720
You are about to find out.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.480
I don't know what
Starlight's up to yet,

08:46.880 --> 08:49.180
but we'd better figure it
out before it's too late.

08:49.980 --> 08:54.420
Um, Twilight, I
think it already is.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.440
Uh Twilight,
where's your castle?

09:08.460 --> 09:09.720
The map pulled us back,

09:10.100 --> 09:13.260
but whatever Starlight did in
the past changed things here.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.880
But why? And how did we get
here? And where's here?

09:18.120 --> 09:19.560
More like when.

09:20.080 --> 09:20.620
What do you mean?

09:21.240 --> 09:24.780
Starlight altered Starswirl's
spell, then somehow used it

09:24.780 --> 09:27.680
on the map to travel into the
past and change something.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.540
Once she did, the map pulled
us back to the present.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.420
So we're back where...

09:32.520 --> 09:34.140
I mean, when we started?

09:34.400 --> 09:35.580
Not exactly.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.240
Everything's different.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.560
Look, the map doesn't
even make sense anymore.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.320
The Crystal Empire takes
up half of Equestria.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.660
Plus there's the whole
missing castle thing.

09:46.000 --> 09:46.700
Right.

09:48.260 --> 09:50.240
This is too big to
handle on our own.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.380
You think?

09:51.760 --> 09:53.840
We need to find our
friends and get help.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.580
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this, Twilight.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.140
I know, Spike.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.260
But this is Ponyville.
How bad can things be?

10:20.080 --> 10:22.060
Is that Sugar Cube Corner?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.220
I don't understand.

10:29.540 --> 10:30.160
Rarity?

10:33.580 --> 10:34.340
Rarity?

10:35.520 --> 10:36.900
I don't think she's
here, Spike.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.840
I'm not sure anything
we know is the same,

10:43.020 --> 10:45.380
but I know one place
that could never change.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.060
Applejack?

11:23.900 --> 11:24.840
What can I do for ya?

11:25.080 --> 11:26.480
It's so good to see you!

11:26.660 --> 11:28.380
We couldn't find
Pinkie or Rarity

11:28.380 --> 11:30.120
or Fluttershy
or Rainbow Dash,

11:30.380 --> 11:32.320
but I just knew
you'd still be here.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.500
Of course I am.
This is my home.

11:35.300 --> 11:38.220
But who in tarnation is
Pinkie Bow and Flutter Dash?

11:39.260 --> 11:40.340
Or you for that matter?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.020
You don't know who I am?

11:43.480 --> 11:46.520
Nope. Honestly, the only
name I recognized is Rarity,

11:46.520 --> 11:48.660
but she left for
Manehattan years ago.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.120
Probably to become a world-
famous fashion designer, I bet.

11:52.620 --> 11:53.600
Not
that I know of.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.500
Last I heard, she went
to help with the cause

11:55.500 --> 11:56.660
like everypony else.

11:57.020 --> 11:57.960
The cause?

11:58.240 --> 12:00.800
The war against King Sombra
and the Crystal Empire?

12:01.120 --> 12:01.940
What?

12:03.080 --> 12:04.300
Where have you
two been?

12:05.060 --> 12:06.620
Actually, it's when.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.900
I know this is hard to believe,

12:09.180 --> 12:12.060
but you and I and those other
ponies I mentioned are friends.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.820
Did you bump your head on a
crate of cider or somethin'?

12:15.160 --> 12:18.980
I'm telling you the truth and if
you come with me, I'll prove it.

12:24.220 --> 12:27.120
Well, I'll admit, I've lived in
these here parts my whole life

12:27.120 --> 12:28.480
and I've never seen this before.

12:28.740 --> 12:31.100
There's also supposed to be
a castle that goes with it.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.160
But I still don't see
what this has to do

12:33.160 --> 12:34.500
with you and I
being friends.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.320
Another pony named Starlight
Glimmer used this map

12:37.320 --> 12:39.760
to travel through time and
change things in the past.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.800
For some reason, the
map's here,

12:41.800 --> 12:43.340
but everything
else is different.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.680
Different how?

12:45.060 --> 12:47.040
Well, for one thing,
where we came from,

12:47.040 --> 12:48.680
there's no war with King Sombra.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.960
Maybe you could tell
us how the war started.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.320
Then we can figure out
when everything changed.

12:55.640 --> 12:56.480
That's easy enough.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.760
When the Crystal
Empire returned,

13:00.040 --> 13:01.860
it brought King
Sombra back with it.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.500
And it didn't take long
for him to force

13:11.660 --> 13:14.780
every one of his subjects to
fight for him against Equestria.

14:18.980 --> 14:21.420
And even with Princess
Celestia leading the charge.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.640
It still takes every
last pony in Equestria...

14:27.620 --> 14:28.600
...doing their part...

14:29.620 --> 14:31.040
...working day and night
to keep up the fight.

14:40.820 --> 14:43.580
I just can't believe it.
We stopped King Sombra.

14:43.940 --> 14:45.780
You and me and all
of our friends.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.760
But we aren't friends.
At least not here.

14:49.560 --> 14:50.420
Right.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.580
Look, I hope all this helped,

14:54.760 --> 14:57.460
but I really need to get
back to canning those apples.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.580
Thank you. We're going
to set things right.

15:01.920 --> 15:02.900
I hope you do.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.520
So. How are we going
to set things right?

15:08.080 --> 15:09.060
I DON'T KNOW!

15:10.600 --> 15:12.180
The only thing we know for sure

15:12.180 --> 15:14.320
is that Starlight
stopped the Rainboom.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.000
And that the
map's still here.

15:17.740 --> 15:18.940
Spike! That's it!

15:19.220 --> 15:21.120
The map is connected to
the Tree of Harmony.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.180
It must sense that
something isn't right.

15:23.420 --> 15:24.820
That's why it's still here.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.360
I'll just use Starlight's
version of the spell

15:27.360 --> 15:28.660
and go back a little earlier

15:28.660 --> 15:30.620
and stop her before she
even knows we're there!

15:42.580 --> 15:43.640
Aaaah!

15:44.600 --> 15:46.680
All we have to do now is
find Starlight and st-

15:51.280 --> 15:53.800
<i>Well, finding her</i>
<i>will be easy.</i>

15:54.140 --> 15:57.960
But stopping her's going to
be harder than you think!

15:58.540 --> 16:01.400
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I created that spell

16:01.400 --> 16:03.520
to send myself back in time.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.660
So even when you cast it, I
still get sent back here.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.760
It wasn't difficult to
change Starswirl's spell;

16:11.100 --> 16:12.520
he'd already done the hard part.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.960
But figuring out I could use the
map to go to any time or place

16:17.080 --> 16:18.860
and pull you along with me?

16:19.140 --> 16:22.300
Ha ha! I even impressed
myself with that.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.980
I knew you'd try to stop
me. You're so predictable.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.360
Why else would I leave
the scroll behind?

16:29.580 --> 16:32.040
Touching it triggered
the map to whisk you here

16:32.320 --> 16:34.880
and watch me erase
the one thing

16:34.880 --> 16:36.600
that linked
you with your friends.

16:37.740 --> 16:40.480
My village was a
sanctuary of equality

16:40.500 --> 16:43.480
where no pony's cutie mark
allowed them to feel superior.

16:43.900 --> 16:48.340
It was a special place, and you
and your friends took it away.

16:52.860 --> 16:55.920
Now it's my turn to take
something special from you.

16:56.240 --> 17:00.040
Without the Rainboom, you and
your friends will never form

17:00.040 --> 17:02.260
your special cutie mark bond.

17:02.600 --> 17:07.060
Cutie marks for cutie marks.
Sounds like a fair trade to me.

17:24.560 --> 17:28.280
Twilight!

17:28.480 --> 17:29.140
Whoops!

17:34.100 --> 17:34.760
Thanks.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.120
No problem, Spike.

17:36.460 --> 17:38.820
At least now we know
exactly what we have to do.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.180
OK. Keep your eyes peeled.

17:52.340 --> 17:52.900
Right.

17:53.260 --> 17:54.460
We have to stop Starlight

17:54.460 --> 17:56.900
as soon as Rainbow Dash
and those bullies race by.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.260
Um, Twilight...

17:59.460 --> 18:00.440
So be ready.

18:01.060 --> 18:01.900
I know, but...

18:01.900 --> 18:03.780
Because she could
pop up anywhere.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.100
Like over there?

18:08.560 --> 18:10.820
Just remember
how you'd feel

18:10.820 --> 18:12.720
if someone said
those things to you.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.560
What's going on here?

18:15.800 --> 18:18.440
Oh, I was just reminding
these two colts

18:18.440 --> 18:20.620
how hurtful teasing can be.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.180
Well, don't!

18:22.960 --> 18:24.060
Huh?

18:25.560 --> 18:27.080
I mean... You were?

18:27.640 --> 18:31.340
Of course. In a world where
every pony is unique,

18:31.580 --> 18:34.920
some are bound to feel
more special than others.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.340
But that isn't a licence
to be cruel is it?

18:39.400 --> 18:41.280
No. Of course not.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.500
Isn't it a shame
we don't live in a world

18:44.500 --> 18:46.580
where everypony is equal.

18:46.980 --> 18:51.120
No one would ever tease anyone
there. Wouldn't that be nice?

18:51.340 --> 18:52.440
Mm hm!

18:52.880 --> 18:54.000
No. It wouldn't!

18:54.880 --> 18:57.880
I mean, it'd be nice not
to be teased, of course,

18:58.100 --> 18:59.700
but that's not the same thing.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.060
Come on, Fluttershy.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.560
Maybe I can help you get
through the course this time.

19:04.860 --> 19:08.500
Well, I sure could
use the practice.

19:11.420 --> 19:14.360
I know you only convinced those
bullies to not tease Fluttershy

19:14.360 --> 19:15.460
to stop the Rainboom.

19:15.880 --> 19:19.400
Oh, that's not true. I convinced
them not to be bullies

19:19.400 --> 19:22.060
because everypony
should be equal.

19:22.340 --> 19:24.840
Stopping the Rainboom
is just a bonus.

19:27.000 --> 19:27.520
Look!

19:29.840 --> 19:31.280
This isn't over yet!

19:33.540 --> 19:35.320
If you say so.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.240
Hi!

19:41.800 --> 19:43.320
Um, hi.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.000
You think you can
stop for a minute?

19:45.280 --> 19:45.900
Sure!

19:47.480 --> 19:49.480
I hear you're pretty fast.

19:49.680 --> 19:53.040
Pretty fast? Please. I'm
even faster than that.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.660
OK, so, um... Hey
you wanna race?

19:57.120 --> 19:59.260
Um. That wouldn't
really be fair.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.280
I mean, you're
a full grown pony.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.020
And, wait, are
you an Alicorn?

20:04.260 --> 20:06.120
Come on, I thought
you were fast.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.380
Actually, I just remembered I
have somewhere I need to be.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.500
OK, listen. You don't
have to race me.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.840
I just need you to fly fast
enough for a Sonic Rainboom.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.000
What? I can't do
that. Nopony can.

20:22.200 --> 20:26.420
It's not even a real thing.
It's just an old mare's tale.

20:26.540 --> 20:28.220
But it's not! I
know it's not.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.320
I've seen you do it.
In the future!

20:32.280 --> 20:35.080
OK. I'm gonna go now.

20:36.260 --> 20:37.340
No! Wait!

20:41.220 --> 20:43.780
Gee, Twilight.
What's the matter?

20:44.020 --> 20:48.300
Couldn't convince her to do the
impossible? That's too bad.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.860
Well, that
didn't work.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.360
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

21:04.620 --> 21:05.860
We'll have to try again.

21:06.420 --> 21:07.400
Hey, Twilight.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.460
I don't want to live in
that awful future we saw.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.880
I don't think you'll have to.

21:16.380 --> 21:18.180
Pinkie? Fluttershy?

21:18.340 --> 21:20.700
SILENCE, CHANGELING!

21:21.920 --> 21:24.980
All servants of Queen
Chrysalis found in these woods

21:24.980 --> 21:27.640
must be destroyed!
