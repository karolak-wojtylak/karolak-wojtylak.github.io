WEBVTT

00:02.970 --> 00:06.105
The Tree of Harmony remains one
of the most powerful sources

00:06.207 --> 00:08.274
of magic known to ponydom.

00:08.376 --> 00:11.777
And though it has been at the
"root" of Magic and Friendship

00:11.879 --> 00:15.481
from the moment it was planted,
its ways are mysterious.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.317
Almost as if it has
a mind of its own.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.653
Mind? Pfft. It's a tree.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.889
A tree that grew
a castle!

00:25.493 --> 00:28.928
Was that before or after
Discord made chocolate rain?

00:29.230 --> 00:29.996
[whisper] After.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.731
I'm never going to
learn Pony history!

00:33.618 --> 00:36.502
You can all show me what you've
learned on tomorrow's test!

00:36.604 --> 00:39.471
Friendship's effect on the
course of Equestrian History.

00:41.442 --> 00:44.778
Remember, study groups are
both fun AND effective!

00:46.280 --> 00:48.180
Sandbar: So.. who wants to
study together?

00:48.582 --> 00:51.517
With other students?
This is Equestria!

00:51.719 --> 00:55.053
If you want the real scoop,
there's only one place to go!

00:56.490 --> 01:00.993
Hello, oh magical
Equestrian tree!

01:01.095 --> 01:04.896
Can you tell me <i>everything</i> I
need to know about friendship?

01:56.183 --> 01:58.484
The Elements of Harmony
grew the tree?

01:58.786 --> 02:02.221
[sigh] No. The pillars
grew the tree.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.657
The tree grew the elements. And
then the box with six locks.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.626
But our professors
found six keys

02:07.728 --> 02:09.395
and unlocked
the box.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.563
I'm so gonna fail..

02:11.665 --> 02:13.799
You guys! Check
this out!

02:15.536 --> 02:17.869
That's a plumbing diagram
on how to fix a sink.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.840
What does that have to do
with Equestrian History?

02:21.942 --> 02:25.044
Nothing. I just can't believe
that's how sinks work!

02:25.346 --> 02:26.312
Where's Yona?

02:32.654 --> 02:36.555
[chuckle] Apparently, yaks no
love study groups!

02:36.657 --> 02:38.657
Shhhh. Haha.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.164
SPIDER! NO!

02:51.739 --> 02:54.306
Hey Cozy. What are
you doing here?

02:54.508 --> 02:57.776
I volunteered to help Professor
Sparkle organize these books.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.679
So? Experts on
Friendship History yet?

03:00.781 --> 03:03.148
I think I'd be better off
studying the plumbing book.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.916
This stuff is impossible.

03:06.087 --> 03:11.490
Oh, come on, Gallus! With good
friends and solid study habits,

03:11.592 --> 03:13.692
anything is possible!

03:15.128 --> 03:16.228
How about you just tell us

03:16.330 --> 03:18.163
what's on tomorrow's
test, Professor?

03:18.265 --> 03:20.099
Yeah! Please! Come on!

03:20.201 --> 03:23.435
Now hold on a sec. I can't
give y'all a sneak peek!

03:23.637 --> 03:25.804
That there wouldn't be honest!

03:30.578 --> 03:35.047
Ahem. Golly, it's so inspiring how
relaxed you all are about

03:35.149 --> 03:39.018
studying friendship
considering your disadvantage.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.286
What cute pony mean?

03:41.588 --> 03:44.056
Just consider where
you all came from!

03:44.158 --> 03:47.492
If Sandbar hadn't sacrificed
so much of his time

03:47.594 --> 03:50.962
to get you up to speed? Who
knows how behind you'd be?

03:52.566 --> 03:53.932
That's not--

03:54.034 --> 03:57.436
I mean, growing up as a
love-starved changeling!

03:57.538 --> 04:00.706
Or hiding underwater from an
evil king all those years!

04:00.808 --> 04:04.343
Trusting any creature
must be so hard for you!

04:04.645 --> 04:07.579
And Griffons never want
to be around any creature.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.014
Even other griffons!

04:09.416 --> 04:11.950
And dragons are so
fierce compared to us.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.786
There must be days you
can't wait to get away

04:14.888 --> 04:16.889
from all us cute ponies.

04:17.291 --> 04:20.359
Everypony know "yaks
think yaks are best".

04:20.561 --> 04:22.027
Making friends with
any other creature

04:22.129 --> 04:23.964
must seem like a step down.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.599
It's just so impressive
how you keep trying

04:27.701 --> 04:29.201
to understand friendship,

04:29.303 --> 04:31.736
even though it isn't
in your nature.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.675
Oh! I'll let you borrow my
notes! It's what friends do!

04:36.777 --> 04:37.910
I'll be right back!

04:39.112 --> 04:42.380
We should get
back to studying...

04:53.194 --> 04:55.627
Could you stop that clicking!?
I'm trying to focus.

04:55.929 --> 04:56.862
Dude...

04:56.964 --> 04:59.765
What? We have a test. I
don't know every detail

04:59.867 --> 05:02.834
about every adventure the
professors went on like you do.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.103
That's why we're
studying together.

05:05.205 --> 05:08.573
Right. To help us
"disadvantaged" creatures.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.642
Yona confused. Why
we all upset?

05:20.654 --> 05:22.387
I only glanced at
that plumbing book,

05:22.489 --> 05:25.223
but I'm pretty sure this
isn't supposed to be here.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.494
What are you doing?

05:28.896 --> 05:32.531
Dragon. Strange Magical Cave.
What do you think I'm doing?

05:47.548 --> 05:49.848
Did we know this was down here?

05:49.950 --> 05:52.918
I don't think anypony
knows this is down here.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.590
Welcome.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.192
Headmare Twilight?
Where are we?

06:01.394 --> 06:03.095
Where you need to be.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.063
Uh. Yona confused.

06:05.165 --> 06:09.635
It is as I feared. You are not
one. What has happened?

06:09.737 --> 06:12.871
We were studying Friendship's
effect on History but then...

06:13.073 --> 06:16.942
Since friendship just isn't in
our nature, what's the point?

06:17.244 --> 06:20.112
You do not believe
friendship is in your nature?

06:20.514 --> 06:22.814
That is NOT ACCEPTABLE!

06:24.418 --> 06:27.118
Our headmare is
glowing, you guys!

06:27.220 --> 06:29.354
What is going on!?

06:29.656 --> 06:32.056
We should probably get back
to studying for the test.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.894
A test. Yes.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.063
By sunrise, this
door will be closed.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.832
Finish the test before
then and you may go.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.535
Fail the test and
here you will stay.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.543
Huh?

06:53.480 --> 06:54.212
Huh?

06:56.550 --> 06:57.182
Huh?

07:05.458 --> 07:06.191
OH!

07:09.362 --> 07:10.829
Mt. Aris!?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.964
Headmare Twilight
sent me home?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.301
Wait. Am I suspended?

07:16.903 --> 07:17.936
Hello?

07:18.138 --> 07:19.471
Anygriff here?

07:19.873 --> 07:20.705
Hmm.

07:20.807 --> 07:21.940
They must be topside.

07:23.844 --> 07:24.476
Huh?

07:25.179 --> 07:25.811
Oh!

07:28.482 --> 07:29.314
Agh!

07:32.452 --> 07:33.084
Ah!

07:36.923 --> 07:38.523
THE STORM KING?

07:38.625 --> 07:39.958
He's BACK?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.129
Big room. No exits.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.264
Big deal.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.471
Not cool..

07:56.743 --> 07:59.578
Nothing for yaks
to be afraid of.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.616
Just empty cave. Nothing
in here can hurt...

08:05.440 --> 08:06.340
...Yona!

08:09.390 --> 08:13.259
Ugh. Things like this just don't
happen in the Dragonlands.

08:13.861 --> 08:17.930
-Huh?
-And I told her she was the
cutest pony of all ponies!

08:18.432 --> 08:21.700
Oooh! Aren't you just
the most ADORABLE thing?

08:21.802 --> 08:22.668
Come join us!

08:23.970 --> 08:26.805
No. On so many levels, no.

08:32.244 --> 08:32.644
Huh?

08:32.746 --> 08:35.280
Come sit by me and let's
compliment each other!

08:36.282 --> 08:37.148
Agh!

08:40.387 --> 08:42.554
[gasp] Why do you look
like that?

08:42.756 --> 08:43.722
What do you mean?

08:43.824 --> 08:44.856
We all look the same.

08:45.158 --> 08:45.958
Not me.

08:46.460 --> 08:49.995
Of course not you,
Your Majesty.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.097
We'll go drain the love from
those pathetic ponies

08:52.199 --> 08:54.566
in Ponyville just
as you ordered!

08:55.168 --> 08:59.337
[gasp] NO!

09:02.943 --> 09:05.610
Oh, thank HEAVENS
we've found you!

09:05.712 --> 09:08.913
There's an emergency
and we need YOU, Sandbar!

09:10.250 --> 09:12.784
Ah! My first friendship adventure!

09:12.886 --> 09:14.352
Yes! Count me in!

09:14.454 --> 09:15.620
I've been waiting
for this--

09:16.122 --> 09:17.255
Wait. The others!

09:17.557 --> 09:19.024
We don't need <i>them</i>!

09:19.226 --> 09:21.192
We need you! Come on!

09:32.072 --> 09:33.204
Come on, Gallus.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.473
Get it together.

09:34.875 --> 09:35.807
Deep breaths.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.446
Ah...ah...ah choo!

09:46.587 --> 09:50.322
OK, if this is a test,
there's got to be a way out.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.759
It's just a puzzle...
that will squash you

09:54.361 --> 09:56.295
if you don't
figure it out.

10:05.638 --> 10:06.639
Ah ha!

10:07.641 --> 10:08.540
No pressure.

10:15.582 --> 10:16.047
Oops!

10:33.278 --> 10:34.778
Grrrr.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.004
Look. I have to get out of here
and find my friends,

10:39.106 --> 10:41.806
so just tell me what I have
to do to pass this test.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.442
I'm not afraid of anything.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.310
Um. I don't know.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.513
Seems like she's afraid to be
cute and adorable, doesn't it?

10:48.615 --> 10:51.382
Or maybe she's just
afraid to admit

10:51.484 --> 10:55.353
she <i>likes</i> being
cute and adorable.

10:55.555 --> 10:56.422
Mm hm.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.423
Just this once.

10:58.625 --> 11:02.227
[ahem] May I have
some tea, please?

11:02.329 --> 11:06.365
Oh, but you can't have tea
if you aren't dressed for it!

11:07.567 --> 11:09.534
OK. But let's keep
this between us.

11:24.717 --> 11:25.383
Ah!
[crash]

11:40.066 --> 11:41.800
YONA NEED HELP!

11:41.902 --> 11:44.970
WHERE YONA'S FRIENDS
WHEN YONA NEEDS THEM?

11:51.320 --> 11:52.020
Huh!?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.781
Yona no mean to scream...

11:57.083 --> 11:59.317
Yona love making friends.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.252
Spiders... friends?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.892
Wait. What little spider say?

12:13.667 --> 12:14.933
What happened
to you?

12:15.506 --> 12:16.822
What happened to you?

12:19.723 --> 12:21.739
You never saw ANY
of that, got it?

12:25.345 --> 12:28.013
Maybe the others got out
already and we're the last ones?

12:28.215 --> 12:31.349
Yeah. That totally seems like
something they would do...

12:31.619 --> 12:34.653
Hmph. Any other dragon or griffon
would save themselves

12:34.755 --> 12:36.688
and get out of this crazy cave.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.924
Guess we aren't just <i>any</i>
dragon and griffon anymore.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.961
Guess not. You go that way.
I'll check over there.

12:51.938 --> 12:55.039
Wait. I really should
find my friends.

12:56.143 --> 12:59.644
Darling, it was so generous
of you to take the time

12:59.746 --> 13:02.380
to teach those other
creatures about friendship.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.984
But.. if you're going to join us
and do something that really

13:06.086 --> 13:10.255
makes a difference, we need to
know where your loyalty lies.

13:10.757 --> 13:14.792
You do want to impress
us, don't you, Sandbar?

13:22.736 --> 13:23.368
Huh?

13:23.970 --> 13:25.036
Ocellus?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.338
Go away.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.474
We're still in those weird
caves beneath the school!

13:29.576 --> 13:31.042
We've got to get out of here!

13:33.246 --> 13:36.581
[gasp] Chrysalis!
Where's Ocellus!?

13:36.783 --> 13:40.051
[sob] It's me! I'm HIDEOUS!

13:43.857 --> 13:45.022
Hello!?

13:46.726 --> 13:47.592
Where are--Whoa!

13:49.029 --> 13:51.896
SHHHHH! The Storm
King will hear you!

13:51.998 --> 13:53.197
The Storm King?

13:53.299 --> 13:54.465
He was defeated.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.667
We're still under
the school.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.402
This is all just
some crazy test!

14:01.207 --> 14:02.874
OK, that's horrifying.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.411
I can't find any
hippogriffs or seaponies!

14:06.513 --> 14:08.145
They must all be captured!

14:10.383 --> 14:12.784
Gallus! Get back down here!

14:23.196 --> 14:24.629
It's not real!

14:25.031 --> 14:26.031
Yes, it is!

14:26.133 --> 14:28.299
He's back and I'm never going
to see another sunset

14:28.401 --> 14:31.202
or fly through a cloud
bank or study plumbing!

14:31.304 --> 14:33.638
He's going to take
away everything I love...

14:33.740 --> 14:36.842
I'm going to be trapped
down here forever!

14:37.344 --> 14:38.911
I'm afraid of
being trapped too.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.479
I'm scared of
small spaces.

14:41.781 --> 14:42.580
Really?

14:42.882 --> 14:43.615
Yeah...

14:44.117 --> 14:46.151
And I was stuck in a
room that kept shrinking.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.554
But I realized I had to face my
fear and I found the way out.

14:49.756 --> 14:52.157
This is your test. He
isn't really here.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.927
But what if he is..!?

14:56.129 --> 14:58.463
Then tell him exactly
what you think of him!

15:02.969 --> 15:04.235
H-h-hey!

15:04.437 --> 15:05.537
Storm King!

15:05.839 --> 15:08.439
You're nothing but
a big ole bully

15:08.741 --> 15:11.943
with a silly name
and a goofy crown!

15:12.145 --> 15:16.481
You thought you could scare us
into doing whatever you wanted!

15:16.683 --> 15:21.019
But we learned that together
we're STRONGER than you!

15:21.221 --> 15:22.887
And now that
we're rid of you,

15:22.989 --> 15:27.625
we're gonna SOAR THROUGH THE
SKY and go on adventures

15:27.727 --> 15:32.396
and NEVER GIVE YOU
ANOTHER THOUGHT. EVER!

15:36.736 --> 15:37.902
Haha!

15:38.104 --> 15:39.137
I did it!

15:39.239 --> 15:41.138
I told him!

15:42.609 --> 15:44.776
OK, hug time later.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.444
We still have to get
back to the library.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.780
You're a changeling.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.149
Just.. change back.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.550
I can't.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.221
Maybe my past
was so horrible,

15:57.323 --> 15:59.991
it's still inside me just
waiting to come out again!

16:00.393 --> 16:01.659
That's ridiculous.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.628
That's not who you are anymore.

16:03.730 --> 16:04.896
You've changed.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.299
Maybe we can't really
change THAT much.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.435
[mumbling] I like cute, silly stuff!

16:10.637 --> 16:12.070
I'm sorry, what?

16:12.172 --> 16:14.506
I LIKE cute,
silly stuff!

16:15.108 --> 16:18.910
But ever since school started,
I've realized that sometimes

16:19.112 --> 16:21.145
I kinda don't mind cute stuff.

16:24.785 --> 16:28.252
If a dragon like me can
admit she likes... tea parties,

16:28.454 --> 16:30.955
that's proof we
CAN change.

16:31.257 --> 16:34.058
I was gonna invite you to a
top-secret tea party with me,

16:34.160 --> 16:36.427
but if you want
to stay down here...

16:36.929 --> 16:39.030
Oh, no! I wanna come!

16:40.700 --> 16:42.500
I thought that
might work.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.968
Come on, let's go!

16:47.140 --> 16:48.539
Where's Yona
and Sandbar?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.241
The way out
is closing!

16:50.343 --> 16:51.876
We aren't leaving
without them.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.146
YONA FIND YOU GUYS!

16:55.547 --> 16:56.323
Argh!

16:56.548 --> 16:59.684
Hey, Yona. Who's
your.. spider army?

16:59.786 --> 17:03.721
Yona always scared of spiders
but then Yona meet Spindle!

17:05.992 --> 17:08.626
Yona realize no
reason to be afraid!

17:08.728 --> 17:10.728
Spiders and yak friends!

17:10.830 --> 17:14.132
So Yona ask new friends for
help finding old friends!

17:14.334 --> 17:17.802
Do you think your new friends
can help us find Sandbar?

17:21.041 --> 17:23.341
Of all the strange things
that have happened tonight,

17:23.643 --> 17:25.510
that's the strangest, right?

17:29.749 --> 17:31.249
OK. Enough!

17:31.351 --> 17:33.283
I'm not going anywhere
without my friends.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.622
So you don't care about
anypony but your friends?

17:37.824 --> 17:40.191
Are you really
that selfish?

17:40.293 --> 17:43.528
Honestly, you really are
such a disappointment.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.263
I've always looked up to you.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.831
You would never turn
your back on each other.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.433
And that's what
makes you strong.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.368
And now I have a group
of friends that I think

17:50.470 --> 17:52.237
is every bit as
amazing as yours.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.639
If I have to give up on
them to make you proud,

17:54.741 --> 17:56.574
then you aren't the
ponies I thought you were.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.409
I don't care if
I disappoint you.

17:58.611 --> 17:59.878
You disappoint me.

18:03.216 --> 18:07.318
Did you just tell our professors
you were disappointed in them!?

18:07.520 --> 18:10.688
Something tells me those
weren't actually our professors.

18:10.790 --> 18:14.358
Besides, they tried to get
between me and my friends!

18:14.460 --> 18:16.761
That's all very sweet.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.829
Now can we please
get out of here?

18:29.042 --> 18:32.209
You! You're not Headmare
Twilight, are you?

18:33.814 --> 18:36.180
[gasp] You're the Tree
of Harmony!

18:37.717 --> 18:40.418
The Tree of Harmony turned
into a sparkly version

18:40.520 --> 18:42.687
of our headmare to talk to us?

18:43.089 --> 18:44.923
Did I miss a chapter in class?

18:45.225 --> 18:48.226
Like all living things,
I change as I grow.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.828
As I have grown, so
have my abilities.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.464
I'm a bit rusty
on Pony history,

18:53.566 --> 18:56.034
but since when does the Tree
of Harmony trap creatures

18:56.136 --> 18:58.003
in a cave with their
biggest fears!?

18:58.605 --> 19:01.606
You chose what you saw
in my roots, not me.

19:02.309 --> 19:06.011
[gasp] Our friendship got
us past our fears!

19:07.113 --> 19:09.347
You were more concerned with
each other's well being

19:09.449 --> 19:10.215
than your own.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.683
You were strong when
your friends were weak.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.219
You let each other in and
showed that you would be there

19:15.321 --> 19:16.788
for each other,
no matter what.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.357
Friendship IS in
your nature.

19:26.132 --> 19:29.266
We just learned a friendship
lesson from a tree, didn't we.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.271
You're all right!

19:33.373 --> 19:35.239
I came back with my
notes and saw this

19:35.341 --> 19:36.974
and didn't know
what to think.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.910
We're better than
all right!

19:39.112 --> 19:41.779
We just got tested by
the Tree of Harmony!

19:41.881 --> 19:44.315
And we totally passed!

19:44.917 --> 19:47.418
The Tree of
Harmony? Here?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.687
Yeah! Well. Below here.

19:49.789 --> 19:50.723
Under the school!

19:51.024 --> 19:54.058
We found this and went down and
met the Tree and Gallus was all

19:54.260 --> 19:56.260
"friendship is NOT
in our nature"

19:56.362 --> 19:58.028
and the tree was like WHAT!?

19:58.130 --> 19:59.530
And it tested us!

20:00.032 --> 20:01.199
Long story short.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.601
Friendship IS in our nature.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.336
The Tree said so.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.672
I guess we should tell somepony
there's a giant magical hole

20:08.774 --> 20:09.774
in the library.

20:10.576 --> 20:12.243
[clang] Or not.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.578
We have to tell our
professors about this!

20:14.680 --> 20:15.546
They won't believe--

20:15.648 --> 20:16.481
You can't!

20:16.883 --> 20:17.782
Why no?

20:17.984 --> 20:20.718
Because... it's my fault!

20:21.020 --> 20:23.054
You were all getting
along so well

20:23.156 --> 20:26.157
and I felt left out.
I was jealous.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.928
And it upset you so much the
Tree of Harmony had to test you!

20:30.230 --> 20:33.798
Oh! I'm gonna get
expelled for sure!

20:34.100 --> 20:36.767
[sobbing] Please don't tell
anypony about this!

20:36.869 --> 20:38.102
Especially the Professors!

20:38.204 --> 20:39.003
PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE!

20:39.105 --> 20:39.871
OK!

20:39.974 --> 20:44.174
[yawn] I'm actually too tired
to do anything right now.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.544
Yeah. But we can't
go to sleep.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.946
We'll miss the test.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.214
The TEST! I
almost forgot.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.351
We're all gonna fail.

20:58.591 --> 21:02.026
What if I tell Professor Sparkle
I needed help organizing

21:02.128 --> 21:04.562
these books and you were all
kind enough to pitch in?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.063
I'll get you an extension!

21:06.699 --> 21:10.268
[yawn] Thanks, Cozy.
That's nice of you.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.738
I'm just so sorry I
caused all of this.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.506
You're such good friends.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.276
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.879
Mmmm. No prob.

21:21.181 --> 21:24.315
Friendship is.... Zzzzzzz.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.717
You get some rest.

21:25.919 --> 21:27.952
Don't give any of
this another thought.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.088
Just let Cozy take
care of everything....
