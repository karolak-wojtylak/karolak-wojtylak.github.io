00:11.820 --> 00:13.893
Not too fast now, Angel bunny.

00:13.894 --> 00:16.099
You don't wanna get a tummy ache.

00:20.429 --> 00:23.379
You really should eat more
than that, don't you think?

00:25.182 --> 00:26.427
It's not playtime yet.

00:29.181 --> 00:30.813
I know you wanna run, but...

00:30.956 --> 00:32.731
...just three more bites.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.117
Two more bites?

00:35.194 --> 00:36.552
One more bite?

00:36.733 --> 00:38.507
Pretty please.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.154
Oh... goodness.

00:43.232 --> 00:44.478
Are you okay?

00:45.072 --> 00:48.121
Are you coughing because there's
a carrot stuck in your throat?

00:48.987 --> 00:50.771
Because you need some water?

00:53.787 --> 00:57.574
Because of that giant cloud
of scary black smoke?

00:58.749 --> 01:01.416
I'll take that as a yes.

01:40.896 --> 01:42.871
Help! Help!

01:43.071 --> 01:45.378
Please? Help?

01:45.556 --> 01:48.329
There's... there's a horrible cloud of smoke.

01:49.591 --> 01:51.033
It's headed this way and...

01:52.212 --> 01:55.367
Don't be such a scaredy-pony. It's just me.

01:55.368 --> 01:58.018
Future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder.

01:58.019 --> 01:59.868
246... 247...

01:59.869 --> 02:02.366
This calls for a celebration!

02:02.367 --> 02:03.790
Oh... No, Pinkie Pie.

02:03.791 --> 02:07.832
This is no time for celebration.
This is a time for panic. For...

02:08.416 --> 02:09.901
I'm gonna need balloons!

02:09.902 --> 02:12.202
One for everypony in Ponyville.

02:12.203 --> 02:13.850
There's... there's smoke.

02:13.851 --> 02:16.380
And... and where there's
smoke, there's fire. And...

02:16.381 --> 02:17.218
Let's see...

02:17.219 --> 02:21.453
-That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
-...254, 255...

02:21.454 --> 02:22.514
No, wait.

02:22.515 --> 02:23.695
7!

02:23.813 --> 02:26.392
Pinkie Pie! Now I have to start over.

02:26.393 --> 02:28.860
We're all gonna have to start over.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.633
In a new village. Because ours is gonna be...

02:31.634 --> 02:33.353
Hey Rainbow Dash! Wait up!

02:33.354 --> 02:37.439
Oh, please. This is an emergency.
I need everypony to...

02:37.440 --> 02:38.539
Listen up!

02:39.609 --> 02:42.030
Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria.

02:43.823 --> 02:45.297
That's what I've been trying to...

02:45.298 --> 02:46.526
But don't worry.

02:46.527 --> 02:51.180
I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia
informing me that it is not coming from a fire.

02:51.181 --> 02:53.027
Oh, thank goodness.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.375
It's coming from a dragon.

02:56.052 --> 02:58.818
A... d-d-d-dragon...?

02:59.997 --> 03:05.028
What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled
is a full-grown dragon doin' here in Equestria?

03:05.029 --> 03:06.007
Sleeping.

03:07.345 --> 03:09.925
According to Princess Celestia,
he's taking a nap.

03:10.419 --> 03:12.651
His snoring is what's causing all the smoke.

03:12.865 --> 03:16.134
He should really see a doctor.
That doesn't sound healthy at all.

03:16.334 --> 03:19.286
Well, at least he's not snoring fire.

03:19.287 --> 03:21.470
What are we meant to do about it?

03:21.471 --> 03:23.220
I'll tell you what we're meant to do.

03:23.221 --> 03:25.223
Give 'im a boot. Take that!

03:26.451 --> 03:27.851
And that!

03:29.496 --> 03:33.287
We need to encourage him
to take a nap somewhere else.

03:33.608 --> 03:37.072
Princess Celestia has given us
this mission and we must not fail.

03:37.073 --> 03:40.772
If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke
for the next one hundred years.

03:41.366 --> 03:43.949
Huh. Talk about getting your beauty sleep.

03:43.950 --> 03:46.893
All right, everypony.
I need you to gather supplies quickly.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.671
We've got a long journey ahead of us.

03:48.672 --> 03:50.623
Let's meet back here in less than an hour.

03:50.705 --> 03:54.514
Okay, girls! You heard her.
The fate of Equestria is in our hoofs.

03:54.515 --> 03:56.551
Do we have what it takes?

03:57.533 --> 03:58.601
We can do it!

04:00.410 --> 04:02.668
Um... Actually...

04:23.925 --> 04:24.949
Oh... I mean...

04:33.838 --> 04:35.986
Much better! Onward!

04:42.469 --> 04:43.886
Let's go!

04:43.887 --> 04:46.570
Um... let's not?

04:50.272 --> 04:51.929
All right, girls. Listen up.

04:51.930 --> 04:53.654
I'm mapping out the fastest route...

04:53.655 --> 04:57.305
...but we've all got to keep a good pace if we
expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall.

04:57.823 --> 04:59.286
M-m-mountain?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.855
The dragon is in that cave at the very top.

05:01.856 --> 05:03.254
Look pretty cold up there.

05:03.454 --> 05:07.242
You bet it is. The higher you go,
the chillier it gets.

05:07.243 --> 05:09.019
Good thing I've brought my scarf.

05:10.343 --> 05:11.970
Ooo... Pretty.

05:13.539 --> 05:16.826
Oh, yeah. That'll keep you nice and cozy.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.548
Um... excuse me. Twilight?

05:26.648 --> 05:28.740
-I know you're busy, but...
-Uh-huh.

05:29.064 --> 05:30.575
Oh, we could go this way.

05:30.576 --> 05:33.048
-But if I could just have a second...
-Uh-huh.

05:33.317 --> 05:35.018
Now, we wanna avoid that.

05:35.862 --> 05:38.318
So, um... I was thinking that...

05:38.319 --> 05:42.427
Um... maybe I should just stay here at Ponyville.

05:42.974 --> 05:45.039
-Uh-huh.
-Oh! Good.

05:45.207 --> 05:46.688
I'll stay here and...

05:46.689 --> 05:48.323
Wait! You have to come.

05:48.324 --> 05:51.107
Your way with wild animals
will surely come in handy.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.026
I don't think I...

05:53.027 --> 05:55.156
Oh, and don't worry about your
little friends in the meadow.

05:55.157 --> 05:56.937
Spike's got it covered while you're gone.

05:56.938 --> 05:58.214
You can count on me.

06:00.946 --> 06:02.842
Hey! Hey! Wait!

06:03.014 --> 06:05.443
I don't know I think he's up to the task. Maybe...

06:06.481 --> 06:08.028
But... but...

06:09.130 --> 06:11.671
Are you sure you want
Fluttershy to come along?

06:11.672 --> 06:14.053
I mean, that pony is afraid of her own shadow.

06:14.054 --> 06:16.187
She's just gonna slow us down.

06:16.188 --> 06:17.746
Oh, she's just a little nervous.

06:17.747 --> 06:20.250
Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.423
All right, girls!

06:28.539 --> 06:29.939
Move out!

06:30.688 --> 06:31.808
But... but...

06:41.013 --> 06:42.573
Wow... What was that?

06:42.574 --> 06:45.534
That is what it sound like
when a dragon snores.

06:45.859 --> 06:47.383
It's... it's so...

06:48.912 --> 06:49.484
...high.

06:49.485 --> 06:51.669
Well, it IS a mountain.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.127
I'm gonna fly up there and check it out!

06:55.333 --> 06:58.276
Hold on now. I think
we should all go up together.

06:58.277 --> 06:59.867
Safety in numbers and all.

07:00.255 --> 07:02.312
Oh, all right.

07:04.041 --> 07:07.610
I hear the only thing that sparkles
more than the dragon's scales...

07:07.611 --> 07:10.273
...are the jewels they use to build their nests.

07:11.049 --> 07:14.871
If I play my cards right, I might be
able to convince him to part with a few.

07:15.375 --> 07:18.962
Welcome to my cave, Rarity?
Care for a diamond?

07:24.128 --> 07:26.472
Girls! This is no laughing matter!

07:27.064 --> 07:29.607
Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures.

07:29.608 --> 07:31.627
What do you think the dragon will be like?

07:33.223 --> 07:34.343
Fluttershy?

07:34.629 --> 07:36.962
Hey! What are you waiting for?

07:37.251 --> 07:38.570
An invitation?

07:38.571 --> 07:40.610
Ooo! I think I have one in my bag!

07:43.001 --> 07:45.275
It... it's so... so...

07:45.680 --> 07:46.740
...steep.

07:46.741 --> 07:48.608
Well, it IS a cliff.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.707
You could just... oh, I don't know, fly up here?

07:51.984 --> 07:55.230
Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it.
Flap those wings.

07:55.327 --> 07:57.202
O... okay.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.530
We don't have time for this.

08:14.892 --> 08:16.136
What are you doing?

08:16.236 --> 08:18.976
I'll need this if I'm gonna take her
around the mountain another way.

08:18.977 --> 08:21.752
Uh... Around the mountain?!

08:22.112 --> 08:24.268
That's gonna take them forever.

08:30.167 --> 08:33.182
Don't worry, Twi. We'll be there lickety split.

08:37.366 --> 08:39.385
WOOHOO! I win again!

08:39.386 --> 08:42.012
Ugh... That's thirty-five games in a row.

08:42.293 --> 08:43.660
Best of seventy-one?

08:46.721 --> 08:49.269
We... made... it...

08:50.095 --> 08:52.330
Told you it was gonna take them forever.

09:06.553 --> 09:08.031
Your turn, Fluttershy.

09:08.419 --> 09:11.143
But it's so wide.

09:11.198 --> 09:14.416
Come on, Fluttershy.
We should be much farther along by now.

09:14.634 --> 09:16.754
You could just leap on over.

09:16.755 --> 09:17.875
I...

09:20.441 --> 09:21.331
I don't know.

09:22.222 --> 09:25.351
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's just a hop, skip and a jump.

09:25.923 --> 09:26.687
See?

09:26.909 --> 09:29.225
<i>It's not very far
just move your little rump</i>

09:29.226 --> 09:32.025
<i>You can make it if you try
with a hop, skip and jump</i>

09:32.026 --> 09:33.319
We don't have time for this.

09:33.519 --> 09:35.862
<i>A hop, skip and jump
just move your little rump</i>

09:35.863 --> 09:37.771
<i>A hop, skip and jump
A hop, skip and jump</i>

09:37.772 --> 09:39.215
<i>Ahopskipandjump
Ahopskipandjump</i>

09:39.216 --> 09:40.184
<i>Ahopskipandjump!</i>

09:40.293 --> 09:42.871
Okay. Here I go.

09:43.487 --> 09:44.587
A hop...

09:45.113 --> 09:47.021
-That's it!
-You're almost there.

09:47.022 --> 09:47.961
...skip...

09:48.412 --> 09:49.837
Just don't look down.

10:03.159 --> 10:05.082
I guess I forgot to jump.

10:09.498 --> 10:10.742
Let's keep it down.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.538
According to my map, we're
entering an avalanche zone.

10:13.539 --> 10:16.168
The smallest peep could
cause a huge rockslide.

10:17.679 --> 10:20.276
An... an ava... ava...

10:20.277 --> 10:21.115
Shhh!

10:33.853 --> 10:35.390
AVALA...

11:07.497 --> 11:09.302
Oh no! Help!

11:15.763 --> 11:17.280
Everypony okay?

11:17.882 --> 11:19.418
Thanks to you I am.

11:23.715 --> 11:25.422
Let's do it again!

11:26.243 --> 11:29.628
This is why a girl always
packs extra accessories.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.949
Oh, please tell me I brought
a tiara that goes with this.

11:35.561 --> 11:40.179
I think we've got bigger problems than making
sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.

11:42.017 --> 11:43.094
Sorry.

11:43.095 --> 11:45.712
Oh, no big whoop, sugar cube.

11:46.001 --> 11:47.824
Yeah! We'll just have to...

11:49.375 --> 11:50.755
...climb over.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.607
My apologies.

12:10.608 --> 12:12.430
Not *your* fault.

12:17.189 --> 12:20.007
Still think it was a good idea
to bring Fluttershy along?

12:20.288 --> 12:22.004
We're about to find out.

12:23.282 --> 12:24.474
We're here.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.594
Rainbow Dash, you'll use
your wings to clear the smoke.

12:34.288 --> 12:35.759
Rarity and Pinkie Pie...

12:35.760 --> 12:39.610
...you create a diversion to distract
the dragon if things get a little hairy in there.

12:44.398 --> 12:47.741
Applejack, you're ready with
the apples in case he decides to attack.

12:51.294 --> 12:52.710
But it shouldn't come to that...

12:52.711 --> 12:55.463
...because Fluttershy will do what
she needs to do to wake him up...

12:55.464 --> 12:59.474
...and between the two of us, we should be able
to get him to understand why he needs to go.

12:59.635 --> 13:00.952
Is everypony ready?

13:04.477 --> 13:06.680
Okay then. We're going in.

13:07.784 --> 13:12.781
So, what is the best way to wake up
a sleeping dragon without upsetting him?

13:13.276 --> 13:14.245
Fluttershy?

13:14.758 --> 13:16.629
Oh, come on.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.637
Come on!

13:18.715 --> 13:19.970
We have to do this.

13:20.790 --> 13:21.812
Now!

13:22.786 --> 13:27.432
Every... second longer that dragon...
sleeps is another...

13:28.071 --> 13:32.640
...acre of Equestria that is covered in... smoke.

13:33.474 --> 13:37.663
I... I... I can't go in the cave.

13:39.029 --> 13:42.370
Oh great. She's scared of caves now too.

13:42.371 --> 13:45.427
I'm not scared of caves. I'm scared of...

13:46.080 --> 13:47.378
What's that, sugar cube?

13:47.379 --> 13:49.468
I'm scared of d...

13:50.404 --> 13:51.227
What?

13:51.228 --> 13:52.445
I'm scared of dragons!

14:01.666 --> 14:06.605
But Fluttershy. You have a wonderful
talent dealing with all kinds of animals.

14:06.849 --> 14:09.421
Yes, because they're not dragons.

14:09.623 --> 14:14.448
Oh, come on! We've seen you walk right up
to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.

14:14.548 --> 14:17.422
Yes, because he wasn't a dragon.

14:17.534 --> 14:20.223
Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him.

14:20.487 --> 14:24.483
Yes, because he's not a huge, gigantic,
terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing...

14:24.484 --> 14:27.793
...sharp-scale-having, horn-wearing,
smoke-snoring, could-eat-a-pony-in-one-bite...

14:27.794 --> 14:30.543
...totally all grown up dragon.

14:35.038 --> 14:37.504
But if you're so afraid of dragons...

14:37.505 --> 14:40.534
...why didn't you say something
before we came all the way up here?

14:40.711 --> 14:42.599
I was afraid to.

14:44.257 --> 14:46.249
All of us are scared of that dragon.

14:46.703 --> 14:47.693
I'm not.

14:48.742 --> 14:50.897
Almost all of us are scared of that dragon.

14:50.898 --> 14:52.896
But we've got a job to do.

14:52.897 --> 14:55.958
So get in there with Twilight and
show her what you're made of.

14:56.466 --> 14:58.282
I... I...

14:59.498 --> 15:00.727
I just...

15:01.231 --> 15:02.341
...can't.

15:02.342 --> 15:04.399
Oh, Fluttershy.

15:07.474 --> 15:08.622
I'm going in.

15:09.193 --> 15:11.718
He probably just doesn't
realize what he's doing.

15:12.182 --> 15:13.198
Right?

15:19.459 --> 15:20.917
Mister dragon.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.274
Excuse me.

15:31.656 --> 15:33.038
Mister dragon.

15:36.340 --> 15:38.819
Oh, good. You're awake.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.148
Please allow me to introduce myself.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.583
My name is Twilight...

15:48.268 --> 15:52.474
...Sparkle and my friends and I are
residents here in Equestria...

15:53.482 --> 15:55.217
...Ponyville to be exact.

15:55.218 --> 15:58.700
We come here to ask that you find
another spot to take your nap.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.114
It' just that you seem to be
doing an awful lot of snoring...

16:02.115 --> 16:05.044
...and every time you do, you
send out a terrible cloud of smoke...

16:07.838 --> 16:11.269
Equestria simply can't survive
a hundred years in a dark haze.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.770
You understand, don't you?

16:21.430 --> 16:23.620
So you'll find another place to sleep?

16:32.986 --> 16:36.257
So much for... persuading him.

16:37.256 --> 16:38.668
Now what?

16:39.932 --> 16:43.862
Obviously, this situation just
calls for a little "pony charm".

16:44.292 --> 16:45.752
Allow me, girls.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.827
I'm so sorry to interru-hupt...

16:50.624 --> 16:55.679
...but I couldn't possibly head back home without
mentioning what handsome scales you have.

16:56.759 --> 17:01.662
And those scales have to be hidden away
in some silly cave for a hundred years?

17:03.781 --> 17:08.779
Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing
and be out there. Showing them off.

17:09.780 --> 17:13.633
Obviously, I would be more than happy to
keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.

17:19.667 --> 17:22.142
I was this close to getting that diamond.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.723
You mean... getting rid of that dragon?

17:24.920 --> 17:27.178
Oh... yeah. Sure.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.485
What in tarnation...?

17:30.529 --> 17:32.969
Darling, you look ridiculous.

17:33.175 --> 17:34.295
Exactly!

17:34.586 --> 17:37.679
Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way
to get someone on your side.

17:37.894 --> 17:39.014
Hi!

17:42.728 --> 17:45.805
Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh.
Or sharing.

17:45.806 --> 17:47.353
Alright, that's it.

17:47.354 --> 17:49.992
We've tried persuasion, charm...

17:50.201 --> 17:52.181
...whatever it is Pinkie Pie does...

17:53.443 --> 17:55.418
It's time to stop wasting time!

17:55.419 --> 17:56.819
I'm going in.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.307
Rainbow! No!

17:59.681 --> 18:01.277
GET OUT!

18:08.352 --> 18:08.956
Sorry.

18:38.174 --> 18:39.592
How dare you?

18:40.672 --> 18:42.902
HOW DARE YOU?!

18:43.369 --> 18:45.202
Listen here, mister!

18:45.203 --> 18:48.745
Just because you're big
doesn't mean you get to be a bully.

18:48.933 --> 18:52.797
You may have huge teeth and sharp scales
and snore-smoke and breathe fire...

18:52.798 --> 18:56.937
...but you do not, I repeat, YOU DO NOT...

18:56.938 --> 18:59.073
HURT. MY. FRIENDS!

18:59.783 --> 19:01.372
You got that?

19:03.780 --> 19:05.086
Well?

19:06.300 --> 19:09.411
BUT THAT RAINBOW ONE KICKED ME.

19:11.074 --> 19:13.785
And I am very sorry about that.

19:14.650 --> 19:17.629
But you're bigger than she is
and you should know better.

19:17.829 --> 19:19.926
You should also know better
than to take a nap...

19:19.927 --> 19:23.364
...where your snoring can become
a health hazard to other creatures.

19:24.038 --> 19:24.987
BUT I...

19:24.988 --> 19:27.276
Don't you "but I" me, mister.

19:27.277 --> 19:29.925
Now what do you have to say for yourself?

19:30.541 --> 19:32.040
I said...

19:32.041 --> 19:34.841
What do you have to say for yourself?!

19:43.980 --> 19:46.576
There, there. No need to cry.

19:46.577 --> 19:50.074
You're not a bad dragon.
You've just made a bad decision.

19:50.075 --> 19:55.131
Now go pack your things. You'll just need
to find a new place to sleep. That's all.

19:57.534 --> 20:00.188
You did it! I knew you could do it!

20:14.394 --> 20:16.231
I said, come back here!

20:19.694 --> 20:22.985
How does Fluttershy put up
with you furry little things?

20:23.189 --> 20:23.967
Spike.

20:24.706 --> 20:25.692
Take a letter.

20:27.124 --> 20:28.594
With pleasure.

20:28.638 --> 20:30.164
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:30.165 --> 20:33.450
"I am happy to report that the dragon
has departed our fair country..."

20:33.550 --> 20:36.846
"...and that it was my good friend Fluttershy,
who convinced him to go."

20:37.083 --> 20:40.212
"This adventure has taught me to
never lose faith in your friends."

20:40.213 --> 20:42.726
"They can be an amazing source of strength..."

20:42.727 --> 20:45.664
"...and can help you overcome
even your greatest fears."

20:45.959 --> 20:48.926
"Always your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle."

20:49.195 --> 20:51.492
Twilight! You gotta come see this!

20:52.273 --> 20:54.767
She's just five away from a new pony record.

20:55.032 --> 20:57.254
247... 248...

20:57.954 --> 20:59.043
DRAGON!

21:04.398 --> 21:07.160
Why are you laughing?!
That awful dragon is back!

21:10.099 --> 21:12.089
Pinkie Pie, you scared me.

21:12.465 --> 21:16.653
I mean... uh, you broke my concentration.

21:18.207 --> 21:22.910
It's okay, Rainbow Dash.
Not everypony can be as brave as me.

21:30.298 --> 21:33.798
