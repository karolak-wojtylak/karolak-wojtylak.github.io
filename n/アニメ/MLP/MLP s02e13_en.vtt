00:08.406 --> 00:11.621
Can you believe the new baby is finally here?

00:11.622 --> 00:14.922
Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!

00:14.923 --> 00:17.281
I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?

00:19.196 --> 00:22.448
I wanna see the new baby pony!
I wanna see! Which one is it?!

00:23.869 --> 00:27.481
Meet our son, Pound Cake.

00:32.336 --> 00:35.553
And our daughter, Pumpkin Cake.

00:38.860 --> 00:40.958
Two new foals for me to play with?

00:40.959 --> 00:43.551
That's two, two, two times the fun!

00:43.552 --> 00:45.503
This is the greatest day ever!

00:45.504 --> 00:48.329
We need to celebrate your birthday, babies!

00:48.330 --> 00:50.646
'Cause you were just born today!

00:51.993 --> 00:54.859
Shhh. The babies are trying to sleep.

00:54.860 --> 00:56.764
- But I was just...
- Shhh.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.274
- But...
- Shhh!

01:03.041 --> 01:06.038
Happy happy birthday,
to you and you today!

01:09.342 --> 01:12.467
Now, how in thunderation is one of them twins a pegasus...

01:12.468 --> 01:14.596
...and the other one a unicorn?

01:14.597 --> 01:18.383
Easy. My great great great great
grandfather was a unicorn.

01:18.384 --> 01:22.583
And Cup Cake's great aunt's second cousin
twice removed was a pegasus.

01:22.584 --> 01:23.973
That makes sense, right?

01:23.974 --> 01:26.991
Aw yeah, just you wait!

01:26.992 --> 01:28.866
Once little Pound Cake gets his wings going...

01:28.867 --> 01:30.801
...he'll be all over the place!

01:30.802 --> 01:32.924
And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.

01:32.925 --> 01:36.375
Baby unicorns get strange magic
surges that come and go.

01:36.776 --> 01:39.111
Quick! Make a wish and
blow out your candles!

01:39.112 --> 01:40.875
Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles!

01:40.876 --> 01:44.403
- You are zero years old, after all!
- Shhh!

02:31.175 --> 02:34.776
Happy monthiversary
to you and you today!

02:34.777 --> 02:36.725
I can't believe you're already
a month old time sure flies...

02:36.726 --> 02:38.323
...it seems like only yesterday you weren't born!

02:38.324 --> 02:41.645
But now you're a month old today, hey!

02:49.135 --> 02:52.625
Are you ready for your favoritest
game in the whole wide world?

02:53.929 --> 02:56.377
Where's Pinkie Pie...?

02:56.378 --> 02:57.858
Here I am!

02:57.859 --> 03:00.535
Where's Pinkie Pie...?

03:00.536 --> 03:02.053
Here I am!

03:02.054 --> 03:05.478
Where's Pinkie Pie...?
Here I am!

03:06.709 --> 03:07.991
Here I am!

03:08.947 --> 03:10.328
Here I am!

03:10.329 --> 03:11.844
Here I am!

03:12.615 --> 03:14.320
Everything okay in there?

03:14.321 --> 03:16.734
Who needs a diaper change?

03:16.735 --> 03:19.258
Don't worry, they're fine!

03:21.326 --> 03:22.482
I mean...

03:23.465 --> 03:24.824
I got it.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.024
Is anypony hungry?

03:43.025 --> 03:45.517
No thanks.
I just had a big breakfast.

03:45.518 --> 03:46.696
I'm on it.

04:02.426 --> 04:05.360
You're making funny faces!
I have one!

04:06.735 --> 04:10.161
No, you see, Pinkie, the babies need to be burped.

04:15.269 --> 04:17.085
All set now?
Everything good?

04:17.086 --> 04:19.381
Okay, who wants to play again?

04:26.036 --> 04:29.148
Pound Cake, no pounding things.

04:35.752 --> 04:38.048
We don't chew on things, Pumpkin Cake.

04:38.049 --> 04:39.443
Except food.

04:39.744 --> 04:43.527
Food! Great cinnamon sticks,
I completely forgot!

04:43.528 --> 04:45.717
No, you just fed them bottles, remember?

04:45.718 --> 04:47.778
Not the babies' food!

04:47.779 --> 04:51.784
The food for the enormously big catering
order we have to deliver today!

04:51.785 --> 04:55.347
With the new twins, we've been so distracted!

04:55.348 --> 04:56.506
Quick, honeybun!

04:56.507 --> 04:59.972
We need to find a babysitter to watch
the foals while we take care of this.

05:00.808 --> 05:02.965
I could do it!
I wanna do it!

05:02.966 --> 05:05.095
The babies love playing with me, I'll do it!

05:05.096 --> 05:08.492
Wonder who would be available
on such short notice...

05:08.493 --> 05:10.903
Me! Me!
Pick me!

05:14.057 --> 05:16.169
I would love to babysit!

05:16.170 --> 05:18.333
But I can't today, sorry.

05:18.334 --> 05:20.679
I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic.

05:21.540 --> 05:23.605
You understand, don't you?

05:23.606 --> 05:26.358
You're not mad at me, are you?
Please don't be mad at me!

05:26.359 --> 05:28.111
I'll do it!
Pick me!

05:31.468 --> 05:33.340
I have to finish this report for the Princess...

05:33.341 --> 05:36.221
...summarizing all my other reports to the Princess.

05:37.002 --> 05:39.507
I wanna babysit!
Pick me!

05:44.579 --> 05:46.196
Babysit?
Now?

05:46.197 --> 05:49.077
When there's a swarm a' hungry
caterpillars headed this way?

05:49.078 --> 05:52.523
I gotta get all these apples picked
before they get swarmed on!

05:56.805 --> 05:58.331
I wanna do it!

06:00.079 --> 06:03.226
I got tickets to the Wonderbolts
airshow this afternoon.

06:03.227 --> 06:04.427
Gotta dash!

06:05.863 --> 06:10.502
Ask me!
Mememememememememe!

06:14.133 --> 06:16.267
Moi?
Babysit?

06:16.268 --> 06:18.260
Nononononono.

06:19.415 --> 06:21.693
I'm flattered that you would think about me though.

06:29.321 --> 06:33.977
Pinkie Pie, how would you like to babysit for us.

06:34.578 --> 06:37.784
I dunno.
I'll have to check my schedule.

06:44.514 --> 06:47.612
Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand

06:47.613 --> 06:50.662
the responsibility of watching over two babies?

06:50.663 --> 06:54.935
I can be responsible.
Why, responsibility is my middle name.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.070
Pinkie Responsibility Pie!

06:57.071 --> 06:59.963
But this time you need to take care of them.

06:59.964 --> 07:01.923
Not just play with them.

07:01.924 --> 07:04.397
You have to be responsible.

07:04.398 --> 07:08.225
Yes, I know.
I will, I am.

07:11.468 --> 07:13.105
Here you are, dearie.

07:13.106 --> 07:16.110
All your responsibilities are on this list.

07:16.111 --> 07:20.687
That's a lot of responsi...
Consider it done.

07:22.037 --> 07:24.154
We'll frost it when we get there!

07:24.155 --> 07:26.441
C'mon, sugarplum, tick tick!

07:27.570 --> 07:30.634
Take good care of our two precious little ginger snaps!

07:30.635 --> 07:33.244
No problemo, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

07:33.245 --> 07:35.516
Everything is under control.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.808
Don't cry, little friends!
Look, look!

07:57.109 --> 08:00.714
Where's Pinkie Pie?
Where's Pinkie Pie?

08:03.878 --> 08:06.477
Oh no... I'm right here, see!

08:14.219 --> 08:16.376
Think, think, think...

08:19.153 --> 08:21.228
Hey guys, watch this!

08:22.528 --> 08:25.312
Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight!

08:25.313 --> 08:26.513
Where y'all from?

08:28.647 --> 08:30.219
Well, that's great.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.839
Y'know, I used to have an ant farm,
but I had to get rid of it...

08:32.840 --> 08:36.172
...because I couldn't find tractors that small!

08:38.490 --> 08:39.778
Get it?

08:39.779 --> 08:42.628
Tractors that small?

08:44.471 --> 08:48.089
The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog.

08:48.090 --> 08:50.065
And now I can't find him!

08:55.445 --> 08:57.740
Gee, tough crowd.

08:57.741 --> 08:59.693
Tell me about it.

09:01.298 --> 09:04.131
Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper...

09:04.132 --> 09:08.085
...but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!

09:09.464 --> 09:11.606
First you wiggle your tail, oink oink oink

09:11.607 --> 09:13.565
Then you wriggle your snout, oink oink oink

09:13.566 --> 09:15.425
Then you wriggle your rump, oink oink oink

09:15.426 --> 09:17.269
Then shout it out, oink oink oink

09:17.270 --> 09:19.094
First you wiggle your tail, oink oink oink

09:19.095 --> 09:20.880
Then you wriggle your snout, oink oink oink

09:20.881 --> 09:22.571
Then you wriggle your rump, oink oink oink

09:22.572 --> 09:24.351
Then shout it out, oink oink oink

09:24.352 --> 09:25.924
First you wiggle your tail, oink oink oink

09:25.925 --> 09:27.584
Then you wriggle your snout, oink oink oink

09:27.585 --> 09:29.123
Then you wriggle your rump, oink oink oink

09:29.124 --> 09:30.765
Then shout it out, oink oink oink

09:38.468 --> 09:40.250
There, see?

09:40.351 --> 09:42.860
Nothing to this babysitting business!

09:48.180 --> 09:50.696
Snack time.
That's easy enough.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.801
Okie dokie!

09:56.044 --> 09:57.250
Eat up!

10:00.313 --> 10:01.816
Like this!

10:10.547 --> 10:14.820
No, Pumpkin Cake.
We eat food, not tablecloths.

10:23.613 --> 10:25.483
Hey guys, look at me!

10:37.330 --> 10:40.515
Yeah.... I think I can see
where this is going.

10:54.202 --> 10:56.327
Towels are not food, Pumpkin Cake!

10:57.445 --> 10:58.382
Stop it...

10:58.683 --> 10:59.683
Stop it...

11:00.484 --> 11:01.535
Stop it!

11:20.821 --> 11:22.785
Look guys, bubbles!

11:39.738 --> 11:42.851
Don't cry, look, look, floating things!

12:07.680 --> 12:09.422
Don't make me do it, guys.

12:09.423 --> 12:12.387
You know what happens when you
mix flour and water, don't you?

12:33.647 --> 12:37.569
Smells like somepony needs me
to changie-wangie their...

12:37.570 --> 12:41.703
...diaper-wiper right now-ow-ow!

12:50.388 --> 12:53.711
Easy... easy...

13:17.441 --> 13:18.859
Stand still, I've almost...

13:24.622 --> 13:27.475
You've gotta be kidding me.

13:28.454 --> 13:30.170
Thank goodness they're home!

13:31.895 --> 13:34.411
Hi!
I finished up the work I had to do...

13:34.412 --> 13:36.999
...so I thought I'd stop by and
see if you needed any help.

13:37.702 --> 13:40.478
Thank you, thank you,
thank you for coming!

13:40.479 --> 13:42.477
I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like...

13:42.478 --> 13:44.811
...I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason!

13:44.812 --> 13:48.268
And don't even get me started on
their taste in stand-up comedy.

13:48.269 --> 13:51.696
It's okay, Pinkie.
I figured you'd need some help.

13:51.697 --> 13:53.163
That's why I stopped by.

13:53.164 --> 13:54.984
Excuse me?!

13:54.985 --> 13:57.103
Babies take a lot of work.

13:57.104 --> 14:00.794
And some ponies are just not cut out
to handle the responsibility.

14:01.430 --> 14:03.404
Is that so?

14:04.335 --> 14:06.622
Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight.

14:06.623 --> 14:08.214
Sorry, I don't have time to visit.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.917
I'm very very busy with
my 'responsibilities' here.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.518
I'm happy to help!
It's no trouble.

14:16.071 --> 14:20.148
Well, she thinks I can't handle things on my own!

14:20.749 --> 14:24.032
Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own.

14:25.435 --> 14:28.769
Well, I can handle things on my own!

14:40.773 --> 14:41.830
Pound Cake.

14:42.514 --> 14:43.634
This is a crib.

14:43.635 --> 14:45.470
It is only to be used for napping, sleeping...

14:45.471 --> 14:46.690
...and on occasion with permission...

14:46.691 --> 14:48.493
...as a pretend old-timey Western fort.

14:48.494 --> 14:49.852
It is not a trampoline.

14:49.853 --> 14:52.258
So stop your jumping right now, mister!

14:54.550 --> 14:56.070
And you, young filly.

14:56.071 --> 14:57.481
We do not put anything in our mouth...

14:57.482 --> 14:59.783
...that we cannot safely and properly digest.

14:59.784 --> 15:02.590
So stop slobbering on that toy, this instant!

15:07.142 --> 15:09.753
Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon...

15:09.754 --> 15:12.557
...and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap.

15:12.558 --> 15:15.045
So, fall asleep!

15:26.510 --> 15:28.030
Sleep tight.

15:36.439 --> 15:39.543
Now that's what I call handling things.

15:49.807 --> 15:51.258
Oh, nononono.

15:51.259 --> 15:52.659
Not good, not good, not good!

15:53.512 --> 15:55.993
Pound? Pumpkin?
Where are you?

15:57.242 --> 15:59.418
Come out, wherever you are!

16:12.168 --> 16:14.862
You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin...

16:14.863 --> 16:17.914
...and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!

16:33.162 --> 16:34.786
Pound Cake?

16:35.023 --> 16:36.773
Here, Pound Cake!

16:48.073 --> 16:49.271
Pound Cake?

17:10.642 --> 17:12.084
You can fly?!

17:15.505 --> 17:20.566
Get down here, this instant, young colt!

17:23.812 --> 17:25.886
I'm responsible for you!

17:56.582 --> 17:58.976
No no no, Pumpkin.

18:02.069 --> 18:03.792
No no.

18:05.407 --> 18:06.612
No.

18:08.614 --> 18:11.688
I am the responsible one, and I said no.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.386
That goes for you too, Pound Cake!

18:25.171 --> 18:26.365
Gotcha!

18:27.061 --> 18:28.230
I think?

18:40.158 --> 18:41.882
Mhh, raspberry.

18:42.183 --> 18:48.555
I'm not letting go!
I'm responsible!

19:04.173 --> 19:06.767
Oh, not you too!

19:14.817 --> 19:18.222
There!
Now who's the responsible one?

20:06.226 --> 20:09.934
Y'know, you're right.
That is funny.

20:14.958 --> 20:17.297
"Dear Princess Celestia..."

20:17.298 --> 20:19.715
"I've always had fun playing with little kids..."

20:19.716 --> 20:22.965
"...and I thought babysitting
meant just more playtime, right?"

20:22.966 --> 20:24.166
"Wrong!"

20:24.167 --> 20:27.190
"Being a caregiver is way more responsibility..."

20:27.191 --> 20:29.068
"...than just being a playmate."

20:29.198 --> 20:33.101
"And today I learned that sometimes,
our desire for responsibility..."

20:33.102 --> 20:36.092
"...can outrun our actual ability to handle it."

20:36.475 --> 20:38.689
Pinkie Pie!
We're back!

20:38.690 --> 20:40.334
How did everything go?

20:44.796 --> 20:46.983
Are we in the right place?

20:46.984 --> 20:48.284
Shhh!

20:54.838 --> 20:58.350
Pinkie!
This is just... just...

20:58.351 --> 21:00.620
...amazing, is what it is!

21:00.621 --> 21:04.535
We had no idea how responsible you really are.

21:05.900 --> 21:11.235
Would you be interested in becoming our
go-to babysitter on a permanent basis?

21:12.943 --> 21:14.907
