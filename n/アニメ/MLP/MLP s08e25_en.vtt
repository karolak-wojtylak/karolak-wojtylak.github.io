00:14.682 --> 00:16.282
Thank you for the mail delivery!

00:16.384 --> 00:18.483
Have a wonderful day!

00:30.531 --> 00:31.998
You're new here, right?

00:33.200 --> 00:36.502
I'm Cozy Glow, Professor
Sparkle's Friendship Assistant.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.070
Welcome to our school!

00:38.872 --> 00:41.841
Your first class is
just down that hall.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.084
A seven-letter
word for teamwork...

00:52.486 --> 00:53.952
Have you tried
synergy?

00:55.489 --> 00:56.488
That's it!

00:56.590 --> 00:57.790
Thanks, Cozy!

00:58.392 --> 00:59.958
Heh. What are friends for?

01:06.267 --> 01:08.033
Good morning,
Professor Sparkle!

01:09.603 --> 01:11.470
The mail's here already?
What time is it!?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.672
I'm late for my class's
field trip to Cloudsdale!

01:16.777 --> 01:17.877
Don't worry!

01:17.979 --> 01:20.546
I asked Professor Rainbow
Dash to cover for you.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.614
And she said.. yes?

01:22.816 --> 01:24.917
Uh huh! I told her
how busy you are,

01:25.019 --> 01:27.286
and how much her
loyalty meant to you.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.089
I also color-coded your teaching
schedule by friendship element,

01:30.191 --> 01:32.858
and cataloged all the magical
artifacts in the school.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.326
I hope that's OK...

01:34.628 --> 01:37.096
OK? Cozy,
that's amazing!

01:37.198 --> 01:38.731
You're like my
right-hoof pony.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.466
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.068
[giggle]
It's like you taught me.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.737
Helping is what
friendship's all about.

01:45.839 --> 01:46.872
Exactly!

01:46.974 --> 01:48.574
And hopefully my class
is learning that

01:48.676 --> 01:50.542
on their field
trip right now.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.144
I heard they might do
some sight-seeing first.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.783
Tada!

01:57.885 --> 02:00.119
The Pegasus Weather Factory!

02:00.221 --> 02:03.722
Every drop of rain or flake of
snow from Cloudsdale

02:03.824 --> 02:05.424
comes from there!

02:05.626 --> 02:06.959
All: Whoaaa.

02:07.061 --> 02:08.028
I know, right?

02:09.030 --> 02:11.330
Hey! The cool
stuff's over here!

02:12.600 --> 02:16.335
Wow! I've never stood on
a cloud before.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.771
You can't, normally.
But for our trip,

02:18.873 --> 02:21.173
I cast a spell that lets
us walk like Pegasi.

02:23.877 --> 02:24.643
Hey Yona!

02:24.745 --> 02:26.245
Come check out this view.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.915
Unless you're too scared...

02:30.117 --> 02:31.483
Yona not scared.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.220
AHHH! NOW YONA SCARED!

03:24.338 --> 03:25.904
C'mon! We gotta catch them!

03:33.380 --> 03:34.413
Gotcha!

03:34.715 --> 03:35.847
It's OK, Yona!

03:35.949 --> 03:37.616
You like flying, remember?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.384
Flying. Not falling!

03:43.490 --> 03:44.423
I don't understand!

03:44.525 --> 03:46.725
I-I-It's like my spell
stopped working!

03:47.027 --> 03:49.461
That's.. never happened before!

03:52.833 --> 03:53.899
We have an emergency!

03:54.001 --> 03:56.201
The students dropped
out of the sky!

03:56.503 --> 03:58.003
Slow down.
What happened?

03:58.105 --> 04:00.339
I cast a spell for our
field trip to Cloudsdale.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.107
But my magic just.. failed!

04:02.209 --> 04:04.577
We barely caught
everypony in time!

04:05.279 --> 04:06.645
I'm glad you're all OK.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.847
But I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about, Starlight.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.516
Maybe you did your
spell wrong.

04:11.318 --> 04:12.384
Let's take a look.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.189
I didn't drop that book...

04:17.291 --> 04:19.324
Maybe you did
your spell wrong..?

04:20.327 --> 04:21.326
Rarity: OWWWW!

04:21.428 --> 04:23.195
Rarity ran into the door.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.698
My magic is GONE!

04:26.800 --> 04:31.203
I even had to use my
hooves to coif my tail!

04:31.705 --> 04:33.572
Still think there's
nothing to worry about?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.274
This doesn't make any sense.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.476
Magic can't just disappear!

04:37.578 --> 04:39.344
Something has to
be causing this.

04:39.746 --> 04:40.546
Um...

04:40.648 --> 04:44.216
Didn't we learn in class about
a creature that eats magic?

04:44.418 --> 04:47.452
Tir...T..Tur..something?

04:47.754 --> 04:49.488
[gasp] Tirek!

04:49.890 --> 04:52.124
Isn't he trapped in Tartarus?

04:54.528 --> 04:55.861
Spike!? What's wrong!?

05:00.501 --> 05:01.533
Whew. Thanks.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.702
I've never had a letter
get stuck before..

05:04.104 --> 05:06.305
It's from Princess Celestia!

05:06.407 --> 05:09.874
We've all been called to an
emergency meeting in Canterlot!

05:09.976 --> 05:10.742
Look!

05:12.913 --> 05:14.746
Pretty sure I know
what it's about.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.151
Celestia: Throughout our city,
ponies have been reporting

05:19.253 --> 05:21.086
tales of their magic failing.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.889
Spells going wrong,
potions not working...

05:23.991 --> 05:26.358
Even raising the moon
has become difficult.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.460
Are there similar
troubles in Ponyville?

05:28.562 --> 05:30.529
We experienced it first hoof.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.431
It's the same in my kingdom.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.600
The Crystal Heart
seems safe for now,

05:34.702 --> 05:37.435
but.. I worry if this continues.

05:41.041 --> 05:44.609
Letter for the Princesses,
from Starswirl the Bearded.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.616
Ah! It is even more
terrible than we feared.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.752
Magic is disappearing
all across Equestria.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.223
Starswirl believes the power
will drain from our land

05:58.325 --> 05:59.758
in three days.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.028
First, unicorn magic
and spells will fail.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.730
That's what's happening now!

06:04.832 --> 06:08.667
On the second day, creatures
will lose their magic abilities.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.369
[gasp] Oh, no!

06:10.771 --> 06:14.606
And finally, magical
artifacts will stop working.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.009
When the sun sets
on the third day,

06:17.211 --> 06:19.611
the magic in our
world will be gone...

06:19.713 --> 06:20.579
forever!

06:21.582 --> 06:23.683
But why is this happening now?

06:24.385 --> 06:25.550
That's the worst part.

06:25.652 --> 06:26.919
We have no idea.

06:27.121 --> 06:28.954
Has anypony checked on Tirek?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.723
You mean the big red scary
centaur who eats magic?

06:31.825 --> 06:35.926
Why would we want...
Ohhhh. Right.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.598
If he has found some way
to escape his prison,

06:39.700 --> 06:44.570
or work from within it, he
could be responsible for this.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.905
That is the best
explanation so far.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.707
Somepony should
investigate.

06:48.909 --> 06:49.674
We'll go.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.109
Oh, no no no no.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.078
Not without us you wo--

06:53.280 --> 06:55.781
Wait. Did you say "we"?

06:55.983 --> 06:57.849
I've finally learned
that it's OK

06:57.951 --> 06:59.685
to count on your
friends for help.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.153
Um...You do want
to come, right?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.722
Uh, DUH!

07:04.024 --> 07:05.190
Thank you all.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.359
We will search for ways
to protect Equestria

07:07.461 --> 07:08.694
in your absence.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.863
Be careful. Tartarus has
changed since you were there.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.399
It now holds many
dangerous creatures,

07:14.501 --> 07:16.735
and you won't be able
to rely on your magic.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.738
With her friends by her
side, she won't have to.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.743
OK. I left you my lesson
plan, all my student files,

07:24.945 --> 07:26.645
and my annotated syllabus notes.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.980
If anything goes
wrong, get Celestia.

07:29.082 --> 07:29.749
Got it.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.184
Maybe I should just
close the school

07:32.286 --> 07:33.853
and send my students home?

07:33.955 --> 07:37.056
[sigh] Would you go save
Equestria already?

07:38.058 --> 07:42.294
OK! Cozy packed us all up for a
trip to bad guy central.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.062
Don't forget
the sandwiches!

07:44.164 --> 07:45.964
I marked whose is
whose just in case.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.733
Starlight can't
stand mustard.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.335
That's so sweet
of you, Cozy.

07:50.537 --> 07:53.405
But Twilight has asked me to
stay here to run the school.

07:54.407 --> 07:57.008
Oh. I thought that after what
happened last time...

07:57.110 --> 07:58.610
Once you survive
Discord,

07:58.712 --> 08:00.445
anything else is
a piece of cake.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.782
Plus she'll have
you to help her.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.118
Oh, golly, yes!

08:06.220 --> 08:09.154
I promise I'll be the
best assistant ever!

08:09.356 --> 08:11.156
C'mon! We can start
working on your

08:11.258 --> 08:13.558
substitute Headmare plans
right now, if you like.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.428
Wow...! Uh, OK.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.767
See? Nothing to
worry about.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.935
Tell me there's
nothing to worry about.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.279
Good morning,
friendship students!

08:34.581 --> 08:37.949
I know we're all sad
Professor Sparkle is away...

08:38.151 --> 08:41.486
But don't worry, because
she left ME in charge,

08:41.588 --> 08:43.855
to do things just
the way she would!

08:44.457 --> 08:48.326
Uh. I thought Starlight Glimmer was
gonna be temporary headmare.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.862
She was. But she
left me this note:

08:51.064 --> 08:54.065
"I have to go. Twilight
needs my help."

08:54.167 --> 08:56.934
"I know the school is in
good hooves with you, Cozy."

08:57.804 --> 08:59.004
Isn't that sweet?

08:59.406 --> 09:01.506
We won't let Starlight
down, will we?

09:04.077 --> 09:06.244
It's just kinda weird, isn't it?

09:06.746 --> 09:08.247
I don't know
what you mean.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.749
Like... why'd she
change her mind?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.217
Why did Starlight
write a note,

09:12.319 --> 09:14.619
instead of say goodbye
to us herself?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.354
Doesn't make any sense.

09:19.491 --> 09:20.325
Oh, Smolder.

09:20.427 --> 09:23.194
You forget; we're
not scheming dragons.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.496
We're ponies!

09:24.698 --> 09:26.497
Sounds like somecreature
needs to do

09:26.599 --> 09:28.799
a little extra
friendship homework!

09:30.036 --> 09:31.002
Grrr.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.837
Yak not pony either.

09:32.939 --> 09:35.573
If Smolder get homework,
Yona get homework.

09:35.675 --> 09:36.574
Me too.

09:36.676 --> 09:37.342
I'm in.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.944
Yeah! Homework party!

09:41.514 --> 09:42.914
Ugh. Fine.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.515
What loyalty!

09:44.617 --> 09:47.118
Professor Rainbow Dash
would be so proud.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.053
You are such good friends.

09:49.455 --> 09:50.388
You all are!

09:50.490 --> 09:52.256
And I'm grateful
because it will be

09:52.358 --> 09:55.193
awfully hard running a
whole school alone!

09:55.295 --> 09:57.228
Can I count on each
of you to help me?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.532
Thank you so much!

10:01.634 --> 10:03.634
It's just like our
professors taught us:

10:03.736 --> 10:06.904
together, we can get
through anything!

10:12.479 --> 10:13.879
[thunk]
Owww!

10:14.081 --> 10:17.182
Ugh! I have had it with
these horrible flies!

10:17.284 --> 10:20.419
[whining] I miss my magic.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.321
Have you tried using your
tail to shoo them away?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.223
Oh! Bite your tongue!

10:25.325 --> 10:27.158
It's for decorative
purposes only.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.094
Hey, I didn't know we
packed green cupcakes!

10:31.064 --> 10:32.831
Um. We didn't.

10:32.933 --> 10:36.034
They must have gone bad without
magic to keep them cold.

10:36.936 --> 10:39.204
Magic this, magic that.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.739
We don't need magic to
go on a little hike!

10:44.744 --> 10:46.178
You were saying?

10:46.680 --> 10:49.748
You just need to think more
like Earth ponies, y'all.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.417
Granny's Apple Core
No Bite No More.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.784
That'll keep the flies off.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.589
[sniff] Ooh, it smells
just like it looks!

10:59.659 --> 11:01.259
Even if our
food's spoiled,

11:01.361 --> 11:03.428
these blueberries are
still good to eat.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.731
Too bad we can't do anything
about the rainstorm.

11:07.033 --> 11:10.401
I can't stop that storm by
myself but I can still help!

11:15.876 --> 11:18.944
I think we have all the
magic we need right here.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.746
Not that I don't
want to get it back...

11:22.048 --> 11:22.714
Let's go!

11:28.288 --> 11:30.889
Cozy Glow baked our
class cupcakes today!

11:30.991 --> 11:33.358
And she made all of us
friendship bracelets!

11:33.460 --> 11:35.393
She's the nicest
pony I've ever met.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.595
I'm SO glad
she's Headmare.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.165
Uh, temporary
Headmare, right guys?

11:41.467 --> 11:42.801
Oh, oh. Of course!

11:43.003 --> 11:46.537
But if Twilight takes her time
coming back, I won't mind.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.981
Finally! We thought you
forgot about study club!

11:57.183 --> 11:58.016
Sorry I'm late.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.052
Cozy Glow gave our class tickets
to a Sapphire Shores concert

12:01.154 --> 12:02.387
in Ponyville tonight.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.655
You get the feeling
Cozy's trying too hard

12:04.757 --> 12:05.890
to make us like her?

12:06.092 --> 12:07.692
Or maybe she just
wants to help us

12:07.794 --> 12:11.529
keep our minds off of how scary
it is that magic's disappearing.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.164
I don't trust her.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.001
What's she up to behind those
big eyes and bouncy curls?

12:18.138 --> 12:22.240
And why Cozy Pony coming out
catacombs so late at night?

12:27.847 --> 12:29.447
Let's go ask her.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.886
This is the only
door to Tartarus.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.155
The good news is, the
seal isn't broken,

12:37.257 --> 12:39.323
so we know Tirek
didn't escape.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.458
Let me guess.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.260
Ya got bad news too.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.196
Last time I was here, I had
to use magic to get in.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.665
And according to Starswirl,
all unicorn magic

12:47.767 --> 12:49.768
was gone by yesterday's sunset.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.502
Maybe he was wrong!

12:56.442 --> 12:57.775
Don't worry, Twilight.

12:57.877 --> 12:58.943
I got this!

13:01.014 --> 13:03.213
Free pizza delivery!

13:04.785 --> 13:06.317
Huh. Always worked before.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.118
Oh, well.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.721
Did any of y'all pack something
that could actually help?

13:14.594 --> 13:16.027
These all do magic,

13:16.329 --> 13:18.462
but not the kind we're
looking for, I'm afraid.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.298
How about this!

13:21.000 --> 13:22.733
The Key of Unfettered Entrance!

13:22.835 --> 13:24.435
Where did you find this, Spike?

13:24.537 --> 13:25.303
In your bag!

13:25.405 --> 13:27.105
Cozy Glow must have
packed it for you.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.707
She really did
think of everything!

13:29.809 --> 13:31.643
Um, what does it do?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.178
It can magically open any door.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.314
And since artifacts like this
haven't lost their power yet...

13:50.530 --> 13:52.129
I guess it only works once.

13:59.771 --> 14:00.738
Aaah!

14:00.840 --> 14:01.906
Cockatrice!

14:02.008 --> 14:03.641
Do something, Fluttershy!

14:03.743 --> 14:04.575
Don't look at it!

14:04.677 --> 14:06.310
It'll turn you to stone!

14:07.714 --> 14:09.147
I don't feel like stone.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.716
Unless it's really
bouncy stone.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.056
I think he lost
his magic too.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.125
All the creatures
here must have.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.132
Starswirl said that would
happen on the second day.

14:28.234 --> 14:30.468
I know it should
make me feel safer, but...

14:30.670 --> 14:32.103
it just makes me sad.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.704
We gotta fix this!

14:47.654 --> 14:49.788
Where is Princess Twilight?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.523
Oh, golly! She's
away on a quest.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.326
I'm watching the
school for her.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.228
Magic is failing
across our land,

14:57.330 --> 15:00.498
and she left a <i>foal</i>
in charge of this facility!?

15:00.800 --> 15:01.566
Yes sir!

15:01.668 --> 15:03.501
Is there anything
I can do for you?

15:03.603 --> 15:05.436
That won't be necessary.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.939
Twilight's folly stops here.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.942
As of now, <i>I</i> am Headstallion.

15:11.044 --> 15:14.112
And I have quite a
few changes to make.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.225
If all these monsters
lost their magic,

15:27.327 --> 15:30.562
then getting past Cerberus
should be easy-peasy.

15:31.832 --> 15:33.464
[footsteps]
Look out!

15:36.236 --> 15:37.568
I'll talk to him.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.973
Um, excuse me, puppy...

15:42.675 --> 15:45.042
You're a very good guard dog.

15:45.144 --> 15:46.111
Yes you are!

15:46.313 --> 15:50.281
But um, we were wondering if we
could get by to check on Tirek?

15:54.354 --> 15:55.953
That looks like a yes.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.490
I'll get you a
towel, darling.

16:07.167 --> 16:11.069
The Princess of Friendship,
here for a visit.

16:11.371 --> 16:14.672
What have I done to earn
the honor of your company?

16:14.874 --> 16:16.240
We want answers, Tirek.

16:16.342 --> 16:18.442
Magic is disappearing
from Equestria.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.178
I know.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.815
What a waste of such
[slurp] delicious power.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.754
So you are behind this!

16:29.856 --> 16:31.189
Silly filly.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.224
If I had all that magic,

16:33.326 --> 16:35.526
do you think I'd still
be locked up in here?

16:37.730 --> 16:41.399
But I might know
something about it...

16:46.306 --> 16:47.538
What are you doing!?

16:47.640 --> 16:49.841
Those are Twilight's
student files!

16:50.343 --> 16:52.844
These aren't. Not anymore.

16:52.946 --> 16:56.347
With Equestria under attack,
ponies must stand together!

16:56.449 --> 16:59.584
Twilight has endangered us all
by skipping off on

16:59.686 --> 17:03.421
"friendship trips," while these
dangerous creatures run loose!

17:03.523 --> 17:07.024
You don't think <i>they're</i> the
reason magic is disappearing,

17:07.126 --> 17:09.360
do you?
- Yes.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.229
I came to warn Twilight.

17:11.331 --> 17:15.232
But since she is gone, it falls
to me to protect you foals

17:15.334 --> 17:16.835
from those monsters.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.669
He's blaming us?

17:19.972 --> 17:21.005
Did you hear something?

17:21.107 --> 17:22.941
It sounded like it
came from over there.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.981
You again, as I suspected...

17:35.288 --> 17:38.923
From now on, this
school is <i>pony only.</i>

17:39.325 --> 17:41.759
As nature intended.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.665
Since you refuse to explain
your plot against Equestria

17:47.767 --> 17:49.634
and return the magic
you stole,

17:49.736 --> 17:52.069
you will stay here while I
summon your guardians

17:52.171 --> 17:53.404
to take you home.

17:53.806 --> 17:54.406
Wait!

17:55.908 --> 17:58.376
You were right about them from
the beginning, Chancellor.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.710
I see that now.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.179
-What are you saying!?
-Sandbar!?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.147
I don't want anything
to do with creatures

18:03.249 --> 18:04.982
that could threaten Equestria!

18:05.084 --> 18:07.518
Wisely put, colt.

18:09.556 --> 18:14.658
Everypony will come to
their senses, ...eventually.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.210
What in tarnation!?

18:32.412 --> 18:34.278
Sorry. I ran
out of apples.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.049
I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.450
My friends are in trouble!

18:39.652 --> 18:41.252
Chancellor Neighsay
locked them up!

18:41.654 --> 18:44.388
Huh? I thought Cozy
Glow was in charge.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.623
Not anymore.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.325
But you guys are good buddies.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.460
If you can convince her
to distract Neighsay,

18:49.562 --> 18:50.995
I can break out my friends.

18:51.097 --> 18:51.963
Will you help me?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.465
Do mulberries
have seeds?

18:56.035 --> 18:57.101
That's a yes.

18:59.072 --> 19:01.505
Where's Equestria's
magic going, Tirek?

19:01.707 --> 19:03.308
What's making it disappear?

19:03.610 --> 19:08.246
If you let me out, I'm sure
it would jog my memory.

19:08.748 --> 19:13.351
What do you say? I scratch
your back, you scratch mine?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.820
How 'bout you tell
us what you know,

19:15.922 --> 19:17.388
or you'll be stuck
here forever,

19:17.490 --> 19:21.292
because we're out of magic keys
and nopony can open the door?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.627
Ohh, dear. I hadn't
thought of that.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.697
We're just as
trapped as Tirek?

19:26.599 --> 19:28.499
Ha ha ha ha ha.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.867
What a pity.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.635
Well, for you.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.971
Sweet revenge for me.

19:35.808 --> 19:39.610
It seems my little protégé's
plan worked after all.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.446
Which little protégé?

19:42.748 --> 19:44.782
Oh, we've never met.

19:44.884 --> 19:45.883
We're pen pals.

19:45.985 --> 19:50.655
Each letter had so many
questions about draining magic.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.023
And you answered them!?

19:53.125 --> 19:54.525
Well, I was bored.

19:54.627 --> 19:58.362
So I simply pointed my pen
pal in the right direction.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.933
Can't you just tell us
your pen pal's name?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.704
I mean, since we're
stuck here anyway...

20:06.806 --> 20:08.539
Oh, why not.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.242
The irony is too perfect.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.245
Her name is...

20:14.547 --> 20:15.714
Cozy Glow!

20:16.216 --> 20:18.516
I could've sworn I saw
her come down this way

20:18.618 --> 20:20.050
when she left her office.

20:28.194 --> 20:31.229
Enjoying yourself
in there, Starlight?

20:31.631 --> 20:35.966
I'm sorry I had to push you
in, but what else could I do?

20:36.168 --> 20:40.138
You were going to
ruin all my plans.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.975
You might get some company soon,

20:44.277 --> 20:47.912
if I can't make that
annoying Neighsay BACK OFF.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.151
All this magic needs time to
drain from Equestria

20:54.253 --> 20:57.087
before my vortex sucks
it to another realm!

20:58.524 --> 21:01.192
Three days can sure
seem like forever, huh?

21:01.494 --> 21:04.829
You know, you ponies
got it all wrong.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.031
Friendship isn't <i>magic.</i>

21:07.133 --> 21:09.166
Friendship is POWER!

21:10.170 --> 21:13.437
With Twilight and her
lackies out of my way,

21:13.839 --> 21:17.308
all of Equestria
will bow to me...

21:17.710 --> 21:21.445
The future EMPRESS
OF FRIENDSHIP!
