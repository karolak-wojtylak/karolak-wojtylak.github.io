WEBVTT

00:11.978 --> 00:13.178
Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:13.392 --> 00:15.003
You're gonna have to
work faster than that

00:15.104 --> 00:17.515
if you plan to dig up
my whole village, lass.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.818
Let me help.

00:19.220 --> 00:19.685
Ah!

00:21.689 --> 00:24.490
Er, thank you, Rockhoof.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.259
But we're trying to
carefully preserve

00:27.461 --> 00:29.561
every bit of history here.

00:30.831 --> 00:34.666
Aye, this place is
full of memories.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.972
Did I tell you about the time
our chieftain knocked down

00:40.074 --> 00:42.875
five boulders with the
kick of a wee ball?

00:44.211 --> 00:46.511
OH! STOP THAT!

00:47.448 --> 00:49.481
But.. that's what this is for.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.283
Maybe in the past!

00:52.653 --> 00:54.586
Now, it belongs in a museum!

00:54.688 --> 00:57.423
Safe. Preserved. Untouched.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.259
Bah! Next you'll be saying
I shouldn't have used

01:00.361 --> 01:01.760
the old sweat lodge.

01:07.568 --> 01:12.004
So you see why Rockhoof isn't
an ideal fit for my team.

01:12.406 --> 01:17.009
Perhaps you could use
his, uh, <i>unusual talents</i>?

01:17.311 --> 01:18.878
Of course, Professor Fossil!

01:18.980 --> 01:21.947
We'd be honored to have a Pillar
of Equestria on our staff.

01:22.149 --> 01:23.615
Oh thank Celestia.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.021
Blech!

01:29.123 --> 01:30.823
Agh that apple's made of wood!

01:30.925 --> 01:32.558
What a horrible trick to play!

01:36.130 --> 01:39.131
Hm.  Has anypony seen my
decorative centerpieces?

01:39.233 --> 01:40.332
They were right here.

01:42.103 --> 01:42.835
Good luck!

02:24.445 --> 02:26.712
So join me in welcoming
Professor Rockhoof

02:26.814 --> 02:28.080
to our faculty!

02:32.319 --> 02:34.386
Thank you, thank you all.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.123
I know I'm new to your world,
but there's one thing I learned

02:38.225 --> 02:42.161
when I saved my village from
a rushing river of hot lava...

02:42.663 --> 02:46.831
There's nothing you can't do
with hard work... and a shovel!

02:52.005 --> 02:54.339
Except maybe stand on stage..

03:00.214 --> 03:02.748
So, um, everycreature
dismissed!

03:03.050 --> 03:04.816
We'll... see you in class!

03:06.353 --> 03:08.087
You think that new
pony is gonna be

03:08.189 --> 03:10.089
the weirdest
teacher at school?

03:10.191 --> 03:12.057
Or just one of the weirdest?

03:12.159 --> 03:13.959
Yona like new teacher!

03:14.061 --> 03:16.128
He big, like yak!

03:16.430 --> 03:18.430
And he smashes
things like a yak.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.399
He smells like a yak...

03:20.801 --> 03:23.369
Yes! He perfect.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.171
Guys, he's one
of the Pillars!

03:26.273 --> 03:28.740
He's like...
Pony history!

03:28.842 --> 03:30.709
HELLO CLASS!

03:33.280 --> 03:34.713
Well, Um...

03:34.815 --> 03:38.116
I'm er.. your new "Theory and
Defense of Friendship" teacher.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.687
But I haven't had
a chance to look

03:41.789 --> 03:43.456
at Headmare
Twilight's notes yet.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.425
What have you all
been learning?

03:45.726 --> 03:48.493
We just studied all about how
Princess Celestia and Luna

03:48.796 --> 03:51.430
used a spell to trap
Discord in stone sleep

03:51.532 --> 03:52.665
for hundreds of moons.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.866
Oh, hohoho...

03:54.968 --> 03:57.502
so it's a class
about stories, is it?

03:57.704 --> 03:59.171
Stories, yeah!

03:59.273 --> 04:01.440
And we never, ever,
ever get homework.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.376
Good! The best way to
teach colts and fillies

04:04.478 --> 04:06.178
is by experience.

04:06.580 --> 04:11.350
Like the time I was in the woods
and ran across an Ursa Major.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.517
Really!?

04:12.619 --> 04:13.852
We're not doing
that, right?

04:14.154 --> 04:15.955
You fight Ursa Major?

04:16.457 --> 04:17.889
All alone?

04:17.991 --> 04:20.760
Aye! And I
defeated her too!

04:21.262 --> 04:23.428
Now this, I'm interested in.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.597
How Professor Rockhoof win?

04:26.099 --> 04:29.768
Well, that's quite a tale.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.205
From what Professor Fossil said,
it sounds like Rockhoof

04:33.307 --> 04:35.540
just hasn't settled into
modern times yet.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.809
Our school is the
perfect place for that.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.511
Plus, we get a new teacher!

04:39.713 --> 04:42.247
Heh. This may be the fastest
friendship problem

04:42.349 --> 04:43.248
you ever solved.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.487
Dodge! Thrust! Shovel Leap!
Shovel Throw!

04:53.760 --> 04:54.660
Shovel Whack!

04:55.162 --> 04:57.462
Now you lot be the Ursa Major.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.131
Lotsa growling, mind!

05:02.235 --> 05:03.502
Ha ha ha ha!

05:05.506 --> 05:08.908
Maybe classrooms were less
breakable in the old days?

05:09.410 --> 05:11.677
Ooh ooh ooh! What
happened next?

05:11.779 --> 05:15.948
Heh heh. The huge beastie jumped
out of the moonlit mist,

05:16.250 --> 05:19.118
her fearsome fangs at my throat!

05:19.620 --> 05:20.752
But I rolled clear!

05:22.089 --> 05:23.021
Then what!?

05:24.023 --> 05:28.093
She backed me up against
a wall, ready to pounce!

05:29.096 --> 05:32.331
I looked at her...
she looked at me.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.632
And I say--

05:33.734 --> 05:34.933
Uh Professor
Rockhoof?

05:35.035 --> 05:35.934
Nope, guess again!

05:36.236 --> 05:37.736
Ahem. Oops.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.171
Sorry to interrupt.

05:39.273 --> 05:42.474
Class, why don't we go ahead
and take lunch early today?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.876
Rockhoof, can we
take a walk outside?

05:48.582 --> 05:51.450
Our school is about finding
your own special way to teach.

05:51.952 --> 05:55.754
And we can already tell
you're a smash with the class!

05:56.156 --> 06:00.259
But maybe you could do a little
less smashing in the classroom?

06:00.661 --> 06:03.795
Sorry about that. I did get
a bit carried away.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.798
The students were so
interested in my tale!

06:10.170 --> 06:11.603
I know it's a big change,

06:11.805 --> 06:13.372
but I think you're
gonna fit in just--

06:18.278 --> 06:19.611
FIRE!

06:19.713 --> 06:20.812
Rockhoof, wait!

06:20.914 --> 06:22.614
No time! The building's ablaze!

06:22.716 --> 06:24.316
We have to get everypony out!

06:24.418 --> 06:26.718
Professor Rockhoof
best teacher ever!

06:26.820 --> 06:29.087
[sigh] Day cannot get better!

06:30.557 --> 06:32.557
Let's get you
outside, wee ones!

06:33.494 --> 06:35.560
Day just got better!

06:36.284 --> 06:37.030
Wow!

06:37.731 --> 06:38.797
Ally-Oop!

06:40.200 --> 06:41.199
Rockhoof!

06:41.401 --> 06:42.501
What are you doing!?

06:42.803 --> 06:43.802
Saving the school!

06:48.675 --> 06:51.910
Just like fighting a volcano
in the good old days!

06:54.315 --> 06:56.081
Would somepony
kindly explain

06:56.183 --> 06:58.250
what is the meaning
of all this water?

06:58.352 --> 07:01.353
I'm not sure, but I
think it's "Surf's up!"

07:01.455 --> 07:03.221
Wheeeeee! Cowabunga!

07:03.323 --> 07:04.257
Sorry, Rarity.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.492
But I had to put out
the raging inferno!

07:06.994 --> 07:08.460
Inferno? Where?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.896
Did you not see the
smoke and flame?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.597
Yeah, that was us.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.799
Y'know, DRAGONS?

07:14.901 --> 07:17.235
Having a firebreathing
competition?

07:17.337 --> 07:19.104
You... what?

07:19.506 --> 07:21.006
They do it all the time.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.041
That's what we were
trying to tell you.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.677
We know you're used to
being a hero, Rockhoof.

07:26.079 --> 07:29.148
Only... what we need
here is a teacher.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.618
One who doesn't ruin an entire
class's friendship quilts!

07:33.720 --> 07:37.022
Do you know how hard it is to
stitch a pineapple pattern!?

07:38.124 --> 07:41.193
Oh. My deepest apologies.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.728
I'm not used to
living with dragons.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.131
Or much else in
this modern time.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.267
Professor Fossil
made it clear

07:48.369 --> 07:50.936
I'm not welcome back
in my old village.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.371
Seems I don't
belong here either.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.810
WHEEEE!

08:03.917 --> 08:06.418
So apparently,
finding Rockhoof a new job

08:06.520 --> 08:08.320
is a lot harder than we thought.

08:08.422 --> 08:10.389
Has anypony had any luck?

08:10.791 --> 08:13.091
Uh uh. Nope.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.230
I thought you were gonna try
him out at the post office.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.364
We did.

08:21.168 --> 08:25.003
Do you know where I can
find Cranky Doodle Donkey?

08:25.105 --> 08:27.205
I need to deliver his medicine!

08:27.307 --> 08:31.076
He has a rash in a very
embarrassing place!

08:38.285 --> 08:40.819
[shudder] I did not
need to hear that.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.356
Yep! Rockhoof's time
as a spa masseuse

08:44.458 --> 08:45.991
didn't work out either.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.929
Now just let me know if
this is too much PRESSURE.

08:56.169 --> 08:59.370
Well, at least Rockhoof's
really strong.

08:59.472 --> 09:02.774
Maybe we could find him a
job carrying heavy stuff?

09:03.076 --> 09:04.543
I tried that already!

09:04.645 --> 09:07.246
Zecora needed somepony to
help her get supplies, but...

09:11.251 --> 09:13.785
I know you said you only
needed a few leaves,

09:13.887 --> 09:15.687
but I figured why not
bring you the whole thing?

09:21.662 --> 09:23.295
Oh, how horrid.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.597
None of the other Pillars
seem to be having trouble

09:25.699 --> 09:27.466
fitting in to the modern world.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.635
Then maybe they can show
Rockhoof how they did it.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.871
Get him used to
livin' in this time.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.356
Great idea!

09:34.457 --> 09:36.440
Rockhoof's old friends
would be happy to help.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.309
And I bet he'd
love to visit them.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.415
Hmph.

09:44.117 --> 09:47.152
Even Canterlot looks
different from the old days.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.755
Aw, I'm sure once you see
your ol' pal Flash Magnus,

09:50.857 --> 09:52.257
you'll feel right at home.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.761
Trot, 2, 3, 4!
Trot, 2, 3, 4!

09:56.863 --> 09:58.864
Keep it lively, rookies!

10:00.567 --> 10:02.000
Visitors on site!

10:02.302 --> 10:03.902
Company, halt!

10:06.807 --> 10:09.474
Rockhoof, you old
ditch-digger you!

10:09.676 --> 10:12.877
Flash Magnus, as I
live and breathe!

10:12.979 --> 10:14.246
Is this your squadron?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.782
After we got out of limbo, I
went looking for work for a pony

10:17.884 --> 10:19.684
with experience in
the Royal Legion.

10:19.986 --> 10:22.387
Once a soldier,
always a soldier.

10:22.689 --> 10:25.089
Princess Celestia was happy to
find a new drill sergeant

10:25.191 --> 10:26.358
for her Guard!

10:26.460 --> 10:28.694
Yeah.. that's great.

10:29.096 --> 10:32.764
She really put you in a
job that big... so soon?

10:33.166 --> 10:34.799
Oh, this is nothing!

10:34.901 --> 10:36.768
You should see what
Mistmane is up to.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.974
They made <i>you</i> the Royal
Landscape Artist

10:43.076 --> 10:44.710
for the Crystal Empire?

10:45.012 --> 10:45.777
Wow.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.883
Your work is
beautiful!

10:48.115 --> 10:49.814
Oh thank you.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.317
I've never worked
with crystal before,

10:52.519 --> 10:56.322
but in my heart, I know
I'm where I belong.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.724
You always could find
the beauty in things.

10:59.926 --> 11:03.695
But there's not much demand for
shovel ponies like me nowadays.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.498
Don't give up hope!

11:06.800 --> 11:08.433
See Somnambula.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.302
She'll help you
find your purpose.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.307
Somnambula's a
motivational speaker.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.844
Bet they didn't even have
those back in your time.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.812
Because we didn't
need them.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.881
Ponies knew what to
do with their lives.

11:23.083 --> 11:29.421
Focus on my voice, and feel
yourself unlock your potential.

11:37.964 --> 11:43.535
Imagine everything that
troubles you as one big cloud.

11:43.637 --> 11:46.905
Now let it float away.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.107
You are relaxed.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.411
Free to do anything you wish.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.585
Guess he wished he
could take a nap?

12:03.156 --> 12:04.489
Rockhoof: Mage Meadowbrook!

12:04.591 --> 12:07.526
Your home looks just the
same as the old days.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.494
Wish I could say
the same for mine.

12:09.796 --> 12:13.231
Well, I've had to
expand my clinic a bit.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.468
Many creatures need healing
in this modern world.

12:16.970 --> 12:20.372
Oh! Looks like you
could use some too.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.074
What's got you
heartsick, Rockhoof?

12:25.745 --> 12:29.047
Thing is, I can't do
my old job like Flash.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.849
Or adapt like Mistmane.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.785
Or succeed at something
new like Somnambula.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.821
Or go home, like you.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.440
Give it time.

12:37.541 --> 12:40.858
Even Starswirl's still
learning about friendship...

12:41.161 --> 12:41.827
Applejack: Yeah!

12:42.229 --> 12:45.196
And I bet Stygian took
plenty of time to fit in.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.765
Hey, look what I found!

12:47.267 --> 12:49.768
"Me and My Shadow,"
the third hit novel

12:49.870 --> 12:51.736
by former villain Stygian!

12:51.838 --> 12:53.705
I'm impressed! He's
really thriving!

12:56.643 --> 12:58.510
Rockhoof? Where are
you going?

12:58.912 --> 12:59.962
I'm not sure.

13:00.063 --> 13:02.813
Maybe I just don't belong
in this modern world.

13:05.552 --> 13:08.319
Now this here is a
right mash of apples.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.689
'Stead of solving
Rockhoof's problem,

13:10.791 --> 13:12.557
we made him feel even worse.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.193
I'll tell you the
real problem here!

13:15.295 --> 13:19.030
We haven't given Rockhoof the
chance to be who he really is.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.867
A pony with a metal shovel
and a heart of gold?

13:22.369 --> 13:24.202
Tch. A hero!

13:24.404 --> 13:28.340
What we need to do is find him
a job that's as epic as he is!

13:28.942 --> 13:32.844
Hm. I might know
just the thing...

13:34.614 --> 13:37.415
Rockhoof: I'm honored to serve
in the Hippogriff Navy,

13:37.517 --> 13:38.683
General Seaspray.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.086
I promise I'll prove my worth.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.755
Think nothing of it.

13:43.857 --> 13:47.058
I know how hard it is
to adapt to a new home.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.961
After our many years
below the waves,

13:50.163 --> 13:53.231
land customs seemed strange.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.167
Like you didn't fit in, no
matter how hard you tried?

13:56.369 --> 13:59.504
As though the world had
moved on without us.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.372
Never fear, Rockhoof!

14:01.474 --> 14:07.779
We shall be as brothers in this
bright future above the waves.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.949
Uh, why do the
Hippogriffs need ships

14:11.051 --> 14:12.851
if they can turn
into seaponies?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.686
Maybe they just like cruises?

14:15.288 --> 14:16.038
General!

14:16.239 --> 14:18.889
The fog's too thick to see
our way out of the harbor!

14:21.761 --> 14:23.962
Heave to, swabbies!

14:24.164 --> 14:28.867
Halt the ship and hold
her till the fog passes!

14:29.469 --> 14:30.436
Wait, General!

14:30.537 --> 14:33.204
We can navigate the same way
my Coltic ancestors traveled

14:33.306 --> 14:37.309
through the Selkie Mists!
We'll look to the stars!

14:37.611 --> 14:39.244
There in the
northwest sky

14:39.346 --> 14:41.913
is the constellation
for O'Bridle's Pelt!

14:42.415 --> 14:44.416
Steer the ship toward that!

14:44.818 --> 14:46.584
You heard the pony, crew!

14:46.686 --> 14:48.153
Make full sail!

14:52.459 --> 14:55.694
Yeehaw! Rockhoof did it!

14:57.163 --> 14:59.330
But... I don't understand!

14:59.432 --> 15:01.900
The stars have always
steered me true!

15:02.102 --> 15:05.070
Oh, no. Stars can move
slowly over time.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.139
They must look different now
than over a thousand years ago.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.910
It was an honor serving
with you, Rockhoof.

15:12.212 --> 15:16.915
But it seems our paths lie
in different directions.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.322
Hey, mistakes happen.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.358
We'll think of something
else for you to do!

15:26.960 --> 15:29.027
Oh, there's no need, lass.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.162
I already know what
I want to do next.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.897
Really? What?

15:33.499 --> 15:35.333
I heard there's a
statue spell

15:35.435 --> 15:37.869
that sends creatures
into stone sleep.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.671
I want you to cast it.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.706
On me.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.579
Twilight: No!

15:48.681 --> 15:49.347
Rockhoof: Yes!

15:49.449 --> 15:50.881
-No!
-Aye!

15:52.785 --> 15:53.384
No!

15:53.486 --> 15:54.318
AYE!

15:54.520 --> 15:55.453
Hey guys.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.555
Need me to help you
decide something?

15:58.591 --> 16:01.860
Rockhoof wants me to cast a
spell to turn him into a statue.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.794
The answer is no.

16:03.896 --> 16:07.365
Well, it should be "aye", because
I wouldn't even be here

16:07.467 --> 16:08.899
to be turned into a statue

16:09.001 --> 16:12.036
if Twilight hadn't cast a
spell in the first place!

16:13.106 --> 16:16.173
Whoa. I thought you were
arguing over ice cream flavors.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.543
The answer is still no!

16:18.645 --> 16:20.545
Why would you want to
be turned into stone?

16:20.947 --> 16:23.981
Because I'm a relic
of a bygone age.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.616
I belong in a museum.

16:25.718 --> 16:26.417
Safe.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.318
Preserved.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.520
Untouched.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.822
I don't belong in this time.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.757
It's up to you to
make that right!

16:33.259 --> 16:35.126
But there has to
be a better way!

16:35.228 --> 16:37.261
Twilight, please understand.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.831
I want to be remembered
as the hero I was.

16:39.933 --> 16:42.200
Not the disappointment
I've become.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.401
But you're not!

16:43.703 --> 16:44.936
Rockhoof, wait!

16:46.139 --> 16:48.540
Spike, can you teach
my class today?

16:48.842 --> 16:51.643
Er, you're not really going to
turn him to stone, are you?

16:52.145 --> 16:53.878
Only because it's temporary.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.846
As soon as I think
of a new solution,

16:55.948 --> 16:57.348
we'll wake Rockhoof up.

16:57.450 --> 17:01.185
I KNOW he has more to offer the
world as a pony than a statue.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.223
Did you hear Rockhoof caught all
the bees in the Everfree Forest,

17:05.325 --> 17:06.924
and gave 'em to
Zecora as a gift?

17:07.126 --> 17:10.194
Wow! Terramar said Rockhoof
called down the stars

17:10.296 --> 17:12.530
and sunk the whole
Hippogriff navy!

17:12.632 --> 17:15.466
He's definitely weird.
But in a fun way.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.869
You never know what's
gonna happen next with him.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.505
Professor Rockhoof best pony!

17:21.107 --> 17:22.040
Hey, class.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.143
Welcome to the Theory and
Defense of Friendship.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.578
Another sub?

17:26.679 --> 17:29.512
Let me start by telling
you we don't get homework,

17:29.615 --> 17:31.516
and we only do field trips.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.751
Yeah, nice try.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.887
Er, Twilight sent me to tell
you she won't be in today

17:35.989 --> 17:38.856
'cause she has to cast a stone
sleep spell on Rockhoof.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.593
Like Discord? But why!?

17:42.695 --> 17:44.362
Rockhoof isn't a bad guy!

17:45.163 --> 17:45.841
Hm.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.200
Your instructions are
to write an essay on

17:49.302 --> 17:51.535
"Heroism: And What It
Means To You."

17:51.837 --> 17:53.004
No!

17:53.406 --> 17:54.338
Oh, don't worry.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.906
It doesn't have to
be a long essay.

17:57.977 --> 18:00.178
Maybe like.. this?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.713
Or on three legs... Hmm.

18:02.815 --> 18:07.018
What will give the wee birds
fewer places to uh, decorate?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.386
Yona: Professor Rockhoof!

18:08.488 --> 18:10.888
Dragon said you want
to turn into stone!

18:12.592 --> 18:14.125
Yona not believe it!

18:14.327 --> 18:17.495
Aye, I'm afraid it's true, lass.

18:17.697 --> 18:21.499
But... Pony need finish
Ursa Major story for class!

18:22.001 --> 18:25.136
It's sweet of you to try
to get me to stay, Yona.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.939
But... I'm afraid old
stories like mine

18:29.141 --> 18:31.910
aren't worth anything
in this day and age.

18:32.112 --> 18:35.113
Fine! If Pony no want
tell Yona story,

18:35.215 --> 18:37.448
then Yona tell Pony story!

18:39.786 --> 18:40.985
From class report!

18:41.087 --> 18:44.255
"When Yona come to Pony
school, Yona not fit in.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.124
Pony ways strange.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.992
But Yona find friends!

18:48.194 --> 18:50.728
Yona meet Professor Rockhoof.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.798
Pony brave and strong as Yak!

18:53.900 --> 18:55.734
Not afraid! Hero!"

18:56.236 --> 18:57.535
When Yona grow up,

18:57.637 --> 19:01.472
Yona want to be just like
Professor Rockhoof!"

19:02.374 --> 19:05.442
Well.... since you went
to the trouble

19:05.544 --> 19:08.479
of writing something
that nice, I suppose

19:08.581 --> 19:11.181
the least I could do is tell
you the rest of the story.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.821
Yona tell whole school
Rockhoof is best!

19:16.923 --> 19:18.923
Now ALL want to hear story!

19:21.628 --> 19:23.561
OK. I have the spell,

19:23.863 --> 19:26.397
but will you please
reconsider. Rockhoof!?

19:26.499 --> 19:29.667
The Ursa Major tried to
grab me by the gullet!

19:29.869 --> 19:31.135
But I ducked her claws!

19:35.007 --> 19:36.307
She had me cornered.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.143
So I look at her..
she looks at me.

19:41.281 --> 19:46.250
And I say, "Sorry you won't be
having any dinner tonight, lass!

19:46.352 --> 19:49.387
Guess you'll just have
to.. grin and bear it!"

19:50.957 --> 19:55.326
And then I tossed her away with
my shovel, high into the sky!

19:55.728 --> 19:59.663
And she's been a constellation
up there ever since.

19:59.765 --> 20:00.932
Or so I'm told.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.634
And that's the end of my story.

20:04.036 --> 20:08.072
One more story!
One more story!

20:08.174 --> 20:10.374
No no. Thank you
for listening.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.309
But it's time to say good-bye.

20:14.080 --> 20:14.780
Wait!

20:14.981 --> 20:17.781
You said there wasn't anything
in this time you were good at.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.784
What about telling stories?

20:21.621 --> 20:23.821
It was just a tall tale...

20:24.123 --> 20:26.390
One that captured the
hearts and imagination

20:26.492 --> 20:28.092
of everycreature here.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.662
Plus pony story super fun!

20:34.834 --> 20:37.868
As the Princess of Friendship,
I'd like to appoint you

20:38.070 --> 20:40.939
as Equestria's official
Keeper of Tales!

20:41.841 --> 20:43.007
Can you do that?

20:43.709 --> 20:44.342
Meh.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.778
I uh.... That's
very kind of you.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.748
But I still think these old
bones are more suited

20:50.850 --> 20:52.517
to a museum display.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.453
You are a living
record of our history.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.923
Your stories can inspire and
teach generations to come!

20:59.125 --> 21:01.693
If you're a statue,
that's all lost.

21:02.395 --> 21:05.696
But will I ever really
belong in your world?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.665
Rockhoof Yona's friend.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.167
So Rockhoof belongs.

21:10.069 --> 21:14.539
You know, that reminds
me of another story...

21:15.241 --> 21:20.411
Once there was a small Yak that
knew more than a great hero.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.614
Hey, don't forget the
dragons in this one!

21:24.016 --> 21:25.349
Aye, there were dragons!

21:25.551 --> 21:27.118
And ponies.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.353
And plenty of hippogriffs...

21:29.455 --> 21:32.123
Plus a changeling and
a griffon that flew...
