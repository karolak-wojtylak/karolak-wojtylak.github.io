WEBVTT

00:02.518 --> 00:05.122
Are you sure about this, Scootaloo?

00:05.463 --> 00:08.582
I've never even heard
of a pony zip lining before.

00:09.142 --> 00:12.187
Neither have I, but Spike told me it was awesome!

00:29.086 --> 00:30.483
See anything?

00:33.362 --> 00:36.754
Tree sap and pine needles, but no cutie mark.

00:37.206 --> 00:38.520
Plan B?

00:39.388 --> 00:42.965
Yeah. You know where we can find
a cannon at this hour?

00:45.803 --> 00:47.075
It's no use!

00:47.076 --> 00:50.516
No matter what we try, we always
end up without our cutie marks.

00:51.016 --> 00:54.097
And surprisingly often covered in tree sap.

00:54.266 --> 00:56.547
Maybe we should do something less dangerous.

00:56.548 --> 00:57.891
Like pillow testing.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.360
Or flower sniffing.

01:01.584 --> 01:04.235
This town is full of ponies,
who have their cutie marks.

01:04.236 --> 01:06.109
Why don't we ask them how they did it?

01:06.502 --> 01:08.767
That's a great *safe* idea.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.697
Yeah! And we can start with
the coolest pony in Ponyville.

01:13.189 --> 01:14.970
-Applejack!
-Rarity!

01:14.982 --> 01:17.287
Come on, guys, I said "cool"!

01:17.288 --> 01:18.705
You know who I'm talking about.

01:18.706 --> 01:20.913
She's fast. She's tough.

01:21.141 --> 01:23.009
She's not afraid of anything!

01:23.894 --> 01:25.216
Pinkie Pie?

01:25.717 --> 01:29.051
No! The greatest flyer ever
to come out of Cloudsdale.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.697
Fluttershy?

01:30.832 --> 01:33.012
No! Rainbow Dash!

01:33.480 --> 01:36.110
Oh! Yeah, that makes much more sense.

01:36.111 --> 01:37.095
Of course!

01:37.227 --> 01:40.539
Let's do it. Let's find how
Rainbow Dash earned her cutie mark!

01:40.540 --> 01:41.466
YEAH!

02:31.896 --> 02:34.102
Get back here, you thievin' vermins!

02:34.550 --> 02:35.645
Thievin' what now?

02:39.667 --> 02:40.766
Apple Bloom?

02:42.508 --> 02:44.875
Hey sis! How'd you get your cutie mark?

02:46.097 --> 02:47.741
I never told you that story?

02:48.343 --> 02:50.718
Hey! I thought we were gonna ask Rainbow Dash.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.516
We need all the help we can get.

02:53.287 --> 02:54.180
Fine.

02:55.472 --> 02:56.515
Why, shoot.

02:56.732 --> 02:58.373
I was just a little filly.

02:58.414 --> 03:00.167
Even littler than y'all.

03:01.112 --> 03:03.660
I didn't want to spend my life
at a muddy old apple farm.

03:05.006 --> 03:07.013
I wanted to live the sophisticated life.

03:07.063 --> 03:08.792
Like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange.

03:13.945 --> 03:16.581
So I set out to try my luck in a big city.

03:16.683 --> 03:17.937
Manehattan!

03:18.258 --> 03:21.035
The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria.

03:21.620 --> 03:23.585
Ey! Outta the way, you rube!

03:23.988 --> 03:27.418
I knew I'd find out who I was
meant to be in Manehattan.

03:33.628 --> 03:35.631
Aunt Orange! Uncle Orange!

03:35.632 --> 03:38.145
Thank y'all so much for lettin' me stay!

03:38.496 --> 03:41.998
"Y'all". Ahahaha...
Isn't she just the living end?

03:42.067 --> 03:43.528
How quaint.

03:43.757 --> 03:47.908
Don't worry. We'll have you acting
like a true Manehattanite in no time.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.255
And how are you finding good old Manehattan?

03:56.427 --> 03:58.335
Oh, it's simply divine.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.398
Very well said, my dear.

04:00.909 --> 04:04.251
Although, I must admit the city noise
took some getting used to.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.753
Where I'm from, nights are so quiet...

04:06.754 --> 04:09.466
...you seldom hear a peep
until the roosters wake you.

04:09.474 --> 04:10.761
The... what?

04:10.961 --> 04:14.482
I say, my dear, what
in the world is a "rooster"?

04:14.668 --> 04:16.003
What's he talking about?

04:16.197 --> 04:17.259
What do I say?

04:17.359 --> 04:19.005
I don't wanna look like a fool.

04:19.540 --> 04:21.176
Dinner is served.

04:24.436 --> 04:27.963
Thank goodness. Being a city pony's hard work.

04:27.964 --> 04:29.595
I'm so hungry I could eat a...

04:39.398 --> 04:41.662
Cock-a-doodle-doo...

04:41.663 --> 04:45.136
Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith
and Big Macintosh are up to.

04:45.744 --> 04:49.277
I bet they're applebuckin' their way
through the Red Delicious trees.

04:49.772 --> 04:52.620
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just one bite...

04:52.775 --> 04:56.143
I never felt so homesick in all my days
as I did right then.

04:59.536 --> 05:00.657
It was amazin'!

05:00.658 --> 05:04.020
A rainbow pointin' right back to... home.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.737
In that moment, it all became clear.

05:06.942 --> 05:09.492
I knew right then just who I was supposed to be.

05:16.257 --> 05:17.823
That's when this here appeared.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.573
I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since.

05:23.548 --> 05:26.796
There they are!
Get back here, ya thievin' vermins!

05:28.008 --> 05:29.779
That was such a sweet story!

05:30.242 --> 05:32.177
Sweet? Try sappy.

05:33.525 --> 05:37.396
Come on! We've got to find Rainbow Dash
and hear the cool way to get a cutie mark.

05:47.381 --> 05:50.470
All right, little ones. This way. This way.

05:52.281 --> 05:54.175
You really should be more careful.

05:54.176 --> 05:55.746
Somepony could get hurt.

05:55.846 --> 05:57.837
Why you in such a hurry anyway?

05:58.102 --> 06:01.434
We're trying to find Rainbow Dash, so we
can hear how she earned her cutie mark.

06:01.561 --> 06:03.624
Oh, that would be interesting.

06:03.625 --> 06:07.017
You know, I wouldn't have gotten
my cutie mark if it weren't for her.

06:07.253 --> 06:09.392
Rainbow Dash?! Really?!

06:09.393 --> 06:13.168
Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp.

06:13.528 --> 06:17.775
You'd never guess, but when
I was little I was very shy.

06:18.017 --> 06:20.088
And a very weak flyer.

06:39.496 --> 06:41.720
Nice going, "Klutzershy"!

06:41.721 --> 06:43.686
They oughta ground you permanently.

06:43.930 --> 06:46.745
HA! My baby brother can fly better than you!

06:46.746 --> 06:50.198
It was the most humiliating moment of my life.

06:50.199 --> 06:51.725
And then, out of nowhere...

06:56.934 --> 06:58.230
Leave her alone!

06:58.231 --> 07:01.438
Ooh, what are you gonna do, "Rainbow Crash"?

07:02.007 --> 07:04.094
Keep making fun of her and we'll find out!

07:04.262 --> 07:07.242
You think you're such a big shot?
Why don't you prove it?

07:07.442 --> 07:09.066
Whaddya have in mind?

07:12.935 --> 07:16.162
-You're going down!
-In history, maybe.

07:16.163 --> 07:18.330
See you boys at the finish line!

07:43.043 --> 07:46.263
I've never seen such beautiful creatures.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.957
Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home.

07:48.958 --> 07:51.142
And I've never been near the ground before.

07:53.557 --> 07:58.162
<i>What is this place
Filled with so many wonders</i>

07:58.163 --> 08:02.697
<i>Casting its spell
That I am now under</i>

08:02.698 --> 08:07.223
<i>Squirrels in the trees
And the cute little bunnies</i>

08:07.224 --> 08:12.190
<i>Birds flying free
And bees with their honey</i>

08:12.191 --> 08:17.300
<i>Honeeey!</i>

08:18.176 --> 08:23.954
<i>Oh, what a magical place
And I owe it all to the pegasus race</i>

08:23.955 --> 08:30.110
<i>If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve
I'd have come here sooner and never leave!</i>

08:30.111 --> 08:39.111
<i>Yes, I love everything!</i>

08:53.230 --> 08:54.522
Shhh...

08:54.752 --> 08:55.875
It's okay.

08:59.788 --> 09:01.294
You can come out.

09:05.159 --> 09:06.950
Everything's okay.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.696
There's nothing to be afraid of.

09:13.809 --> 09:18.470
Somehow I had the ability to communicate
with the animals on a different level.

09:20.844 --> 09:23.006
Wait, wait, wait. What happened to Rainbow Dash?

09:23.007 --> 09:24.441
What about the race?

09:24.442 --> 09:28.139
Oh. Well, I wasn't there so
I don't really know what happened.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.625
Come on, Crusaders. We've gotta find her.

09:30.626 --> 09:33.383
Besides, I can't take any more singing.

09:33.384 --> 09:35.507
Maybe my sister knows where she is?

09:36.464 --> 09:37.677
Bye, Fluttershy!

09:37.850 --> 09:39.043
Bye, girls!

09:43.263 --> 09:45.379
How do we get roped into this?

09:45.380 --> 09:48.948
Oh, we'll never hear Rainbow Dash's story.

09:49.117 --> 09:52.131
Are you girls still obsessing
over your cutie marks?

09:52.132 --> 09:56.308
Of course! Most other fillies
at school already have theirs.

09:56.567 --> 09:58.316
Mmm, I know how you feel.

09:58.317 --> 10:01.827
For the longest time I couldn't
figure out why I didn't have mine.

10:10.139 --> 10:13.331
Well done, Rarity. Your costumes are very nice.

10:13.484 --> 10:16.595
Nice? They need to be spectacular!

10:16.596 --> 10:18.803
And the performance is tomorrow!

10:20.219 --> 10:24.044
I tried every trick I could think of,
but nothing seemed to work.

10:24.045 --> 10:25.696
The costumes just weren't right.

10:25.697 --> 10:27.950
And the play opened that night!

10:27.951 --> 10:31.341
Maybe I'm not meant to be
a fashionista after all.

10:34.949 --> 10:36.121
What's going on?!

10:38.050 --> 10:40.723
I had no idea where my horn was taking me.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.422
But unicorn magic doesn't
happen without a reason.

10:43.590 --> 10:45.970
I knew this had to do with my love of fashion...

10:45.971 --> 10:47.887
...and maybe even my cutie mark!

10:48.757 --> 10:50.468
I knew that this was...

10:50.676 --> 10:52.476
MY DESTINY!

10:55.036 --> 10:56.344
A ROCK?!

10:56.345 --> 10:58.096
That's my destiny?!

10:58.097 --> 10:59.693
What is your problem, horn?

10:59.793 --> 11:02.684
I followed you all the way out here for a rock?!

11:03.883 --> 11:05.130
Dumb rock!

11:33.730 --> 11:34.427
Ugh!

11:34.428 --> 11:38.262
These namby-pamby stories aren't getting us
any closer to our cutie marks!

11:38.263 --> 11:42.214
They're all about finding who you really are
and boring stuff like that.

11:42.215 --> 11:44.187
Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly...

11:44.188 --> 11:48.310
Come on, girls! We need action!
We need Rainbow Dash!

11:49.081 --> 11:53.617
As a young filly in Canterlot, I've always
wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration...

11:53.618 --> 11:55.918
...where Princess Celestia raises the sun.

11:55.919 --> 11:59.631
And I saw the most amazing,
most wonderful thing I've ever seen.

12:28.754 --> 12:31.871
I poured myself into learning
everything I could about magic.

12:46.667 --> 12:51.280
My parents decided to enroll me in
Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns.

12:51.974 --> 12:53.566
It was a dream come true!

12:53.905 --> 12:55.703
Except for one thing...

12:55.704 --> 12:58.152
I had to pass an entrance exam!

13:08.706 --> 13:10.218
Well, Miss Sparkle?

13:21.183 --> 13:22.502
Well, Miss Sparkle?

13:38.450 --> 13:39.948
We don't have all day.

13:40.216 --> 13:42.649
I knew this was the most
important day of my life...

13:42.650 --> 13:46.716
...that my entire future would be affected
by the outcome of this day...

13:47.668 --> 13:49.593
...and I was about to blow it!

13:54.006 --> 13:56.307
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

14:39.121 --> 14:40.589
Twilight Sparkle.

14:40.738 --> 14:42.252
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...

14:42.253 --> 14:44.264
You have a very special gift.

14:44.265 --> 14:48.036
I don't think I've ever come across
a unicorn with your raw abilities.

14:48.037 --> 14:48.957
Huh?

14:48.958 --> 14:51.613
But you need to learn to tame
these abilities through focused study.

14:52.022 --> 14:52.659
Huh?!

14:53.059 --> 14:57.317
Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you
my own personal protege here at the school.

14:57.736 --> 14:58.587
HUH?!

14:59.235 --> 15:00.061
Well?

15:02.013 --> 15:03.287
YES!!!

15:03.288 --> 15:04.848
One other thing, Twilight.

15:05.116 --> 15:06.115
More?

15:10.523 --> 15:11.691
My cutie mark!

15:11.791 --> 15:15.824
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes
yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes...

15:15.825 --> 15:18.685
-Okay, okay.
-We're happy for you, Twilight.

15:19.241 --> 15:22.192
Yeah, thrilled. Let's get out of here
while we still can.

15:22.578 --> 15:24.985
...yesyes, YEEEES!

15:30.116 --> 15:31.533
Are you okay?

15:32.846 --> 15:35.079
Um... yes.

15:39.169 --> 15:42.763
Aaargh, why don't ever smash into Rainbow Dash?!

15:42.796 --> 15:44.259
You're looking for Rainbow Dash?

15:45.205 --> 15:47.499
If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.958
Of course, if I was anyone,
I'd be at Sugarcube Corner.

15:50.276 --> 15:52.040
Hey! I have an idea!

15:52.041 --> 15:53.498
Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?

15:54.885 --> 15:58.984
Well, we're sort of looking for Rainbow Dash,
so we can hear how she got her cutie mark.

15:58.985 --> 16:01.598
Cutie mark? Come with me
and I'll tell you how I got mine!

16:03.366 --> 16:04.512
Why not?

16:04.727 --> 16:06.236
Awright!

16:06.342 --> 16:09.686
My sisters and I were raised
on a rock farm outside of Ponyville.

16:09.721 --> 16:11.942
We spent our days working the fields.

16:11.943 --> 16:14.271
There was no talking. There was no smiling.

16:15.529 --> 16:17.345
There were only rocks.

16:19.802 --> 16:23.025
We were in the south field, preparing to
rotate rocks to the east field.

16:23.175 --> 16:24.480
Then all of a sudden...

16:34.639 --> 16:37.146
I've never felt joy like that before.

16:37.147 --> 16:40.887
It felt so good I just
wanted to keep smiling forever.

16:40.888 --> 16:43.100
And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too...

16:43.101 --> 16:45.214
...but rainbows don't come along that often.

16:45.614 --> 16:48.452
I wondered, how else could I create some smiles?

16:54.013 --> 16:57.089
We better harvest the rocks from the south field.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.565
Pinkamena Diane Pie! Is that you?

17:02.043 --> 17:05.380
Mom! I need you and dad
and the sisters to come in here. Quick!

17:13.811 --> 17:14.911
Surprise!

17:14.912 --> 17:16.314
You like it? It's called...

17:16.315 --> 17:17.677
...a party!

17:29.013 --> 17:31.043
Oh. You don't like it.

17:37.335 --> 17:38.536
You like it!

17:38.842 --> 17:40.738
I'm so happy!

17:44.062 --> 17:46.778
And that's how Equestria was made.

17:47.862 --> 17:48.744
Wha... huh?

17:48.745 --> 17:50.138
Look! We're here!

17:50.438 --> 17:53.491
Maybe on the way home I can tell you
the story of how I got my cutie mark.

17:53.492 --> 17:54.612
It's a gem!

17:56.189 --> 17:59.216
Oh, come on. She's just being Pinkie Pie.

18:04.476 --> 18:06.340
Rainbow Dash! You're here!

18:07.057 --> 18:10.008
I hear *you're* looking for my cutie mark story.

18:10.914 --> 18:15.342
You have no idea what I've been through
today to hear that story.

18:16.836 --> 18:19.089
It all happened during the race at Flight Camp...

18:19.189 --> 18:23.684
...where I stood alone against all odds
to defend Fluttershy's honor.

18:48.685 --> 18:50.658
I've never flown like THAT before.

18:50.858 --> 18:53.927
That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt.

18:53.928 --> 18:56.781
The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane...

18:56.826 --> 18:58.208
I liked it!

18:58.625 --> 19:00.383
A lot.

19:02.673 --> 19:04.813
Later, "Rainbow Crash"!

19:05.848 --> 19:06.801
Hey!

19:07.264 --> 19:10.425
Turns out the only thing
I liked more than flying fast...

19:11.997 --> 19:13.413
...was winning!

19:19.923 --> 19:23.289
Most people thought that the sonic rainboom
was just an old mare's tale.

19:23.489 --> 19:26.343
But that day... The day I discovered racing...

19:26.344 --> 19:28.834
...I proved that the legends were true.

19:29.155 --> 19:31.803
I made the impossible happen!

19:43.001 --> 19:46.945
And that, little ones,
is how you earn a cutie mark.

19:46.946 --> 19:48.683
Wooooow...

19:48.684 --> 19:49.843
Wait a second.

19:50.348 --> 19:53.456
I heard that explosion.
And I saw the rainbow too.

19:53.537 --> 19:55.753
Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals...

19:55.754 --> 19:59.010
...I never would have learned I could
communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.

19:59.011 --> 20:02.972
I heard that boom! And right afterwards there was
amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.

20:03.059 --> 20:04.413
When I got my cutie mark...

20:04.513 --> 20:06.909
...I saw a rainbow that pointed me home.

20:07.409 --> 20:09.729
I bet it was your sonic rainboom!

20:09.730 --> 20:13.345
There an explosion I could never explain,
when I got my cutie mark.

20:13.445 --> 20:14.900
This is uncanny!

20:15.000 --> 20:17.246
If that explosion didn't happen when it did...

20:17.247 --> 20:19.060
...I would have blown my entrance exam.

20:19.061 --> 20:22.769
Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me
earn my cutie mark too!

20:24.461 --> 20:27.133
We all owe our cutie marks to you!

20:27.253 --> 20:29.389
Do you realize what this means?

20:29.469 --> 20:32.519
All of us had a special connection
before we even met.

20:32.520 --> 20:36.319
We've been BFFs forever
and we didn't even know it!

20:36.419 --> 20:37.798
Come here, y'all.

20:45.269 --> 20:46.483
Gimme a break.

20:46.484 --> 20:49.884
Come on, Crusaders!
Maybe we just need to try zip lining again.

20:52.689 --> 20:54.857
Hey. How about a song?

20:57.008 --> 21:00.437
NOOOOO!

21:00.907 --> 21:02.666
"Dear Princess Celestia."

21:02.667 --> 21:04.574
"Today I learned something amazing."

21:04.575 --> 21:08.671
"Everypony everywhere has a special
magical connection with her friends..."

21:08.672 --> 21:10.711
"...maybe even before she's met them."

21:10.712 --> 21:14.204
"If you're feeling lonely and you're
still searching for your true friends..."

21:14.205 --> 21:15.983
"...just look up in the sky."

21:15.984 --> 21:21.275
"Who knows? Maybe you and your future
best friends are all looking at the same rainbow."

21:22.238 --> 21:23.330
Gross!

21:23.530 --> 21:25.317
When did you get so cheesy?

21:25.599 --> 21:27.135
Just write it, Spike.

21:30.032 --> 21:33.532
