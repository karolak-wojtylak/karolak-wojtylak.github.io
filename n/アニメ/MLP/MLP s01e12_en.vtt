WEBVTT

00:13.914 --> 00:17.591
Let's quiet down, please. We have
a very important lesson to get to.

00:18.918 --> 00:19.856
Thank you.

00:19.857 --> 00:22.682
Today, we are going to be
talking about cutie marks.

00:23.828 --> 00:25.063
Boring.

00:25.283 --> 00:27.564
You can all see my cutie mark, can't you?

00:28.130 --> 00:31.411
Like all ponies, I wasn't born with a cutie mark.

00:31.612 --> 00:33.683
My flank was blank.

00:33.688 --> 00:37.270
Awww, the's tho prethious!

00:37.505 --> 00:39.751
Then one day, when I was about you age...

00:39.752 --> 00:42.845
...I woke up to find that a
cutie mark had appeared!

00:43.164 --> 00:44.986
Look at her hair!

00:46.848 --> 00:51.383
Yes, I know. But honestly, that's how
everypony was wearing their mane back then.

00:51.638 --> 00:53.777
I had decided to become a teacher.

00:53.778 --> 00:58.226
And the flowers symbolized my hope that
I could help my future students bloom...

00:58.227 --> 01:00.091
...if I nurtured them with knowledge.

01:00.597 --> 01:05.190
The smiles represented the cheer I hoped to bring
to my little ponies while they were learning.

01:05.470 --> 01:09.267
Now, can anyone tell me when
a pony gets his or her cutie mark?

01:09.268 --> 01:10.888
Oh, oh, oh!

01:11.177 --> 01:15.141
When the dithcovers that thertain
thomething that maketh her thpecial.

01:15.142 --> 01:16.787
That's right, Twist.

01:17.128 --> 01:19.409
A cutie mark appears on a pony's flank...

01:19.410 --> 01:22.242
...when he or she finds that certain something...

01:22.243 --> 01:24.792
...that makes them different
from every other pony.

01:24.793 --> 01:28.676
Discovering what makes you unique isn't
something that happens overnight.

01:28.677 --> 01:34.133
And no amount of hoping, wishing or begging
will make a cutie mark appear before it's time.

01:35.974 --> 01:37.094
What?

01:42.167 --> 01:43.567
Apple Bloom!

01:43.835 --> 01:45.325
Are you passing a note?

01:47.426 --> 01:50.813
What could be so important that it
couldn't wait until after class?

01:52.351 --> 01:53.327
It's blank!

01:55.208 --> 01:57.184
Reminds you of anypony?

02:50.041 --> 02:52.971
Want thome thweet? I've got thome peppermint thticks.

02:53.182 --> 02:55.003
I made them mythelf.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.319
They'll make you thmile!

02:59.360 --> 03:00.593
No...

03:00.955 --> 03:04.008
I don't know why we had to sit through
a lecture about getting a cutie mark.

03:04.278 --> 03:07.631
I mean, waiting for your
cutie mark is so last week.

03:07.808 --> 03:09.270
You've got yours...

03:09.271 --> 03:10.742
...I just got mine.

03:10.819 --> 03:12.640
We all have them already.

03:13.370 --> 03:16.445
I mean, almost all of us have them already.

03:16.643 --> 03:21.325
Don't worry, you two. You're still totally
invited to my cuteceañera this weekend.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.687
It's going to be amazing.

03:23.688 --> 03:27.341
It's a party celebrating me
and my fantastic cutie mark.

03:27.342 --> 03:28.992
How could it not be?

03:29.519 --> 03:32.410
<i>Bump, bump
sugar lump rump!</i>

03:33.661 --> 03:34.967
Gimme a break.

03:35.391 --> 03:37.062
See you this weekend...!

03:38.816 --> 03:40.981
Blank Flanks!

03:45.536 --> 03:48.608
It's not fair! It's just not fair!

03:48.609 --> 03:50.600
Oh, don't get your mane in a tangle.

03:50.601 --> 03:54.089
You'll get your cutie mark.
Everypony gets one eventually.

03:54.509 --> 03:58.920
But I don't want one "eventually".
I want one right now!

03:59.148 --> 04:03.587
I can't go to Diamond Tiara's
cuteceañera without one. I just can't!

04:03.588 --> 04:05.107
'course you can!

04:05.351 --> 04:10.748
You know, I was the last pony in my class to get
a cutie mark. And I couldn't be prouder of it.

04:10.948 --> 04:15.906
I knew my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres
and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal.

04:16.521 --> 04:20.315
Come to think of it, Granny Smith
was the last one in her class too.

04:21.252 --> 04:22.760
Same with Big Macintosh.

04:22.761 --> 04:25.859
I really don't see how that's
supposed to make me feel better.

04:25.860 --> 04:30.289
That probably means that being the last one in
your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family.

04:31.114 --> 04:32.587
Runs in the family...?

04:33.156 --> 04:34.556
Runs in the family!

04:34.656 --> 04:36.310
RUNS IN THE FAMILY!

04:36.311 --> 04:38.470
You've got apples for your cutie mark...

04:38.471 --> 04:40.283
Granny Smith has an apple pie...

04:40.476 --> 04:42.554
Big Macintosh has an apple half...

04:42.678 --> 04:45.502
My unique talent must have
someth'n to do with apples!

04:45.745 --> 04:48.024
Apples! Apples! Apples!

04:51.758 --> 04:52.988
Apples.

04:55.566 --> 04:58.864
Get you delicious, nutritious apples here!

04:59.188 --> 05:03.301
Delicious and nutritious! And so many uses!

05:04.296 --> 05:05.565
You can eat 'em...

05:05.825 --> 05:07.259
Play with them...

05:09.817 --> 05:11.425
Hey, watch it!

05:12.418 --> 05:14.881
Create fine art for your home with them...

05:16.229 --> 05:19.666
You have to be crazy not to get
a bushel of your very own.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.724
She's so creative...!

05:22.725 --> 05:23.719
You, sir!

05:23.720 --> 05:25.051
Care about some apples?

05:25.151 --> 05:26.294
Uh... no thanks.

05:26.594 --> 05:27.766
Why not?

05:27.926 --> 05:29.296
I have plenty at home.

05:29.836 --> 05:30.904
Are you sure?

05:30.905 --> 05:31.789
Yes, I'm pretty sure...

05:31.790 --> 05:33.511
You're *pretty* sure.

05:33.512 --> 05:37.216
But You're not absolutely, positively
completely super-duper sure. Are you?

05:37.217 --> 05:40.656
Uh... if I buy some apples,
will you please leave me alone?

05:40.681 --> 05:41.768
Awright!

05:45.715 --> 05:47.508
You forgot your change!

05:48.555 --> 05:51.680
That's how you sell some
apples and get a cutie mark.

05:52.257 --> 05:54.508
So, what does my cutie mark look like?

05:54.509 --> 05:58.169
A shoppin' bag full of apples?
A satisfied customer eatin' an apple?

05:59.985 --> 06:02.837
Maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first.

06:03.974 --> 06:07.203
You touch it, you buy it!
We take cash or credit.

06:07.694 --> 06:09.042
I'm sorry, ma'am...

06:09.253 --> 06:10.373
Ma'am!

06:12.411 --> 06:14.924
Now, Apple Bloom, you can't just...

06:15.203 --> 06:16.625
That'll be four bits.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.650
I didn't put those in my bag!

06:18.651 --> 06:21.147
Likely story... Four bits, lady!

06:21.148 --> 06:22.384
Apple Bloom!

06:22.385 --> 06:25.528
I am really, really sorry about that. She's new.

06:25.628 --> 06:28.713
Here, take these. No charge.

06:30.216 --> 06:31.616
And these.

06:34.530 --> 06:35.930
And these.

06:38.109 --> 06:39.929
Ya'll come back, now, ya hear?

06:42.875 --> 06:43.965
What?

06:43.966 --> 06:47.125
Sorry, little sis, but your
applesellin' days are over.

06:47.421 --> 06:50.688
What?! But how else am I
gonna get my cutie mark?

06:51.192 --> 06:52.592
Home! Now!

06:56.099 --> 07:00.441
Listen, sugar cube. I know it's hard
to wait for your very own cutie mark.

07:00.442 --> 07:02.527
But you just can't force it.

07:02.831 --> 07:05.237
Besides, your not that grown up just yet.

07:05.537 --> 07:08.018
Ain't there other fillies
in your class without one?

07:08.188 --> 07:11.049
Well... Twist doesn't have hers yet.

07:11.249 --> 07:14.013
Do you think it'd feel better
if you went to the party with her?

07:14.870 --> 07:16.412
Well, there you go!

07:16.612 --> 07:19.204
Bet you and Twist will have
a great time together.

07:19.457 --> 07:21.404
Now run along and find your friend.

07:21.540 --> 07:24.621
You're sure you don't want me to stick
around till the end of the market?

07:25.070 --> 07:27.607
Hey! Who's been using my racket?!

07:28.410 --> 07:29.920
Yeah. I'm sure.

07:36.301 --> 07:38.362
Oh. What'th up, Apple Bloom?

07:38.462 --> 07:39.907
So I was thinkin'.

07:39.908 --> 07:43.147
Maybe we could go to Diamond
Tiara's cuteceañera together?

07:43.459 --> 07:46.888
I don't have a cutie mark, you
don't have a cutie mark...

07:46.889 --> 07:48.313
Well, um...

07:52.417 --> 07:54.756
Ithn't my cutie mark thwell?

07:54.757 --> 07:57.403
I've alwayth loved making
my own favorite thweets...

07:57.404 --> 08:01.474
...but it took me thome time to dithcover
that it wath my thuper thpecial talent.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.675
Pretty thweet, huh?

08:04.391 --> 08:07.723
Yeah... Pretty... sweet.

08:08.187 --> 08:12.822
Hey... This doethn't mean we can't
go to the cutetheañera together.

08:12.823 --> 08:15.687
You're thtill gonna come to the party, aren't you?

08:15.972 --> 08:17.363
Of course she will.

08:17.563 --> 08:21.875
It's not like being the only pony there
without a cutie mark would be, like...

08:21.876 --> 08:24.348
...the most embarrassing thing ever.

08:31.635 --> 08:32.814
Whoa...

08:32.914 --> 08:36.310
Looks like somepony's got a dark
cloud hanging over her head.

08:36.893 --> 08:38.847
Let me do something about that.

08:42.418 --> 08:43.763
What's the matter, kid?

08:44.768 --> 08:48.715

08:56.810 --> 08:59.379
I WANT IT NOW!

09:00.363 --> 09:03.987
Cutie mark? I can get you a cutie mark like that.

09:03.988 --> 09:06.430
Applejack says these things take time.

09:06.530 --> 09:08.859
I have to just wait for it to happen.

09:08.952 --> 09:12.462
Why wait for something to happen
when you can make it happen?

09:12.463 --> 09:14.326
But Applejack says...

09:14.327 --> 09:16.046
Hey, who are you gonna listen to?

09:16.047 --> 09:17.382
Applejack...

09:17.383 --> 09:20.527
...or the pony who was first in
her class to get a cutie mark?

09:20.528 --> 09:24.125
I always liked flying n' all but
I was going nowhere in a hurry.

09:24.126 --> 09:28.074
It wasn't until my very first race that
I discovered a serious need for speed.

09:28.329 --> 09:29.487
And KAZAM!

09:29.488 --> 09:32.386
This sweet baby appeared as fast as a lighting.

09:37.920 --> 09:38.866
That's right!

09:38.867 --> 09:42.012
Stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose.

09:42.013 --> 09:46.147
The key here is to try as many things
as possible as quickly as possible.

09:46.148 --> 09:48.358
One of them is bound to
lead to your cutie mark.

09:48.359 --> 09:49.524
Are you ready?

09:49.525 --> 09:50.679
I'm ready!

09:50.783 --> 09:51.709
I said...

09:51.710 --> 09:53.179
ARE YOU READY?!

09:53.379 --> 09:54.929
I'M READY!

09:55.069 --> 09:56.136
Jugglers, go!

10:02.185 --> 10:03.811
Hang gliding, go!

10:14.269 --> 10:15.626
Karate, go!

10:22.614 --> 10:24.061
Kite flying, go!

10:42.536 --> 10:45.416
Ultra-Pony Roller Derby, go!

11:02.641 --> 11:06.501
Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...

11:06.693 --> 11:09.894
Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party.

11:09.895 --> 11:13.153
I know. It totally shows off my new cutie mark.

11:13.154 --> 11:14.697
I love being special.

11:14.698 --> 11:18.787
Can you imagine how embarrassing
it must be to be... not special?

11:19.084 --> 11:21.807
I don't even want to, like, think about it.

11:22.490 --> 11:25.244
Tried that one... Huh, tried that one...

11:25.245 --> 11:29.569
I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find somethin' I'm good at.

11:30.612 --> 11:32.790
You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.

11:33.085 --> 11:34.803
Eatin' cupcakes?

11:34.975 --> 11:36.611
Eating cupcakes?

11:36.810 --> 11:38.668
Eating cupcakes!

11:39.813 --> 11:42.375
I really appreciate all your help, Rainbow Dash.

11:42.376 --> 11:45.139
You're really great coach and
I've learned a lot from you...

11:45.140 --> 11:47.450
...and I'm sure I can learn a lot more, but...

11:47.635 --> 11:49.743
I've got some cupcakes to eat!

11:49.854 --> 11:51.968
See you at the cuteceañera!

11:52.259 --> 11:54.719
Hold on, Pinkie Pie! I'm comin'!

11:55.905 --> 11:58.265
I can't believe I didn't think of this.

11:58.266 --> 12:02.023
A cupcake eatin' cutie mark. It's so obvious!

12:02.033 --> 12:06.251
Now, where are those cupcakes?
I'm ready to chow down!

12:06.252 --> 12:08.116
I don't have any cupcakes.

12:08.117 --> 12:09.237
Oh.

12:09.795 --> 12:12.456
But you look like you'd be good
at helping me make some!

12:12.773 --> 12:17.277
I guess, uh, "makin' cupcakes"
cutie mark could work too.

12:17.278 --> 12:21.316
<i>All you have to do is take a cup of flour,
add it to the mix.</i>

12:21.406 --> 12:25.323
<i>Now just take a little something sweet, not sour.
A bit of salt, just a pinch.</i>

12:25.625 --> 12:29.320
<i>Baking these treats is such a cinch,
add a teaspoon of vanilla.</i>

12:29.488 --> 12:33.146
<i>Add a little more and you count to four
and you never get your fill of...!</i>

12:33.199 --> 12:35.191
<i>Cupcakes, so sweet and tasty!</i>

12:35.192 --> 12:36.925
<i>Cupcakes, don't be too hasty!</i>

12:36.926 --> 12:40.521
<i>Cupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, cupcakes!</i>

12:52.815 --> 12:54.223
Hot! Hot! Hot!

12:54.909 --> 12:56.972
Those look much better than the last batch.

13:04.046 --> 13:06.609
Guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either.

13:07.383 --> 13:11.256
I just have to face it.
I'm gonna have a blank flank forever.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.077
What about that?

13:13.454 --> 13:14.587
What about what?

13:14.588 --> 13:18.176
Is there someth'n on my flank?
Is there, is there, is there?

13:21.346 --> 13:23.114
A cutie mark! It's up!

13:23.226 --> 13:25.413
A... a measuring cup? No.

13:25.414 --> 13:27.402
A mixin' bawl? No.

13:27.702 --> 13:28.950
Are those cupcakes?

13:30.169 --> 13:31.912
A tower of cupcakes, maybe?

13:33.433 --> 13:35.404
Flour! It's flour!

13:35.538 --> 13:38.427
Yay! I guessed it! What game
do you wanna play next?

13:38.428 --> 13:40.284
Please say bingo, please say bingo...

13:40.285 --> 13:43.238
Whoa...! What's been going on in here?

13:43.499 --> 13:45.598
We've been making cupcakes. Wanna try one?

13:45.798 --> 13:48.598
No, thank you. Not that they don't look...

13:50.049 --> 13:51.331
...delicious.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.861
Twilight! You have to help me!

13:53.862 --> 13:54.714

14:08.679 --> 14:11.021
...RIGHT NOW!

14:11.870 --> 14:13.690
I don't follow.

14:13.915 --> 14:15.202
How can I help you?

14:15.402 --> 14:18.280
You can use your magic to
make my cutie mark appear.

14:18.380 --> 14:19.907
Oh no, Apple Bloom.

14:20.007 --> 14:23.755
A cutie mark is something that
a pony has to discover for herself.

14:23.756 --> 14:26.177
Please, Twilight. Just try.

14:26.368 --> 14:27.191
I'm sorry, but...

14:27.192 --> 14:29.453
Oh please, please, please, please, pleeeaaase!

14:29.454 --> 14:30.463
Alright, alright.

14:30.464 --> 14:32.193
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

14:34.906 --> 14:37.234
Yes! I knew you could do...

14:37.544 --> 14:38.664
...it.

14:38.726 --> 14:41.514
I'm sorry, sweetie. But I told you...

14:41.515 --> 14:43.256
Try again! Try again!

14:58.823 --> 15:03.095
Told you that not even magic can make
a cutie mark appear before it's time.

15:03.453 --> 15:05.939
It's hopeless. Hopeless!

15:06.829 --> 15:09.944
I just won't go to the party. I can't go!

15:10.244 --> 15:13.888
Everyone will just laugh at me and
make fun of me and call me names.

15:13.889 --> 15:15.888
It'll be the worst time of my life.

15:16.284 --> 15:18.587
I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.757
Forget it. There's no way I'm going to that...

15:25.202 --> 15:26.602
...party.

15:38.839 --> 15:40.425
How could I've forgotten the time?

15:40.426 --> 15:43.471
How could I've forgotten
Pinkie Pie was hostin' the party?

15:43.472 --> 15:46.197
How could I've forgotten
it was at Sugarcube Corner?

15:46.198 --> 15:47.816
Don't forget you party hat...

15:47.817 --> 15:49.549
...Forgetty Forgetterson.

15:51.682 --> 15:54.382
I have to get out of here
before anypony sees me.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.038
Hey!

16:01.464 --> 16:03.287
It's my cuteceañera.

16:03.288 --> 16:05.682
I'm supposed to get the first bite of cake.

16:27.033 --> 16:30.709
Okay, Apple Bloom. Almost there...

16:45.905 --> 16:47.746
Apple Bloom! You made it!

16:47.747 --> 16:50.594
After I heard about Twist, I was
afraid you wouldn't show up.

16:50.595 --> 16:53.947
I sure am glad you came to your senses
about this all cutie mark thing.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.830
These things happen when these
things are supposed to happen.

16:57.030 --> 16:59.357
Tryin' to rush it will just drive you crazy.

16:59.646 --> 17:02.344
I'll let you be. Looks like your
friends want to talk to you.

17:10.764 --> 17:13.785
Well, well, well. Look who's here.

17:13.786 --> 17:15.677
Nice outfit.

17:15.987 --> 17:18.871
Just someth'n I, uh, pulled together last minute.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.004
It really shows off your cutie mark.

17:21.005 --> 17:24.103
Oh, wait. That's right. You don't have one.

17:24.364 --> 17:25.807
I have a cutie mark.

17:26.201 --> 17:27.731
What? Since when?

17:27.732 --> 17:30.476
Since, um... earlier today.

17:30.578 --> 17:32.982
Oh really? Let's see it.

17:34.909 --> 17:37.017
I shouldn't. I couldn't.

17:37.018 --> 17:40.147
My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing.

17:40.148 --> 17:42.316
I'm afraid that if I showed it off...

17:42.317 --> 17:45.338
...everyone would start paying
attention to me instead of you.

17:46.294 --> 17:48.464
Outshined at your own cuteceañera?

17:48.710 --> 17:51.639
Can you imagine how
embarrassing that would be?

17:51.823 --> 17:54.778
Uh, forget it.
I didn't really want to see it anyway.

17:54.944 --> 17:57.353
Okay! Well, I'm gonna go mingle.

17:57.354 --> 17:58.772
Enjoy your party!

18:09.886 --> 18:11.006
Oh no!

18:11.950 --> 18:15.583
Wow, that IS an amazing cutie mark.

18:16.914 --> 18:18.359
Nice try...

18:18.360 --> 18:20.013
Blank Flank!

18:23.866 --> 18:26.257
You got a problem with blank flanks?

18:27.594 --> 18:31.021
I said, you got a problem with blank flanks?

18:31.456 --> 18:34.870
The problem is, I mean, she's,
like, totally not special.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.805
No, it means she's full of potential.

18:37.934 --> 18:39.887
It means she can be great at anything.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.958
The possibilities are...

18:41.959 --> 18:43.865
..."like, endless".

18:43.954 --> 18:45.840
She could be a great scientist...

18:45.841 --> 18:47.636
...or a amazing artist...

18:47.637 --> 18:49.237
...or a famous writer.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.200
She could even be
mayor of Ponyville some day!

18:52.634 --> 18:55.468
And she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two.

18:57.279 --> 19:00.988
Hey! This is MY party,
why are you two on HER side?

19:01.329 --> 19:02.407
Because...

19:04.044 --> 19:06.147
You don't have your cutie marks either?!

19:06.247 --> 19:08.071
I thought I was the only one!

19:08.115 --> 19:10.367
We thought we were the only two.

19:10.599 --> 19:13.969
I for one think you are three very lucky fillies.

19:14.419 --> 19:17.041
Lucky? How can they be lucky?

19:17.647 --> 19:21.197
They still get to experience
the thrill of discovering who they are...

19:21.209 --> 19:22.679
...and what they're meant to be.

19:23.001 --> 19:26.082
And they've got all the time
in the world to figure it out.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.178
Not just an afternoon.

19:29.985 --> 19:33.720
-Wow, Apple Bloom.
-Do you really think you can be a mayor?
-I wish I could be a scientist.

19:33.731 --> 19:36.741
Maybe I got my cutie mark too soon?

19:36.772 --> 19:38.733
Hey, what's everypony doing?

19:38.734 --> 19:43.055
This is my party, everypony's supposed
to be paying attention to me!

19:43.691 --> 19:47.579
Whatever. We still think you're
losers. Right, Diamond Tiara?

19:48.004 --> 19:51.142
-<i>Bump, bump, sugar lump...</i>
-Not now, Silver Spoon.

19:54.959 --> 19:56.379
Name's Scootaloo.

19:56.380 --> 19:57.847
And I'm Sweetie Belle.

19:57.945 --> 19:59.334
Apple Bloom.

20:01.988 --> 20:04.961
This thong is tho thuper!

20:10.009 --> 20:12.445
So I was thinkin'. Now that we're friends...

20:12.992 --> 20:15.048
I mean, we are friends, right?

20:15.138 --> 20:17.799
How could we not be? We're totally alike.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.188
We don't have cutie marks...

20:19.189 --> 20:22.182
Diamond Tiara and Silver
Spoon drive us crazy...

20:22.215 --> 20:23.752
Totally crazy!

20:26.212 --> 20:27.605
Now that we're friends...

20:27.779 --> 20:32.045
...what if the three of us work together to find
out who we are and what we're supposed to be?

20:33.224 --> 20:35.861
We could form our own secret society.

20:35.913 --> 20:37.880
I'm liking this idea!

20:38.221 --> 20:40.524
A secret society! Yeah.

20:40.767 --> 20:42.300
We need a name for it though.

20:43.947 --> 20:45.471
The Cutie Mark Three?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.711
The Cutastically Fantastics?

20:49.162 --> 20:50.158
How about...

20:50.159 --> 20:51.739
The Cutie Mark Crusaders?

20:52.380 --> 20:53.723
It's perfect!

20:53.724 --> 20:56.517
-This is gonna be so great!
-We're gonna be unstoppable!

20:56.518 --> 20:59.708
What do you say we celebrate
with some of these delicious cupcakes?

21:00.370 --> 21:03.045
Not the cupcakes! Trust me.

21:03.211 --> 21:05.281
Let's see if there are any cookies!

21:05.309 --> 21:06.888
-Yeah!
-Come on!

21:06.889 --> 21:08.814
"Dearest Princess Celestia."

21:09.050 --> 21:11.928
"I am happy to report that
one of your youngest subjects..."

21:11.929 --> 21:14.715
"...has learned a valuable
lesson about friendship."

21:14.988 --> 21:19.228
"Sometimes the thing you think will cause
you to lose friends and feel left out..."

21:19.532 --> 21:23.189
"...can actually be the thing that
helps you make your closest friends..."

21:23.190 --> 21:25.747
"...and realize how special you are."

21:29.966 --> 21:33.466
