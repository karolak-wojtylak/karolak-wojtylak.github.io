00:11.010 --> 00:13.350
I wish the mailpony
would just come already!

00:13.500 --> 00:17.250
I can't wait another minute to find out
if Rainbow Dash got in or not!

00:17.400 --> 00:20.650
Pinkie Pie, you're more nervous
than Rainbow Dash!

00:20.800 --> 00:22.600
I'm not nervous at all!

00:22.750 --> 00:24.650
When I get into
the Wonderbolt Academy--

00:24.800 --> 00:27.050
If you get in!
If you get in!

00:27.200 --> 00:28.300
Don't jinx it!

00:28.450 --> 00:30.660
I'm telling you,
it's in the bag!

00:30.810 --> 00:31.530
Don't jinx it!

00:31.680 --> 00:33.870
She is the best flyer in Ponyville.

00:34.020 --> 00:35.500
In Ponyville?

00:37.300 --> 00:40.410
I'm probably the best flyer
in all of Equestria.

00:40.560 --> 00:41.439
I wouldn't be surprised

00:41.590 --> 00:43.340
if they just went ahead,
and made me a Wonderbolt

00:43.490 --> 00:45.290
on the first day.

00:46.150 --> 00:47.660
Got a letter here
for Rainbow Dash.

00:52.060 --> 00:53.790
I... didn't get in.

00:56.430 --> 00:57.860
Gotcha!

00:59.820 --> 01:03.490
You guys are so gullible.
Like I wasn't gonna get in!

01:04.240 --> 01:08.500
I'm just sooooooooo
happy for you!

01:09.000 --> 01:11.140
Uh... thanks?

01:13.500 --> 01:16.310
Pinkie Pie?
I kinda need to get going.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.450
Okay. I'm done!

01:21.520 --> 01:24.980
Sooner I get there,
sooner I get to show off my stuff!

01:25.950 --> 01:27.360
See you guys in a week!

01:27.510 --> 01:28.420
Good luck!

01:28.570 --> 01:30.690
Won't need it!

01:32.360 --> 01:36.280
DON'T FORGET TO WRITE!

01:40.240 --> 01:42.600
Do you think she heard me?

01:44.940 --> 01:49.940
Season 3 | Episode 7

02:44.570 --> 02:47.560
Oh yeah!
This is gonna be sweet!

02:54.170 --> 02:56.520
Well lookie what we got here.

02:58.650 --> 03:01.760
Bet y'all think you're
Wonderbolt material, don't ya?

03:01.910 --> 03:02.950
Yes ma'am!

03:04.180 --> 03:06.800
Think you got what it takes
to be an elite flyer?

03:06.950 --> 03:07.800
Yes ma'am!

03:08.180 --> 03:10.460
Well then.
Let me be the first to tell you.

03:11.230 --> 03:12.350
YOU DON'T!

03:12.500 --> 03:14.570
If you had what it took
to be an elite flyer,

03:14.720 --> 03:16.730
you'd already be
a Wonderbolt!

03:17.710 --> 03:19.520
Still think
you're something special?

03:20.970 --> 03:22.210
No ma'am!

03:30.660 --> 03:31.970
Ya think you're hot stuff?

03:34.050 --> 03:36.700
You look like you're the worst flyer
in the whole academy!

03:36.850 --> 03:39.050
You'll probably quit
after the first day!

03:39.200 --> 03:41.280
No ma'am!
I'd never quit, ma'am!

03:43.580 --> 03:44.860
What about you?

03:45.010 --> 03:48.030
Bet you couldn't fly past the
first flypole without getting winded.

03:48.450 --> 03:49.680
Try me, ma'am.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.880
What's that?

03:52.030 --> 03:54.070
Let me show you
what I've got, ma'am.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.100
You want a chance
to prove yourself, huh?

03:57.250 --> 03:58.360
Yes ma'am!

03:58.510 --> 04:00.480
Well then,
now's your chance.

04:00.630 --> 04:01.980
Give me five hundred laps!

04:02.230 --> 04:03.270
All of you!

04:04.590 --> 04:05.570
Now!

04:18.700 --> 04:21.030
Lap four-hundred and ninety-nine!

04:21.420 --> 04:23.360
One more lap to go!

04:24.770 --> 04:26.300
You're on!

04:34.130 --> 04:35.240
Five hundred!

04:38.780 --> 04:42.350
Not bad!
For a couple of newbies...

04:42.500 --> 04:44.930
- Name's Lightning Dust.
- Rainbow Dash!

04:45.080 --> 04:46.590
Wanna grab some grub
in the mess hall?

04:46.760 --> 04:47.840
Definitely.

04:55.170 --> 04:59.040
Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash hasn't
been gone twenty-four hours yet.

04:59.190 --> 05:01.040
Give her a chance
to settle in first.

05:01.290 --> 05:03.620
Why don't we just go see
what Twilight's up to?

05:03.770 --> 05:06.590
I hear Princess Celestia's got her
working on some new spells!

05:06.740 --> 05:09.390
New spells, huh?
Okay!

05:10.500 --> 05:11.210
Wait!

05:11.360 --> 05:13.520
If I'm not here when
Rainbow Dash's letter arrives,

05:13.670 --> 05:15.080
I won't be able
to read it right away.

05:15.230 --> 05:16.470
And if I don't read it right away,

05:16.620 --> 05:17.890
I won't be able to write
her back right away.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.460
And if I don't write
her back right away,

05:19.610 --> 05:20.790
she might think
I didn't get her letter

05:20.940 --> 05:22.190
and then she might worry
it got lost

05:22.340 --> 05:23.970
and if she's worried about her letter
she'll be distracted,

05:24.120 --> 05:25.920
and if she's distracted then
she won't do well at the academy,

05:26.070 --> 05:28.040
and if she doesn't do well at the academy,
then she'll get kicked out

05:28.190 --> 05:30.460
and if she gets kicked out, she'll never
be allowed to be a Wonderbolt,

05:30.610 --> 05:31.640
and if she doesn't get
to be a Wonderbolt,

05:31.790 --> 05:33.850
all her dreams
will be crushed!

05:34.000 --> 05:37.840
And it will be
all... my... FAULT!

05:39.170 --> 05:41.990
So in other words,
you're stickin' by the mailbox.

05:42.140 --> 05:42.810
Yep!

05:42.960 --> 05:44.090
Suit yourself.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.140
The Wonderbolts are the fastest,
best precision flyers in the world.

05:54.290 --> 05:56.430
But spinouts can still happen.

05:56.580 --> 05:57.630
And when they do,

05:57.780 --> 06:00.140
a Wonderbolt must
be able to recover quickly.

06:00.290 --> 06:03.310
This... is the Dizzitron.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.960
It's gonna make you very,
I repeat, very dizzy.

06:07.110 --> 06:10.120
Your task is to try and recover,
and fly straight again.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.850
As soon as possible.

06:11.990 --> 06:14.550
Once you have recovered,
you must come in for a smooth landing.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.170
Now, who's first?

06:16.650 --> 06:17.860
You.

06:18.410 --> 06:20.550
- You're up.
- Me?

06:25.730 --> 06:27.140
NOW!

06:30.170 --> 06:33.340
- Ready?
- Yes ma'am!

06:33.810 --> 06:34.400
Go!

06:45.450 --> 06:46.820
Release!

07:01.620 --> 07:03.470
Fifteen seconds.
Decent.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.060
But I wouldn't go
writin' home about it!

07:05.210 --> 07:05.770
Who's next?

07:06.450 --> 07:09.020
All right, Rainbow Dash.
Let's see what you got.

07:09.170 --> 07:10.400
Yes ma'am!

07:13.010 --> 07:14.240
Okay, go!

07:19.620 --> 07:20.450
Release!

07:27.190 --> 07:29.960
Six seconds?!
That's an academy record.

07:30.490 --> 07:32.300
You made it look so easy.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.010
I make everything look easy.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.400
Okay, Lightning Dust,
you're up.

07:37.550 --> 07:40.940
Ma'am, can you put
the Dizzitron at maximum speed?

07:41.090 --> 07:42.950
I wanna push my limits.

07:43.850 --> 07:45.200
You sure about that?

07:45.350 --> 07:46.610
Yes ma'am!

07:47.110 --> 07:49.310
Okay. You asked for it.

08:02.970 --> 08:03.920
Release!

08:11.590 --> 08:14.100
Six point five seconds.
Not bad.

08:16.700 --> 08:17.860
Next!

08:23.430 --> 08:26.260
Nopony even came close
to six seconds!

08:26.570 --> 08:29.120
They should make us
Wonderbolts right now!

08:29.270 --> 08:30.920
Yeah, they should!

08:31.070 --> 08:31.850
Listen up!

08:32.000 --> 08:34.100
For the rest of the camp,
you'll be working in pairs.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.690
Tomorrow morning,
I'll post the teams

08:35.840 --> 08:38.790
including who'll be lead pony,
and who'll be wing pony.

08:38.940 --> 08:40.370
Good luck.

08:40.810 --> 08:44.070
- Like we're gonna need it!
- Heh, yeah!

08:48.920 --> 08:52.920
So, which one of you lucky gals
gets to be my wing pony?

08:53.670 --> 08:54.400
What?

08:54.550 --> 08:56.440
You might wanna check the wall.

09:01.860 --> 09:03.950
A wing pony?

09:06.250 --> 09:09.180
They made us a team!
Isn't that awesome?

09:19.970 --> 09:21.650
Permission to enter, ma'am.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.120
What is it Rainbow Dash?

09:23.720 --> 09:27.320
I had the best time on the Dizzitron!
Only six seconds!

09:27.470 --> 09:28.660
And?

09:29.270 --> 09:30.890
And you made me a wing pony!

09:35.060 --> 09:38.170
Because I believe you and Lightning Dust
will be an unstoppable team.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.380
Do you not think
you'll be an unstoppable team?

09:40.530 --> 09:42.640
Yes ma'am!
I mean, no ma'am!

09:42.790 --> 09:46.410
I mean... We'll be
an unstoppable team, ma'am.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.720
Then what's the problem?

09:49.150 --> 09:51.680
I think I should be lead pony,
ma'am.

09:52.340 --> 09:56.450
And I think Lightning Dust likes to push
herself a little harder than you do.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.390
That's why I made her lead pony.

09:58.540 --> 10:01.700
- Got it?
- Yes ma'am.

10:01.850 --> 10:03.000
Good.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.240
Today you will all be participating
in the flag hunt.

10:19.390 --> 10:21.000
We'll divide you into two teams.

10:21.150 --> 10:23.950
Red, and blue.

10:24.100 --> 10:27.850
Whoever finds the most flags
of the opposing team's color wins.

10:29.230 --> 10:31.470
Oh, this is gonna be
so much fun!

10:31.620 --> 10:34.510
If you think this is going to be fun,
you are sadly mistaken.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.400
This is for training purposes.

10:36.550 --> 10:37.930
This is not recess.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.830
Lead ponies and wing ponies
must fly together.

10:40.980 --> 10:44.420
If any pair splits apart,
they will be immediately disqualified.

10:45.910 --> 10:47.380
Do you understand?

10:47.530 --> 10:48.640
Yes ma'am!

10:48.790 --> 10:50.406
Then let's go!

10:57.770 --> 11:00.250
- Ready to rock and roll?
- Ready.

11:13.100 --> 11:16.130
- You spotted any flags yet?
- Not yet.

11:16.620 --> 11:17.900
Oh! There's one!

11:18.380 --> 11:19.970
Good eye!

11:20.120 --> 11:21.400
We should slow down.

11:21.550 --> 11:24.270
It doesn't look like both of us
can make it at this speed!

11:33.560 --> 11:36.490
Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash
found the first flag!

11:38.740 --> 11:41.020
Come on!
Let's find some more!

11:41.170 --> 11:44.100
Uh, sure.
Just give me a second.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.630
Oh, you're fine.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.500
Yeah... totally.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.490
She's still at it.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.850
I just wish we could help her!

12:06.000 --> 12:06.610
Help me?

12:06.750 --> 12:09.900
The only thing that could possibly help me
is a letter from Rainbow Dash!

12:10.050 --> 12:11.520
It's been three days already.

12:11.670 --> 12:14.670
Right now, she probably doesn't
even know our names anymore!

12:14.820 --> 12:17.290
She probably can't
remember our faces!

12:17.440 --> 12:19.630
"Pinkie Pie?
I never heard of a Pinkie Pie!"

12:19.780 --> 12:21.450
"Who is Pinkie Pie?"

12:22.060 --> 12:25.630
If you're so worried, then
why don't you send her a letter first?

12:26.110 --> 12:28.850
'Course!
That's a great idea!

12:30.260 --> 12:32.410
Oh wait!
I got an even better idea!

12:32.560 --> 12:35.200
How about we send Rainbow Dash
a care package?

12:35.350 --> 12:37.200
You know,
before she forgets all about us?

12:37.350 --> 12:39.250
Although, come on,
let's face it.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.910
It's probably too late for that.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.020
But, maybe it'll jog
her memory somehow!

12:43.170 --> 12:47.460
Pinkie Pie, I'm sure Rainbow Dash still
remembers our faces and who we are.

12:47.610 --> 12:50.520
But I think sending her
a care package is a great idea!

12:50.670 --> 12:53.780
A care package it is!
We'll send it through the mail!

12:54.270 --> 12:56.450
WAIT! Ah!
That won't work at all!

12:56.600 --> 12:57.550
Why not?

12:57.750 --> 13:00.110
Because what if the package
gets lost in the mail?

13:00.250 --> 13:02.030
What if somepony else
gets the package by accident

13:02.180 --> 13:04.060
and then she remembers us
instead of Rainbow Dash

13:04.210 --> 13:05.400
and then she becomes
our new friend,

13:05.550 --> 13:07.400
and then the real Rainbow Dash
wouldn't ever know that

13:07.550 --> 13:09.910
she used to have friends
and she forgot them!

13:10.250 --> 13:11.960
Is anypony else following this?

13:13.100 --> 13:14.700
I've got it!

13:14.850 --> 13:17.540
We'll deliver the care package
to Rainbow Dash in person!

13:17.700 --> 13:19.750
- I wouldn't mind a little trip.
- I'll go!

13:19.900 --> 13:21.710
- Count me in!
- Me too!

13:21.860 --> 13:22.660
Me five!

13:22.810 --> 13:24.820
But don't be upset if
she doesn't recognize you at first.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.390
It may take a while for her
to get her memory back.

13:38.020 --> 13:40.810
Today we'll be doing
our famous air obstacle course.

13:42.810 --> 13:45.750
The object of this exercise
is to work on your precision flying

13:45.900 --> 13:47.770
under extreme circumstances.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.480
And don't worry about winning.
It's not a race.

13:53.670 --> 13:55.830
Now everypony,
get on your marks!

14:20.980 --> 14:23.490
Ugh, can't they go any faster?

14:24.180 --> 14:26.600
It's no good,
I can't get around them!

14:26.750 --> 14:27.650
It doesn't matter!

14:27.800 --> 14:31.910
We can still fly completely in sync
and blow Spitfire's mind with our moves!

14:32.540 --> 14:33.370
I guess...

14:46.250 --> 14:48.340
What are they,
a couple of snails?

14:48.490 --> 14:49.680
It's just a little weather.

14:53.490 --> 14:55.950
Now's our chance
to pass these slowpokes!

15:09.530 --> 15:12.000
Not bad!
And in record time, too!

15:12.150 --> 15:15.570
Definitely made the right decision
making you two a team.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.910
The others seem
to have had a little trouble

15:18.060 --> 15:19.750
with the precision part
of the exercise.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.250
I'd better go help
sort them out.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.560
Why don't you two
go hit the mess hall early?

15:23.700 --> 15:24.670
Yes ma'am!

15:25.560 --> 15:26.430
Thank you ma'am!

15:26.870 --> 15:29.260
Um, Lightning Dust?

15:29.410 --> 15:32.720
Next time, maybe we don't
cut the other teams off like that?

15:32.870 --> 15:34.730
Hey, you snooze, you lose!

15:34.890 --> 15:38.860
Besides, Wonderbolts are supposed
to be able to recover from a spinout.

15:39.010 --> 15:42.430
You saw them on the Dizzitron!
They could use the practice.

15:42.580 --> 15:46.090
I mean, it's not our fault we're
so much better than those other guys!

15:46.240 --> 15:48.830
Not every pony is destined
to become a Wonderbolt.

15:48.980 --> 15:51.170
Only the best of the best, right?

15:51.620 --> 15:54.890
Yeah, I guess you're right...

15:55.040 --> 15:58.150
'Course I'm right!
Now let's go fuel up.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.650
Kicking all that tail
has made me hungry.

16:26.140 --> 16:27.620
Yeah!

16:35.890 --> 16:40.900
I have an idea about how we can
literally blow away our competition.

16:43.310 --> 16:45.090
But we're already way ahead.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.770
Are you in, or not?

16:46.920 --> 16:50.000
<i>Lightning Dust likes to push herself
a little harder than you do.</i>

16:50.150 --> 16:52.150
<i>That's why I made her lead pony.</i>

16:53.620 --> 16:55.080
I'm in!

16:55.230 --> 16:56.680
Follow my lead!

17:07.040 --> 17:08.460
I can't control it!

17:21.450 --> 17:23.000
It's a twister!

17:24.980 --> 17:26.740
Hold on!

17:35.050 --> 17:36.920
Noooooo!!

18:06.650 --> 18:08.120
Are you guys okay?

18:10.650 --> 18:11.550
Pinkie Pie!

18:14.830 --> 18:17.250
You... remember me!

18:17.400 --> 18:19.720
Well... yeah,
of course I remember you.

18:19.870 --> 18:21.740
But what are you all doing here?

18:21.890 --> 18:23.970
We wanted to bring you
a care package.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.410
Didn't realize you'd be in the middle
of some crazy tornado drill.

18:27.550 --> 18:30.140
That... was... awesome!

18:30.290 --> 18:31.330
Awesome?

18:31.480 --> 18:33.710
My friends could have been
smashed to pieces!

18:34.180 --> 18:36.980
Yeah, but they weren't, right?

18:37.130 --> 18:38.880
Can't say the same for the clouds.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.420
We totally wiped them out
with that tornado.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.550
The other cadets will have
to be up there for days

18:43.700 --> 18:44.990
to bust as many as we did.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.400
A hoof bump?
Seriously?

18:49.550 --> 18:51.030
You made me clip my wing,

18:51.180 --> 18:54.260
you sent half of our class into serious
tail spins on the obstacle course,

18:54.410 --> 18:58.030
you unleashed a tornado
that nearly demolished my friends!

18:58.180 --> 18:59.670
Yeah? And?

18:59.820 --> 19:02.250
And I get that
you wanna be the best.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.210
So do I!

19:03.540 --> 19:05.840
But you're going about it
in the wrong way.

19:05.990 --> 19:08.570
The Wonderbolts
don't seem to think so.

19:08.720 --> 19:12.790
After all, Spitfire did make me
the leader and you the wing pony.

19:15.050 --> 19:18.450
You're right. She did.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.630
This better be important.

19:22.050 --> 19:24.550
You're supposed to be up there
busting clouds with your partner.

19:24.700 --> 19:25.860
We're done with that, ma'am.

19:26.010 --> 19:28.230
Already?
That's an academy record!

19:28.380 --> 19:29.810
Explain your methods.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.340
That's why I'm here ma'am.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.630
Lightning Dust decided to use
a tornado.

19:33.780 --> 19:35.630
A bit excessive for cloud-busting.

19:35.780 --> 19:38.980
But judging from your time,
it was obviously an effective tactic.

19:39.130 --> 19:42.710
Yeah, well that "effective tactic"
nearly took out my friends!

19:42.860 --> 19:44.370
No disrespect ma'am,

19:44.520 --> 19:47.710
but there's a big difference between
pushing yourself as hard as you can,

19:47.860 --> 19:49.480
and just being reckless.

19:49.630 --> 19:52.430
And if being reckless is what
gets rewarded around here,

19:52.580 --> 19:54.700
if that's what it means
to be a Wonderbolt,

19:54.850 --> 19:56.890
then I don't want any part of it.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.590
What are you saying, newbie?

20:00.880 --> 20:01.900
I quit.

20:11.090 --> 20:12.590
You did what?

20:12.740 --> 20:15.450
Being a Wonderbolt
was your dream!

20:15.600 --> 20:17.320
Not anymore.

20:17.470 --> 20:21.160
Sorry, Rainbow Dash.
I know how much this meant to you.

20:23.510 --> 20:24.690
Rainbow Dash!

20:25.590 --> 20:29.030
How dare you storm out of my office
without giving me a chance to respond!

20:29.630 --> 20:32.510
The Wonderbolts are looking for
the best flyers in Equestria.

20:32.660 --> 20:33.460
You were right,

20:33.610 --> 20:36.370
being the best should never come
at the expense of our fellow ponies.

20:36.520 --> 20:39.050
It's not just about
pushing ourselves.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.860
It's about pushing ourselves
in the right direction.

20:42.010 --> 20:44.640
You've shown that
you're capable of doing just that.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.400
You're no wing pony,
Rainbow Dash...

21:01.470 --> 21:02.950
you're a leader.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.700
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!

21:10.170 --> 21:12.510
Now get out there
and give me twenty!

21:12.660 --> 21:14.200
Yes ma'am!

21:25.950 --> 21:26.580
Wait!

21:26.730 --> 21:29.650
You didn't even get to open
your care package!
