WEBVTT

00:06.438 --> 00:08.307
Oh, thank you so
much for helping me

00:08.409 --> 00:09.609
with these flyers, Spike.

00:10.044 --> 00:13.713
I'm so lucky you just happened
to be walking past the boutique.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.215
Er, yeah, right...

00:16.417 --> 00:18.283
just "happened to
be walking past... "

00:18.585 --> 00:19.118
Ha-ha...

00:22.323 --> 00:23.421
What'cha got here?

00:23.623 --> 00:25.521
"Lost dog?" "Balloons for sale?"
"Guitar lessons?"

00:25.723 --> 00:29.060
'Cause I found one, I need
some and yes, I am interested.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.401
No, it's a call for submissions.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.569
Fashion contest
I'm organizing.

00:37.671 --> 00:40.272
A showcase for aspiring
young designers.

00:41.074 --> 00:41.974
Oh, wow!

00:42.109 --> 00:43.409
What an awesome idea.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.342
Thank you.

00:45.044 --> 00:47.779
I remember how difficult it
was to break into the fashion

00:47.881 --> 00:49.515
industry when I
was starting out.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.883
That's why the winner
of the contest

00:51.985 --> 00:54.820
will get to debut their line
in the Carousel Boutique!

00:55.722 --> 00:57.423
So selfless.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.491
So generous.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.794
I've also managed to get
esteemed fashion critic

01:02.896 --> 01:06.665
Hoity Toity and iconic fashion
photographer Photo Finish

01:06.767 --> 01:09.068
to come to Ponyville
and judge the show.

01:09.370 --> 01:14.073
And, wait until you hear who
else will be a judge!

01:14.275 --> 01:15.507
Countess Coloratura?

01:16.009 --> 01:16.975
Sassy Saddles?

01:17.277 --> 01:17.910
Spike?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.046
No....

01:20.448 --> 01:23.949
The third judge for the Carousel
Boutique's Couture du Futur

01:24.051 --> 01:26.618
Fashion Contest is
none other than...

01:27.120 --> 01:28.354
Applejack!

01:28.756 --> 01:29.455
What!?

01:29.757 --> 01:30.622
What!?

01:31.124 --> 01:31.858
What!?

01:33.260 --> 01:34.293
What?

02:13.166 --> 02:13.965
What?!

02:14.267 --> 02:15.634
You already said
that, darling.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.636
I know. But I had
to say it again

02:17.738 --> 02:19.738
because that's how
confused I am.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.508
You want me to judge
a fashion show?

02:22.810 --> 02:25.277
I'm sure Rarity has her
reasons and once we hear them,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.146
all of this will make sense.

02:27.448 --> 02:30.549
I admit, Applejack is
an unorthodox choice.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.652
But that is precisely what
makes her an inspired choice.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.287
See? Now it all...

02:36.990 --> 02:38.457
still doesn't make any sense.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.560
Hoity Toity has expertise
in fabric and stitchwork.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.563
Photo Finish has an artistic
eye for shapes and colors.

02:44.865 --> 02:48.133
But sometimes we designers
forget about practicality!

02:48.335 --> 02:50.136
That's where you come in.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.839
Uh, I think I might be a
little too "practical."

02:53.941 --> 02:56.742
My closet's nothing but
twenty versions of this hat.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.511
Which tells me you're a pony
who knows what she likes.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.780
Besides, a judge
must be honest

03:01.882 --> 03:04.049
and you're the most
honest pony there is.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.951
Ask any pony,
they'll tell you.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.820
Ooh! Let me try!

03:08.222 --> 03:08.820
'Scuse me.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.456
Have you ever
heard of Applejack?

03:10.658 --> 03:12.391
The most honest
pony there is?

03:12.593 --> 03:13.392
Sure have.

03:14.194 --> 03:14.860
See?

03:15.362 --> 03:16.462
So, what do you say?

03:17.064 --> 03:19.264
Well, if I'm bein' honest...

03:19.466 --> 03:21.716
I don't think I'm the
right pony for the job.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.735
Fashion just ain't
my bag of oats.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.738
Aw Booooooo!

03:26.640 --> 03:28.574
I do understand
your hesitation.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.343
But before you say
no, sleep on it?

03:31.645 --> 03:32.812
Sure.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.014
I guess I can do
that for you.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.125
Yeah I know, Big Mac!

03:46.327 --> 03:48.227
I was just as surprised
as you are.

03:49.762 --> 03:53.665
I mean, can you imagine
me judgin' a fashion show?

03:56.836 --> 03:57.835
I'd do it!

03:57.937 --> 04:00.806
It sounds like fun getting to
see all those pretty outfits.

04:01.308 --> 04:03.842
Well, you're the exception
in our family, sugar cube.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.645
You know about
that kind of stuff.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.047
I'd be as useful as a burr
knot on a sapling tree.

04:11.785 --> 04:16.889
Although, Rarity did say I just
had to focus on practicality.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.790
She already has
experts for the...

04:19.192 --> 04:20.292
fashion-y stuff.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.062
But I still wouldn't
know what to say.

04:28.835 --> 04:31.670
Come on, Apple Bloom, you're
doubling our workload here.

04:32.372 --> 04:33.239
Sorry.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.807
I wanted to wear a
signature hat like yours,

04:35.909 --> 04:38.077
but it's making
it harder to see.

04:38.279 --> 04:40.279
That's because
it's not like mine.

04:41.714 --> 04:43.849
You don't need a fancy
scarf to keep your hat on.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.317
Now you can see.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.254
Hyah!

04:50.556 --> 04:52.624
Wow! That is a lot better.

04:53.026 --> 04:53.993
Thanks, Applejack.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.261
Sure thing.

04:55.963 --> 04:56.861
You know what?

04:56.963 --> 04:59.598
I am gonna help
Rarity judge her show.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.501
I think my sensible,
everypony take on fashion

05:02.603 --> 05:04.870
is exactly what the pony
community needs.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.973
Rarity, I thought
about it some more

05:08.375 --> 05:10.943
and if you still need me,
I'd love to be a judge.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.613
Oooo, I just knew
you'd come around!

05:16.215 --> 05:17.749
I, Photo Finish...

05:17.951 --> 05:19.418
have arrived!

05:19.620 --> 05:21.687
As has Hoity Toity.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.823
It's wonderful to see you!

05:24.925 --> 05:25.490
Kiss.

05:25.692 --> 05:26.224
Kiss.

05:26.326 --> 05:26.860
Kiss!

05:27.326 --> 05:29.428
Thank you both so
much for doing this!

05:31.899 --> 05:35.801
We missed you at Miss Pommel's
debut in Manehattan last week.

05:36.303 --> 05:37.936
Miss Pommel is showing?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.172
I thought she was
still making costumes.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.272
You haven't heard?

05:41.474 --> 05:43.942
Everypony who is anypony
is talking about it.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.547
Oh, my.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.516
They're absolutely stunning.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.986
It sure is great to hear
Miss Pommel is doing so well.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.055
Who is this
who speaks?

05:56.457 --> 05:58.156
Oh, this is Applejack.

05:58.458 --> 05:59.758
Another one of the judges.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.460
So, judge.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.728
What do you think?

06:03.996 --> 06:05.598
Oh, wow...

06:06.500 --> 06:07.699
that is just...

06:07.901 --> 06:08.600
wow.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.335
These are clothes?

06:11.771 --> 06:13.205
The photo is upside-down.

06:14.407 --> 06:15.808
This is...

06:16.110 --> 06:18.610
she looks like a disco ball.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.913
Did..did they have to roll
her down the runway?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.316
Ha ha ha!

06:24.118 --> 06:27.419
I can't believe anypony
would actually wear this!

06:28.221 --> 06:29.188
Am I right?

06:29.590 --> 06:31.490
Oh, my!

06:31.692 --> 06:32.392
I faint!

06:33.994 --> 06:37.162
Ha ha.. uh.. so funny.

06:42.835 --> 06:45.470
Oh, gosh, I didn't
mean to make her faint.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.906
Oh, don't worry
about it, darling.

06:48.008 --> 06:48.874
Happens all the time.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.646
Besides, that dress did look
a bit like a disco ball.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.382
Although, Miss Pommel
is making the point

06:57.684 --> 06:58.882
that no matter what we wear,

06:58.984 --> 07:01.653
it is a costume of
some kind or another.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.323
I have no idea what
you're talkin' about.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.057
And that's OK!

07:06.459 --> 07:08.660
Let's go meet the
designers and help them

07:08.762 --> 07:10.061
get ready for the show!

07:12.431 --> 07:13.531
De-signers!

07:13.733 --> 07:14.731
Welcome!

07:15.133 --> 07:18.603
Today you will work on your
designs and we judges will offer

07:18.705 --> 07:22.107
our guidance and advice as you
prepare for tomorrow's big show!

07:27.080 --> 07:29.447
Lily Lace, tell us
about your inspiration.

07:30.749 --> 07:31.483
You guys.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.083
This morning on my way here?

07:33.185 --> 07:36.087
I heard a bird singing literally
the most beautiful song

07:36.189 --> 07:38.122
I'd ever heard and
I wanted to capture

07:38.224 --> 07:39.958
not so much the
bird's song exactly?

07:40.060 --> 07:43.362
But more like how the wind
carried the bird's song.

07:44.064 --> 07:48.099
Powerful, yet at the same
time fragile and delicate.

07:49.502 --> 07:50.735
Uh.. Huh?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.404
Next up, meet Starstreak.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.842
I'm not interested in
what's already been done,

07:58.244 --> 08:01.446
only what will
exist in the future.

08:03.949 --> 08:07.118
Tomorrow's fashion belongs
to those who hear it coming.

08:11.223 --> 08:13.358
I am Inky Rose.

08:18.797 --> 08:20.565
You have a very focused vision.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.068
A strong sense of
what you want is good!

08:23.570 --> 08:25.820
Applejack, you've
been rather quiet.

08:26.072 --> 08:27.138
What do you think?

08:28.841 --> 08:30.942
Well, it's a lot of black.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.577
It's kind of...

08:32.979 --> 08:33.845
depressing.

08:37.249 --> 08:38.049
How's this?

08:38.585 --> 08:40.852
Makes a world of difference!

08:41.354 --> 08:43.455
Maybe to fashion
experts like you,

08:44.157 --> 08:47.058
but to ponies like
me, it's still black.

08:47.460 --> 08:51.496
And I'm not sure how you wear
singing birds or the future.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.872
I don't think they
liked what I had to say.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.672
Ah well, that's why you're here.

09:03.074 --> 09:05.477
Fashion needs a healthy dose
of practicality now and then.

09:12.117 --> 09:14.185
Are you puttin' holes
in the clothes...

09:14.287 --> 09:15.253
on purpose?

09:15.455 --> 09:17.422
It's to create a
distressed look.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.724
More like an "old
and tattered" look.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.093
When a pony's old
clothes get holes in 'em,

09:22.395 --> 09:25.163
they don't want to go to the
store to buy new clothes...

09:25.265 --> 09:25.963
with holes in 'em.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.399
OK, yes, not a very
practical choice.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.702
Fashionable, but
not practical.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.308
Simply stunning!

09:37.110 --> 09:40.712
Sure it looks pretty, but
that's a lot of fabric.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.347
With the way it drags behind,

09:42.749 --> 09:44.499
it'll be covered in
dirt in no time.

09:44.751 --> 09:45.849
Thank goodness I'm here.

09:46.051 --> 09:49.120
Otherwise we'd've had holes
in clothes and dirty dresses.

09:55.227 --> 09:58.663
But of course, no look is complete
without mane and make-up!

09:59.265 --> 10:01.867
So er.. when are you
gonna do her mane?

10:02.669 --> 10:04.803
Uh! It's already been done!

10:05.505 --> 10:06.503
You know what?

10:07.005 --> 10:08.839
I think we've given the
designers enough guidance

10:08.941 --> 10:09.508
for today.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.477
Let's.. uh.. let them
finish their work.

10:13.079 --> 10:15.514
Can't wait to see what ya'll
do for the big show tomorrow!

10:24.824 --> 10:25.524
Hey, Applejack!

10:25.600 --> 10:26.098
On your way home?

10:26.258 --> 10:27.726
How'd the first day
of the contest go?

10:28.528 --> 10:29.426
Great!

10:29.528 --> 10:31.763
At first, I didn't
think I'd be much help,

10:32.065 --> 10:33.932
but thank goodness I signed on!

10:34.134 --> 10:37.702
Without me, they'd be doin' all
kinds of crazy fashiony things!

10:40.973 --> 10:41.571
Hey, Rarity.

10:41.673 --> 10:43.471
Applejack says the
contest is going great!

10:43.573 --> 10:44.843
Good thing she's
there, huh?

10:45.045 --> 10:46.077
Yes. Of course.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.647
Some of her thoughts
are tough to swallow,

10:49.049 --> 10:51.716
but hopefully her candor
will help the designers

10:51.818 --> 10:53.552
achieve the best
designs possible.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.686
You seem a
little stressed.

10:56.088 --> 10:56.754
Wanna try?

10:56.856 --> 10:58.657
Music is very relaxing!

10:59.559 --> 11:00.159
Sure.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.467
Ah, much better.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.080
I can meet my goals!

11:22.482 --> 11:24.049
Today is a fresh start!

11:24.851 --> 11:26.651
Good morning, everypony!

11:27.153 --> 11:29.620
Time for final adjustments
before the show!

11:31.824 --> 11:35.794
If buttons could convey
sadness, you've done it.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.930
To me, they convey
waking up an hour early

11:39.032 --> 11:40.231
just to button them all!

11:40.433 --> 11:42.083
And that's if you could
reach most of 'em.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.475
Is this better?

11:52.211 --> 11:53.178
There ya go.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.880
Now when it's cold, you just
slide it on ya and you're set.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.148
Like a poncho.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.485
Umm. "Poncho?"

12:05.691 --> 12:08.326
I attached each
feather individually, haha.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.461
It took me for literally ever.

12:12.431 --> 12:16.301
Oh, you used hoof-crossed
double-over stitches!

12:17.503 --> 12:18.903
They're perfect!

12:19.005 --> 12:20.838
Who cares if it's
stitched perfectly?

12:20.940 --> 12:22.373
You don't need
feathers on your head.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.714
My little sister tried to add
some flair to her hat

12:30.016 --> 12:31.314
and guess what it got her?

12:31.416 --> 12:34.452
An extra hour of work pickin'
apples off the ground.

12:40.292 --> 12:42.893
A good start, but.. it needs more.

12:45.064 --> 12:45.663
No...

12:46.565 --> 12:47.164
No...

12:47.833 --> 12:48.432
No...

12:49.801 --> 12:50.769
Yes!

12:51.071 --> 12:53.171
I'd go with this one.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.672
No! This one!

12:57.644 --> 12:58.776
Something is funny?

12:58.978 --> 13:01.145
What? Oh, no.
It's just...

13:01.247 --> 13:03.448
I mean, those belts
look the same.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.050
That one completely
changes the look.

13:06.352 --> 13:07.953
This one compliments it.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.255
You're kidding, right?

13:10.957 --> 13:12.223
Is everything OK?

13:12.825 --> 13:16.260
They're having a heated
debate about those two belts.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.064
Oooh, both good choices.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.333
No! There is no choice!

13:22.435 --> 13:24.235
They're the exact same belt!

13:24.737 --> 13:26.270
This is so silly!

13:26.372 --> 13:28.406
Fashion is ridiculous!

13:30.076 --> 13:31.109
You don't mean that.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.209
I do.

13:32.611 --> 13:35.447
I'm sorry but that's
my honest opinion.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.416
Well, I never
would have come

13:38.518 --> 13:41.185
if I knew we were
going to be insulted!

13:43.288 --> 13:44.055
We go!

13:45.390 --> 13:47.359
No, please! Come back!

13:48.361 --> 13:50.428
If they're out, I'm out too.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.063
I didn't get into
fashion to design boring,

13:53.165 --> 13:54.566
utilitarian clothes.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.969
I want to create
elegance and drama?

13:58.071 --> 14:00.205
And this is lit'rally
the opposite of...

14:00.607 --> 14:02.640
I mean, I can't even...

14:04.810 --> 14:06.410
Yeah, no.

14:12.285 --> 14:12.917
What?

14:13.319 --> 14:14.652
I was just bein' honest!

14:21.494 --> 14:23.061
Stop everything!

14:23.363 --> 14:24.562
There is no show!

14:24.764 --> 14:26.330
Take it all down!

14:27.899 --> 14:29.233
Rarity, what's going on?

14:29.335 --> 14:30.501
Is everything OK?

14:30.703 --> 14:31.502
No!

14:31.604 --> 14:33.238
It is the opposite of OK.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.840
The judges have quit; the
designers have dropped out;

14:35.942 --> 14:37.308
the show is cancelled!

14:37.510 --> 14:39.710
All my good
intentions, squashed!

14:42.782 --> 14:45.283
And it's all Applejack's fault!

14:45.685 --> 14:47.251
Why are you mad at me?

14:47.353 --> 14:48.854
I was just sayin'
what I thought.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.989
And isn't that why you
wanted me to be a judge?

14:52.191 --> 14:53.057
For my honesty?

14:53.559 --> 14:54.457
Of course.

14:54.559 --> 14:57.095
But you said fashion
is ridiculous!

14:57.697 --> 14:59.230
But it's my opinion!

14:59.332 --> 15:00.731
And I'm not gonna lie!

15:01.155 --> 15:01.655
Oh!

15:02.133 --> 15:03.201
Come with me!

15:09.374 --> 15:10.975
Oh, heh heh, Rarity!

15:11.277 --> 15:12.744
What a nice surprise!

15:13.146 --> 15:16.114
Hello Strawberry Sunrise,
this is Applejack.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.049
I was wondering if you could
tell her how you feel

15:18.151 --> 15:19.084
about apples?

15:19.686 --> 15:20.718
Don't like 'em!

15:21.120 --> 15:22.387
What? Why?

15:22.589 --> 15:25.256
They're crunchy, they're
sweet, they're delicious.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.358
They're not strawberries.

15:29.494 --> 15:30.393
You're right.

15:30.795 --> 15:33.298
Apples are better
than strawberries.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.001
Only if by "better" you mean
"better at being disgusting."

15:38.103 --> 15:39.904
You'd better apologize!

15:40.406 --> 15:41.404
Oh, I'm sorry...

15:41.506 --> 15:43.441
that you actually bite
into those tasteless,

15:43.543 --> 15:45.009
mealy, worm-filled things.

15:45.033 --> 15:45.433
Oh..

15:47.445 --> 15:48.146
What!?

15:50.450 --> 15:51.182
Applejack!

15:51.284 --> 15:52.450
Why are you so angry?

15:52.652 --> 15:55.186
It's just Strawberry's
honest opinion.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.222
What's wrong with that?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.257
Well, that's fine if
she doesn't like 'em,

15:59.459 --> 16:02.193
but if she knew how hard we
work to make our apples perfect,

16:02.495 --> 16:06.965
maybe she wouldn't be so
mean about it--Oooooh.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.099
Oh, boy.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.434
Mmm-hmm.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.135
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

16:11.637 --> 16:12.403
No.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.439
No, it does not at all.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.909
I am so sorry, Rarity.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.478
I got so carried away
with bein' honest,

16:20.680 --> 16:23.581
I guess I didn't think about
how I was makin' others feel.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.117
I'm a real rotten apple.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.486
I appreciate that, Applejack.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.620
That means a lot.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.289
I just wish you'd realized it

16:31.391 --> 16:33.357
before you ruined
the fashion show!

16:39.465 --> 16:41.365
I need to get some of these.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.033
It's the only way to travel.

16:45.437 --> 16:46.738
What are you doing!?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.073
Canterlot is that way..

16:49.575 --> 16:52.410
Yep, but you're not goin'
back to Canterlot yet.

16:55.246 --> 16:55.847
Hey!

16:56.449 --> 16:57.581
What is she...

16:57.983 --> 16:59.083
I don't know.

16:59.285 --> 16:59.851
Run!

17:10.762 --> 17:11.562
Listen, y'all.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.564
I thought I was
just bein' honest

17:13.666 --> 17:14.764
when I said all those things,

17:15.166 --> 17:18.603
but somepony helped me realize
I was actually bein' hurtful.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.440
So for that, I apologize.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.677
So, you don't think
fashion is ridiculous?

17:27.379 --> 17:30.448
Well... I... still don't
understand it,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.384
but I appreciate how much
it means to y'all

17:33.586 --> 17:35.553
and how much hard
work you put into it.

17:35.955 --> 17:38.723
I also know this contest
is important to Rarity.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.291
So what do you say?

17:43.795 --> 17:46.130
I'd hate to have come
all this way here

17:46.232 --> 17:48.166
and not see what
you can do.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.501
If they're judging, we're in.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.102
Under one condition.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.204
Literally.

17:53.706 --> 17:54.405
Anything.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.474
Untie us.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.018
Show's back on, fellas!

18:13.192 --> 18:14.325
Ah!

18:32.244 --> 18:33.043
Uh uh.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.452
Uh huh!

18:48.328 --> 18:50.728
... and then Applejack found me
and told me to distract you

18:50.830 --> 18:52.162
for an hour but the hour's up!

18:52.264 --> 18:52.897
Ta da!

18:54.299 --> 18:55.833
B-b-but... how?

18:56.035 --> 18:57.268
They were all leaving...

18:57.570 --> 18:59.170
This was all coming down.

18:59.772 --> 19:00.870
You can thank Applejack.

19:00.972 --> 19:02.870
She lit'rally did
it all by herself.

19:03.072 --> 19:05.543
I don't think that word means
what you think it means.

19:05.745 --> 19:10.015
But I did bust my tail because I
know how much this means to you.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.316
Ohh!

19:12.518 --> 19:13.851
Thank you, Applejack.

19:14.453 --> 19:15.519
We start now!

19:18.657 --> 19:20.658
First up, Lily Lace!

19:28.334 --> 19:29.300
Starstreak!

19:38.010 --> 19:39.410
Inky Rose!

19:48.420 --> 19:49.720
And now it's time to vote.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.723
I am drawn to the beauty
and drama of fashion

19:53.125 --> 19:55.993
and no pony does drama
better than Lily Lace!

19:56.095 --> 19:57.428
So I vote for her.

19:58.030 --> 20:02.300
It means soooo much to me,
I literally can't even...

20:03.402 --> 20:06.804
Simplicity is the
keynote of true elegance.

20:06.906 --> 20:10.675
That is why I vote
for Inky Rose.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.712
You've made me so.. happy?

20:16.748 --> 20:18.015
Fashion is the art!

20:18.217 --> 20:21.052
I, Photo Finish,
vote for Starstreak!

20:21.754 --> 20:23.254
Wonderful to hear, darling.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.790
Well, it all comes
down to you, Applejack.

20:26.992 --> 20:28.426
Pinkie Pie: Can you believe it!?

20:28.828 --> 20:30.294
After everything
that's happened,

20:30.396 --> 20:32.062
Applejack is the
deciding vote!

20:32.164 --> 20:34.164
Ah! This is so exciting!

20:35.366 --> 20:37.101
Well, Applejack?

20:37.403 --> 20:42.473
Uh, uh...

20:42.875 --> 20:46.377
Lily Lace's clothes go here,
Inky Rose's will go there

20:46.779 --> 20:48.212
and Starstreak's there.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.748
Sorry, but I couldn't
pick just one.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.283
They all did great
and in my opinion,

20:53.485 --> 20:54.885
they all deserve to win.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.085
And I agree.

20:56.187 --> 20:58.656
I told you your perspective
would be beneficial.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.426
Is.. this one of your
new designs, Rarity?

21:02.628 --> 21:03.561
It's, uh...

21:03.963 --> 21:06.464
the form is reminiscent of...

21:06.866 --> 21:09.700
I mean, it conjures
up images of...

21:09.902 --> 21:12.102
Well, uh..I mean...

21:12.404 --> 21:13.102
Oh, that?

21:13.504 --> 21:16.040
No, I totally
messed that one up.

21:16.242 --> 21:17.341
It's ghastly.

21:17.743 --> 21:18.375
Horrid.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.144
Absolutely terrible!

21:20.946 --> 21:22.446
Oh, thank goodness.

21:22.648 --> 21:25.550
Cause in my honest
opinion, it's awful.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.555
Rarity: When you're right,
you're right!
