WEBVTT

00:03.990 --> 00:06.100
Today we have two
special guests

00:06.110 --> 00:08.090
with a very special
announcement.

00:08.290 --> 00:11.680
Everypony, welcome the Head
of the Equestria Games,

00:11.980 --> 00:13.380
Ms. Harshwhinny.

00:17.460 --> 00:18.930
Thank you.

00:19.300 --> 00:23.410
Now I'm sure you all
know about the Equestria Games,

00:23.700 --> 00:26.910
where ponies from all over
the land compete for glory

00:26.920 --> 00:29.100
in various athletic pursuits?

00:30.380 --> 00:34.380
Well, now you littlest ones will
have the chance to compete

00:34.390 --> 00:37.330
for a weighty responsibility
of your very own.

00:37.570 --> 00:40.090
<i>Oh, c'mon! Tell them</i>
<i>the fun part!</i>

00:45.980 --> 00:47.160
That's right!

00:47.210 --> 00:49.780
All you gotta do is show
Ms. Harshwhinny the coolest,

00:49.900 --> 00:52.400
most spectacular,
most rockin' routine

00:52.520 --> 00:54.270
and you're goin' to
the Games!

00:54.620 --> 00:57.020
So, who's gonna be
the lucky ponies?

00:57.310 --> 00:58.970
It's got to be me.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.530
Maybe it's me.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.330
Maybe it's us!

01:02.640 --> 01:04.300
<i>Maybe it's us!</i>

01:08.900 --> 01:11.170
Hey! It could happen!

01:15.270 --> 01:21.240

01:51.590 --> 01:53.560
<i>So the winning team</i>
<i>gets to carry</i>

01:53.570 --> 01:56.240
<i>the Ponyville flag at</i>
<i>the Equestria Games!</i>

01:56.540 --> 01:59.080
Oh, you are gonna LOVE this!

01:59.220 --> 02:00.110
<i>Miss Dash!</i>

02:00.140 --> 02:04.330
Will you please curb
your overenthusiastic outbursts!

02:04.710 --> 02:08.020
Now then, let me be
clear on the rules.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.770
You ponies will form teams.

02:10.930 --> 02:14.160
<i>Each team will create</i>
<i>their own flag-carrying routine.</i>

02:14.310 --> 02:19.120
<i>Everypony will be judged on</i>
<i>grace, style, and originality.</i>

02:19.200 --> 02:21.480
There's a most complicated
scoring system,

02:21.490 --> 02:24.760
which I will elaborate
upon now. Firstly...

02:24.770 --> 02:26.770
Aw, Get to the
nitty gritty later.

02:27.020 --> 02:30.110
Tell them the important
stuff: like who's the coach?

02:31.720 --> 02:33.750
That's right: ME!

02:33.910 --> 02:36.450
And you know why I'm
qualified to coach you?

02:37.150 --> 02:39.640
Guess who carried the
Cloudsdale flag in the Games

02:39.650 --> 02:41.240
when she was a little filly.

02:41.610 --> 02:42.300
ME!

02:43.030 --> 02:44.220
I'll never forget it.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.320
I burst into the stadium...

02:46.500 --> 02:49.960
spreading my wings,
the flag flapping in the breeze!

02:50.280 --> 02:52.670
<i>I did tricks with that</i>
<i>flag the likes of which</i>

02:52.680 --> 02:56.760
<i>no pony saw before,</i>
<i>and no pony's seen since!</i>

02:59.560 --> 03:02.950
Professionalism, Ms. Dash,
I must insist.

03:03.130 --> 03:05.910
If you want to keep your job
as coach of these ponies,

03:05.920 --> 03:08.700
you must maintain a
professional attitude

03:08.750 --> 03:10.730
and keep your
emotions in check!

03:10.820 --> 03:15.120
Am I making myself absolutely,
100% crystal clear?

03:17.170 --> 03:18.320
Yes, Ms. Harshwhinny.

03:18.330 --> 03:21.050
You know, professionalism
is my middle name.

03:21.230 --> 03:23.460
Rainbow
"Professionalism" Dash.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.360
Hmph! Well, in
three days' time,

03:26.370 --> 03:32.000
Ms. Dash will accompany anypony
competing to the Crystal Empire

03:32.010 --> 03:34.320
where you will demonstrate
your routines for me

03:34.330 --> 03:35.920
and the other judges.

03:35.930 --> 03:39.510
Who will judge you
very professionally.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.690
Ahem! Yes, quite,
quite correct!

03:44.100 --> 03:48.100
In the meantime, get
ready to train and train hard!

03:48.350 --> 03:51.610
Because I know this Opening
Ceremony is the single most

03:51.620 --> 03:54.940
<i>important thing that will ever</i>
<i>happen in your young lives.</i>

03:55.220 --> 03:57.690
But I know you're up
for the challenge!

03:57.840 --> 03:59.090
And so am I!

03:59.250 --> 04:00.620
WA-WAHOOOO

04:02.640 --> 04:03.890
AHEM!

04:04.210 --> 04:07.160
Meet me after school tomorrow
at 1500 hours, sharp.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.780
And show me
your flag-carrying skills.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.220
I am outta here!

04:13.130 --> 04:14.000
Professionally!

04:14.380 --> 04:15.600
See how professionally?

04:17.620 --> 04:20.080
Ponies, the most
important thing is this:

04:20.310 --> 04:23.140
<i>your routine needs to show</i>
<i>what your town means to you.</i>

04:23.440 --> 04:26.010
<i>So do Ponyville proud!</i>

04:26.050 --> 04:29.660
Work hard. Be bold. Wow me.

04:30.430 --> 04:31.540
That is all.

04:36.090 --> 04:38.260
So what do you say we come
up with the perfect routine

04:38.270 --> 04:39.360
and win this thing?

04:39.520 --> 04:41.580
I'd say that's rootin'
tootin' terrific!

04:41.910 --> 04:43.150
<i>But there's one problem!</i>

04:43.450 --> 04:46.780
I bet everypony in class
is planning to compete.

04:46.790 --> 04:50.630
Listen, somepony in our class
is gonna carry that flag.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.290
So it might as well be us!

04:52.300 --> 04:54.820
Crusaders, are you in,
or are you in?

04:54.830 --> 04:56.070
Cause I'M in.

04:56.420 --> 04:57.240
Me too!

04:58.350 --> 04:59.030
Me three!

04:59.540 --> 05:01.420
All right, the winning
routine needs to show

05:01.430 --> 05:03.390
what's important about
Ponyville, right?

05:03.590 --> 05:04.180
Right!

05:04.310 --> 05:07.220
So what's special
about Ponyville?

05:07.510 --> 05:09.620
It's...It's...

05:12.750 --> 05:13.730
I've got it!

05:13.740 --> 05:15.770
It's a place where
different kinds of ponies

05:15.780 --> 05:17.350
live together as friends.

05:17.670 --> 05:19.090
Earth Ponies, like me!

05:19.430 --> 05:20.690
Unicorns, like me!

05:21.200 --> 05:22.990
And Pegasi, like me!

05:23.180 --> 05:25.830
So somehow we gotta figure out
a way to show that in our act.

05:26.370 --> 05:27.550
We're gonna
need a plan.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.220
And a lotta
hard work.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.640
And a whole bunch
of practice.

05:31.650 --> 05:34.730
But take it from me: We
may just be little ponies,

05:34.740 --> 05:37.860
but we have hearts as
strong as horses!

05:46.840 --> 05:49.700

07:40.390 --> 07:41.050
Whoa!

07:41.170 --> 07:41.620
Oof!

07:43.370 --> 07:47.800
If that's the best you've got,
we're going to win for sure!

07:48.470 --> 07:52.370
We already have the most
divine routine planned.

07:52.410 --> 07:54.870
It's absolutely
sure to crush everyone else.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.520
And I mean CRUSH!

07:57.840 --> 08:00.920
But we're winners,
and we have heaaaarts...

08:01.070 --> 08:04.060
Sure, but you know
what you don't have?

08:04.760 --> 08:06.900
<i>YOUR CUTIE MARKS!</i>

08:06.960 --> 08:10.900
Blank Flanks! Blank Flanks!
Blank Flanks!

08:11.100 --> 08:13.000
What does that have to
do with flag-carrying?

08:13.330 --> 08:16.050
Having Cutie-Mark-less
ponies represent Ponyville

08:16.060 --> 08:18.000
would be unthinkable!

08:18.130 --> 08:22.170
And we, of course,
already HAVE our Cutie Marks.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.940
So we know who's going
to be in the winner's circle.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.790
Listen you two: Cutie Marks or
no Cutie Marks, you'll see:

08:29.080 --> 08:31.900
the Crusaders are going to
carry that flag at the Games.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.470
May the best ponies win!

08:35.760 --> 08:36.540
GAME ON!

08:44.580 --> 08:48.300
Show me what you got, Cutie Mark
Crusaders. And make it good.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.940
Don't worry, we will!

08:51.100 --> 08:52.840
<i>Now, this is just a</i>
<i>little something</i>

08:52.850 --> 08:53.740
we threw together.

08:53.890 --> 08:56.550
<i>It's not perfect</i>
<i>yet. Not even close.</i>

08:56.940 --> 08:59.900
Let's watch the Cutie
Mark GOOF-saders

08:59.910 --> 09:01.790
do their sad
little routine.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.880
They're gonna be
a hot mess.

09:06.590 --> 09:09.760
<i>Since the dawn of recorded time,</i>

09:09.770 --> 09:13.360
<i>in one town of amazing</i>
<i>amazingness...</i>

09:13.370 --> 09:16.630
three types of
ponies coexist.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.730
We are Earth Ponies...

09:18.740 --> 09:20.700
We are Unicorns...

09:20.710 --> 09:23.640
We are Pegasi!

09:23.650 --> 09:27.510
<i>And the town where friendship</i>
<i>reigns is our home.</i>

09:27.520 --> 09:29.280
<i>Now welcome to the stadium</i>

09:29.290 --> 09:31.890
<i>the flag of the place</i>
<i>we love best...</i>

09:39.390 --> 09:40.790
<i>PONYVILLE FOREVER!</i>

09:40.910 --> 09:42.540
<i>YAY!</i>

09:46.390 --> 09:48.080
It's kind of a
work in progress.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.690
So, what did you think?

09:49.920 --> 09:50.410
That.

09:50.680 --> 09:51.170
Was.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.200
AMA...

09:52.510 --> 09:53.640
Wait. Hold on now.

09:53.670 --> 09:55.570
<i>Gotta stay calm,</i>
<i>cool, and collected.</i>

09:58.340 --> 10:00.540
To give a calm,
clear analysis...

10:01.350 --> 10:03.820
Wait! You whipped that
act together just yesterday?

10:04.170 --> 10:04.600
That...

10:04.760 --> 10:05.250
is...

10:05.890 --> 10:06.970
<i>Professionalism, Dash.</i>

10:06.980 --> 10:08.950
<i>Keep those emotions in check.</i>

10:09.230 --> 10:12.000
Overall it was kinda sorta...

10:14.750 --> 10:15.770
Overall it was OK.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.100
Keep working hard,
who knows?

10:17.110 --> 10:18.380
You might have a
shot. Gotta go.

10:18.890 --> 10:20.730
Do y'all think she liked it?

10:20.740 --> 10:23.060
I'm not really sure.

10:23.430 --> 10:25.420
You heard her. If we
keep working hard,

10:25.430 --> 10:26.340
we might have a shot.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.470
So let's keep working!

10:27.550 --> 10:28.790
Trot to it, ponies!

10:31.420 --> 10:32.750
Did you SEE that?

10:32.890 --> 10:36.100
I can't believe I'm saying
this. They could win!

10:36.110 --> 10:37.670
But how do we stop them?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.870
We already called
them Blank Flanks.

10:39.940 --> 10:43.020
Then we need to find a new
way to get under their skin.

10:49.010 --> 10:53.410
Or maybe, get under their WINGS.

10:54.810 --> 10:58.990
Girls, we just wanted to say
your act is quite impressive!

10:59.370 --> 11:00.470
Wait, what?

11:00.640 --> 11:02.570
Um... thanks?

11:02.790 --> 11:03.870
Oh, but of course!

11:03.880 --> 11:07.290
As a matter of fact,
we think you're very brave.

11:07.620 --> 11:09.350
Brave? Why?

11:09.420 --> 11:10.300
Isn't it obvious?

11:10.310 --> 11:11.300
It is to us.

11:11.310 --> 11:13.380
In fact, it's obvious
to everypony.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.660
You're showing all three
types of Ponyville ponies,

11:16.670 --> 11:18.640
yet you have a
Pegasus Pony...

11:18.650 --> 11:21.010
who can't even fly!

11:21.260 --> 11:23.860
What in tarnation does that
have to do with anything?

11:24.020 --> 11:25.800
I'd say
not being able to fly

11:25.810 --> 11:28.580
has everything to do with
everything, doesn't it?

11:28.940 --> 11:31.810
I mean, a Pegasus
pony at your age?

11:32.160 --> 11:34.460
You should have been
flying long ago!

11:34.700 --> 11:37.220
So what if my wings
can't get me off the ground?

11:37.600 --> 11:39.100
Your career as a
flag carrier

11:39.110 --> 11:41.330
isn't getting off
the ground, either.

11:41.730 --> 11:44.320
Ms. Harshwhinny will
never pick a Pegasus pony

11:44.330 --> 11:46.530
who can't fly to
represent Ponyville

11:46.540 --> 11:48.900
in front of all
of Equestria!

11:49.010 --> 11:51.700
Ms. Harshwinny never
said anything about that!

11:51.710 --> 11:53.790
I would've thought
that was obvious.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.990
<i>Well, have fun</i>
<i>practicing anyway.</i>

11:56.000 --> 11:59.230
Even if your routine
will never...how shall I say?

11:59.520 --> 12:00.870
"Take off."

12:02.040 --> 12:03.730
Don't listen to them, Scootaloo.

12:03.900 --> 12:04.800
Scootaloo?

12:05.150 --> 12:05.900
You OK?

12:07.760 --> 12:09.290
This routine isn't
working how it is.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.460
We've gotta rethink
my part in the whole thing.

12:11.900 --> 12:12.390
WHAT?

12:12.400 --> 12:13.090
Why?

12:13.180 --> 12:16.200
If we want to win, I'm
gonna have to fly.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.560
Is that even possible?

12:17.600 --> 12:18.780
And by tomorrow?

12:19.210 --> 12:21.370
Maybe I can fly if I
work twice as hard.

12:21.590 --> 12:22.200
See?

12:22.710 --> 12:23.430
Oof!

12:23.870 --> 12:25.990
Maybe three times as hard.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.830
<i>Golly, I don't know,</i>
<i>Scootaloo.</i>

12:27.860 --> 12:29.580
I don't think
that's the problem.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.280
Well, I know
this for sure,

12:31.380 --> 12:33.280
flying is the only
way we're gonna win.

12:33.290 --> 12:34.980
So it's back to practice!

12:35.460 --> 12:37.070
Is this a good idea?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.640
<i>Whooah!</i>

12:39.800 --> 12:42.050
I'll just work four
times as hard.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.550
Probably not.

12:46.270 --> 12:50.010
Guys, guys, guys!
Try it again.

12:51.290 --> 12:54.210
We've been rehearsing
all the livelong day!

12:54.220 --> 12:55.850
We're getting tired.

12:56.100 --> 12:59.140
Fine. We'll skip to my big
impressive flying entrance.

13:00.150 --> 13:03.130
So you've done the do-si-do
to the left, then the right,

13:03.140 --> 13:04.290
and there's the hoop.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.580
Then I come in...

13:07.000 --> 13:08.760
Not quite what I had in mind.

13:08.770 --> 13:11.660
We'll just try that
part again.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.700
I liked our routine
the way it was!

13:16.710 --> 13:20.210
Me too. But all she cares
about now is flying.

13:20.220 --> 13:22.610
Don't worry; I'll be
flyin' high tomorrow

13:22.620 --> 13:24.880
at our final run-through
for Rainbow Dash.

13:24.890 --> 13:26.880
I'm gonna get this, you'll see!

13:31.520 --> 13:34.530
Okay, Cutie Mark Crusaders,
this is your final run

13:34.550 --> 13:36.410
before you show it at the
stadium tomorrow.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.260
I know you're gonna
absolutely, positively,

13:40.030 --> 13:41.890
...have a lot of fun.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.760
OK, go!

13:48.140 --> 13:49.800
Ponyville!

13:49.810 --> 13:52.370
home of the um...

13:52.380 --> 13:53.740
Friendship!

13:53.750 --> 13:55.110
Friendship, right!

13:55.120 --> 13:57.810
There are four--no, three
kinds of ponies...

14:00.090 --> 14:01.680
Left! LEFT!

14:01.690 --> 14:02.920
I'm sorry!

14:02.930 --> 14:04.350
I'm just tired.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.090
And then I dip, and
then we turn...

14:07.350 --> 14:08.620
Sorry!

14:13.840 --> 14:14.690
<i>Tada! </i>

14:16.670 --> 14:18.860
So? What'd you think?

14:18.870 --> 14:22.170
That's. Y'know. Good and
all, heh heh.

14:22.420 --> 14:25.100
I just thought maybe
possibly you might wanna

14:25.110 --> 14:28.000
go back to, say, the first
version of the act, which was,

14:28.010 --> 14:29.810
I don't know, what's the word?

14:29.820 --> 14:30.910
Better.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.310
<i>Just do the routine</i>
<i>as it was.</i>

14:33.320 --> 14:35.680
Don't mess with
success, right?

14:35.830 --> 14:36.680
Seriously.

14:36.910 --> 14:40.320
Now I need to go coach
these other ponies.

14:40.330 --> 14:42.640
And don't forget we've gotta
catch the early train

14:42.650 --> 14:43.820
for the Crystal Empire.

14:43.830 --> 14:45.320
<i>See you in the morning!</i>

14:45.470 --> 14:46.790
What are we gonna do?

14:46.830 --> 14:51.160
We're competing tomorrow
and I still can't fly, unless...

14:51.170 --> 14:55.000
I'm just too tired.
I can't keep going.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.180
Me too!

14:56.190 --> 15:00.040
I'm tired; I'm hungry. And
now I hate this routine!

15:00.050 --> 15:02.170
It feels like it's
all about you now.

15:02.580 --> 15:03.570
<i>She's right.</i>

15:03.580 --> 15:05.410
It's like you don't
even need us anymore.

15:05.420 --> 15:07.310
Of course I need you!

15:07.320 --> 15:09.720
Without you two, who's
going to hold up the hoop?

15:09.730 --> 15:12.150
UGH! You don't
listen to yourself!

15:12.180 --> 15:13.620
Oh, forget it.

15:13.630 --> 15:16.190
<i>I'm going home to</i>
<i>get some sleep.</i>

15:16.200 --> 15:18.890
So? Are you gonna
leave me too?

15:18.900 --> 15:21.690
We've gotta catch the early
train to the Crystal Empire.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.430
I better get some rest.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.400
See you in the
morning, Scootaloo.

15:25.410 --> 15:27.170
Come on, Scootaloo!

15:27.180 --> 15:28.830
Do it for Ponyville.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.400
Just gotta try 20
times as hard.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.240
Thirty - times - as hard.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.240
Oof!

15:37.250 --> 15:39.970
Just a little harder...

15:45.110 --> 15:47.250
I can't fly.

15:47.260 --> 15:49.960
I just...
can't!

15:52.550 --> 15:56.010
Crystal Empire!
All aboard!

15:58.230 --> 15:59.260
Scootaloo?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.170
Where IS she?

16:03.430 --> 16:07.210
She better get here soon. This
here train is about to leave!

16:07.220 --> 16:09.440
<i>Here I am.</i>

16:09.450 --> 16:12.080
We were scared you were going
to miss the train.

16:12.090 --> 16:14.810
I - I'm not going.

16:14.820 --> 16:15.980
WHAT?

16:15.990 --> 16:17.420
I'm the weak link.

16:17.430 --> 16:21.420
If I go and fall, flop,
or do anything but fly,

16:21.510 --> 16:23.220
I'm gonna blow it
for you two.

16:23.380 --> 16:25.160
I can't believe you're
quitting on us!

16:25.450 --> 16:27.310
But you're better
off without me!

16:27.330 --> 16:29.290
But that's not
true, Scootaloo!

16:29.300 --> 16:32.130
Ya know what, Sweetie
Belle? Forget it!

16:32.140 --> 16:36.200
If she's gonna quit, we don't'
want her and we don't need her!

16:36.210 --> 16:37.900
FINE!

16:37.910 --> 16:38.840
Fine.

16:39.740 --> 16:40.650
Fine.

16:40.940 --> 16:43.030
<i>All aboard!</i>

16:59.620 --> 17:02.250
How's my favorite
routine going today?

17:02.260 --> 17:03.720
Oh, I just can't keep it in.

17:03.730 --> 17:05.560
I want you to win so bad!

17:05.950 --> 17:07.290
<i>"BumBUM, bumBUM". </i>

17:07.300 --> 17:09.230
Then Scootaloo does
that KAPOW!

17:09.240 --> 17:10.130
through the hoop!

17:11.440 --> 17:15.170
Well, there ain't gonna be
a Scootaloo. She's staying home.

17:15.220 --> 17:16.180
She's WHAT?

17:16.580 --> 17:19.550
She got it in her head that the
only way to represent Ponyville

17:19.560 --> 17:21.810
was by flying in our routine.

17:21.820 --> 17:25.410
When she couldn't do it,
she told us she was quitting.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.880
And then you tried to stop
her from doing that, right?

17:28.890 --> 17:32.380
Well, actually we
kinda told her...

17:32.390 --> 17:34.490
that we didn't
want a quitter.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.660
Hang on! Are you NUTS?

17:36.670 --> 17:39.890
You're a team and a team
never leaves a friend behind.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.320
Come on!

17:46.330 --> 17:48.530
Sorry you
can't make it!

17:48.540 --> 17:52.350
We'll take a picture for
you from the winners' circle.

17:53.220 --> 17:55.670
I do not like them one bit.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.240
Put on some speed, girls!

18:06.820 --> 18:09.220
<i>Throwing away</i>
<i>your scooter?</i>

18:09.230 --> 18:10.690
Rainbow Dash?

18:10.700 --> 18:12.560
Yup. But not just me.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.930
I don't want to see them.

18:17.940 --> 18:19.860
And what are they
doing here, anyway?

18:19.870 --> 18:21.970
They're supposed to
be on the train.

18:21.980 --> 18:23.500
We're not going.

18:23.510 --> 18:25.300
Not without
YOU, Scootaloo.

18:27.270 --> 18:29.340
What's gotten into
you, Scootaloo?

18:29.350 --> 18:31.330
I didn't want to ruin
their chance to win

18:31.340 --> 18:33.580
just because I couldn't fly.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.510
And who said you had to?

18:35.520 --> 18:38.920
But flying's what Pegasus
ponies are supposed to do!

18:38.930 --> 18:42.320
YOU flew when you carried
the flag in the Games.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.790
But that was me!

18:43.800 --> 18:45.460
You are you!

18:45.470 --> 18:48.360
And it just doesn't
matter if you can fly or not!

18:48.370 --> 18:50.770
<i>Your routine was amazing</i>
<i>'cause it represented</i>

18:50.780 --> 18:53.300
<i>exactly what makes</i>
<i>Ponyville special.</i>

18:53.310 --> 18:56.000
You do still know
what that is, right?

18:56.180 --> 18:57.220
Friendship.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.300
Three kinds of ponies
living together as friends,

19:00.310 --> 19:01.430
just like us!

19:01.480 --> 19:02.470
Earth Ponies...

19:02.480 --> 19:03.640
Unicorns...

19:03.650 --> 19:04.880
And Pegasi.

19:06.350 --> 19:08.380
But Rainbow Dash...

19:08.390 --> 19:12.320
What if...what if my
wings never grow?

19:12.330 --> 19:14.450
What if I never fly?

19:14.460 --> 19:17.320
Listen, Scootaloo:
maybe you'll fly someday...

19:17.330 --> 19:18.690
or maybe you won't.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.960
You're all kinds of
awesome anyway.

19:20.970 --> 19:23.930
Who's the toughest
little pony in town?

19:23.940 --> 19:29.830
<i>♪ Got the moves got the mojo</i>
<i>No harder working pony around. ♪</i>

19:30.490 --> 19:36.310
♪ We are a trio, work as a team,

19:36.320 --> 19:39.710
<i>♪ on the flag waving scene. </i>

19:39.820 --> 19:41.700
So let's get to the
Crystal Empire.

19:41.710 --> 19:43.780
And let's do the
routine as it was.

19:43.790 --> 19:46.580
And let's WIN THIS THING!

19:46.590 --> 19:50.590
<i>♪ We've got hearts</i>

19:50.600 --> 19:54.630

<i>PONYVILLE FOREVER!</i>

20:27.400 --> 20:28.730
<i>YAY!</i>

20:35.400 --> 20:37.380
<i>In the Equestria Games,</i>

20:37.390 --> 20:40.610
<i>the Ponyville Flag will</i>
<i>be carried by...</i>

20:41.600 --> 20:44.400
"Cutie Mark Crusaders"!

20:44.720 --> 20:48.220
WHOO-HOO!

20:53.950 --> 20:55.550
Ahem!

20:55.560 --> 20:58.590
Look, what you three did was...

20:58.600 --> 20:59.960
acceptable.

20:59.970 --> 21:00.990
<i>Acceptable?</i>

21:01.000 --> 21:02.490
Acceptable?

21:02.500 --> 21:06.150
Why it was totally,
stupendously the single most

21:06.160 --> 21:08.120
<i>amazing thing</i>
<i>I've ever seen!</i>

21:09.060 --> 21:11.040
Contain your
excitement, Ms. Harshwhinny.

21:11.410 --> 21:13.870
Remember, professionalism.

21:14.170 --> 21:16.410
Yes Yes, well, I...

21:24.060 --> 21:25.820
You know what this means, right?

21:26.040 --> 21:26.730
What?

21:26.740 --> 21:30.070
We are totally gonna get
Cutie Marks in Flag Carrying.

21:30.180 --> 21:31.100
Yeah!
