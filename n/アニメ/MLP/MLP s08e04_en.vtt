WEBVTT

00:15.950 --> 00:17.049
Don't worry, Angel.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.633
I won't forget you.

00:21.623 --> 00:26.158
[sigh] There's nothing so peaceful as
a Cuddly Friends picnic!

00:26.360 --> 00:27.926
[Rarity screams]
FLUTTERSHY!

00:29.630 --> 00:31.763
Oh! Goodness, Rarity,
what's the matter?

00:33.234 --> 00:37.002
[gasp] A better question would
be, what isn't the matter!?

00:37.304 --> 00:38.370
Oh, dear.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.639
Do you want to have some
lettuce and talk about it?

00:43.077 --> 00:46.946
Er. Oh, I would love to, darling,
but I just don't have time.

00:47.100 --> 00:50.334
The Canterlot Royal Fashion Show
is practically upon us

00:50.484 --> 00:54.386
and the cornerstone piece of my
collection.. just isn't working!

00:54.688 --> 00:56.521
That sounds serious...

00:56.623 --> 00:58.824
Ohhh, it's serious.

00:58.926 --> 01:02.027
The entire collection
is designed around it.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.695
Do you need help knitting?

01:03.797 --> 01:05.731
I've started
making tea cozies.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.399
It's an elephant.

01:09.303 --> 01:12.204
Yes, well, I don't need
help making clothes;

01:12.306 --> 01:14.506
Sassy Saddles is pitching
in. Plus, I'll be pulling

01:14.608 --> 01:17.008
all three of my
Manehattan assistants.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.377
All three?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.547
Does that mean you'll have
to close Rarity For You?

01:21.949 --> 01:23.649
That's just it, darling.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.518
This is Manehattan's
busiest shopping season

01:26.720 --> 01:28.320
and I can't just
close the shop,

01:28.622 --> 01:32.192
so I was hoping you might
consider running it?

01:33.294 --> 01:36.061
Of course, I'm happy
to help, though...

01:36.163 --> 01:38.330
I'm surprised you picked me.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.801
Well, I may have
asked a few others...

01:42.603 --> 01:45.237
Sorry, but we've got a
Wonderbolts show coming up.

01:46.607 --> 01:50.510
Sorry, but it's pie season and
the pie orders are pie-ling up!

01:51.312 --> 01:53.479
Sorry, I've got a
curriculum to make up.

01:54.181 --> 01:54.813
Nope.

01:55.816 --> 01:56.548
Nope.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.468
My calendar's packed, but
I hear Fluttershy's free,

02:02.690 --> 02:04.323
and you haven't
asked Boulder.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.224
Uhh...

02:05.326 --> 02:06.558
Oh?

02:07.260 --> 02:08.127
Ha ha!

02:08.229 --> 02:11.197
It doesn't matter
who else I asked

02:11.499 --> 02:15.467
because I couldn't be happier
that you agreed to help.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.780
I think I forgot how
big this shop was.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.915
How do you find anything?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.450
Oh, darling, it's
easy to track.

03:05.552 --> 03:08.087
The store is divided
into sections:

03:08.189 --> 03:11.457
Chic, Classic, Modern,
Sophisticated,

03:11.659 --> 03:14.559
Avant Garde,
Traditional, and Obtuse.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.598
And, of course, each
section is divided by

03:19.700 --> 03:23.234
season, color, and price.
It's a classic SCP system.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.605
Then it's just a little
ringing ponies up,

03:28.943 --> 03:30.242
a little fluff and fold...

03:32.946 --> 03:33.713
voilà!

03:34.015 --> 03:36.181
But of course, that's
the easy part.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.050
[gasp] It is?

03:38.152 --> 03:41.653
Mm hm! As you well know, the
real focus at Rarity For You

03:41.755 --> 03:44.154
is on the customer.
[door opens and closes]

03:44.725 --> 03:45.824
Care to give it a try?

03:46.326 --> 03:48.793
Um... OK.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.364
Hello. Um...

03:52.866 --> 03:54.600
Welcome to
Rarity for You.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.002
What can I help
you with?

03:58.372 --> 04:00.372
I need something
classic but modern.

04:00.474 --> 04:03.042
Something with drama,
but also understated.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.646
Um... aren't all those
things opposites?

04:08.048 --> 04:10.049
Yes. So?

04:10.451 --> 04:11.850
But, how can I...

04:11.953 --> 04:16.288
I'm sorry. Are you asking <i>me </i>
how to do <i>your </i> job?

04:16.390 --> 04:18.557
No! But I just, um...

04:18.659 --> 04:19.591
If I may!

04:19.693 --> 04:23.295
I'm thinking noir-esque
minimalist but with a twist...

04:23.897 --> 04:26.064
perhaps a tapered hem?

04:29.303 --> 04:31.036
[gasp] It's like you read my mind!

04:31.338 --> 04:32.771
Are you a fashion psychic?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.008
Hmmm...

04:36.100 --> 04:38.233
The inseams say.. yes!

04:46.119 --> 04:48.988
Wow. You make it
looks so easy!

04:49.290 --> 04:50.723
Oh, darling, come now.

04:51.125 --> 04:54.126
You've conquered your shyness
a thousand times over.

04:54.228 --> 04:57.929
You can't let a few fashion
ponies undo all that progress.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.431
I guess not.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.800
You simply must access
your inner strength

05:02.102 --> 05:04.269
and allow it to
shine through!

05:04.671 --> 05:05.837
How?

05:05.939 --> 05:08.540
Uh... Daily affirmations?
Meditation?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.642
Ooooh, power posing
works wonders

05:10.744 --> 05:12.243
whenever I feel
intimidated!

05:12.345 --> 05:13.145
Try these!

05:13.447 --> 05:14.846
Confident warrior!

05:15.148 --> 05:16.581
Gold medalist!

05:16.883 --> 05:18.183
Showpony!

05:21.322 --> 05:22.621
Hm. Or. Not.

05:24.591 --> 05:25.858
We need to leave now

05:25.959 --> 05:27.926
if we're going to catch
the train to Canterlot.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.595
Oh, goodness!
Look at the time!

05:30.697 --> 05:32.030
Yes, yes, yes,
yes. Go! Go!

05:32.132 --> 05:33.264
I'm right behind you!

05:36.203 --> 05:37.769
You're not going
to be here?

05:37.871 --> 05:39.138
In your workroom?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.340
Oh, darling, I simply can't.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.275
The fashion show is
in Canterlot tomorrow

05:43.377 --> 05:44.609
and I'll be up all night,

05:44.711 --> 05:47.045
even with the help
of all of my assistants.

05:48.415 --> 05:51.249
Well, not all my assistants.

05:52.219 --> 05:55.620
Smokey! Softpad! Smokey Junior!

05:58.992 --> 06:01.626
Ever since you convinced me
to let them live in the shop,

06:01.728 --> 06:04.663
these beasty sweeties have
been nothing but helpful.

06:04.865 --> 06:09.234
And I'm sure they'll help me let
my inner strength.. shine through!

06:10.700 --> 06:12.566
Oh, I wish I could stay
and offer more help.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.574
Oh! Why not try.. a new outfit?

06:18.979 --> 06:22.448
Think of it as the costume
for your role as "Shop Pony."

06:22.750 --> 06:25.284
You know what they say,
"Clothes make the pony!"

06:25.986 --> 06:27.586
Um. Who says that?

06:27.788 --> 06:28.887
You know, them.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.893
All right. I'm sure you and your
furry friends will do just fine.

06:34.995 --> 06:35.727
Ta-ta!

06:37.398 --> 06:39.297
Ah, I hope she's right.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.505
Whew... Here goes nothing.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.512
Welcome to Rarity For You.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.214
What can I help you with?

06:55.616 --> 06:57.482
What's the thread
count of this shirt?

06:57.584 --> 07:01.020
I can't be seen in anything
less than a thousand.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.389
Um... thread... count?

07:04.591 --> 07:05.124
Um...

07:05.626 --> 07:06.692
Oh, I'm not sure.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.361
Let's see... One,
two, three, four...

07:12.066 --> 07:13.965
Um, excuse me for
just one second.

07:18.039 --> 07:20.405
Oh! I'm afraid I don't know
enough about fashion

07:20.507 --> 07:22.441
to satisfy these customers.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.008
What am I going to do?

07:28.015 --> 07:32.784
Oh I've never tried to act before,
but I suppose it's worth a shot.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.758
Ahem!

07:40.160 --> 07:42.693
[firm voice] Severe,
but not unapproachable.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.700
Acceptable business
attire.

07:45.297 --> 07:45.964
[normal soft voice]
Oh...

07:46.066 --> 07:48.333
Does that sound like
a shop pony to you?

07:53.807 --> 07:58.176
So sorry for the wait, the shop
has some staffing issues today.

07:58.278 --> 08:02.314
Yes. Well, I still haven't had
an answer on this thread count.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.317
Here at Rarity for You,

08:05.419 --> 08:07.185
our merchandise defies
typical attempts

08:07.287 --> 08:08.420
to quantify its quality,

08:08.522 --> 08:11.423
but rest assured, it will make
you the envy of all who see it.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.527
Oh! In that case, I'll take three!

08:20.534 --> 08:21.700
Ta-ta.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.311
Ahh! Smokey Junior!

08:32.613 --> 08:34.379
I can't believe it worked.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.917
[snobby voice] I suppose
clothes really do

08:39.019 --> 08:40.719
make the pony after all.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.961
I don't know about you,

08:50.063 --> 08:52.331
but I have a full day
of shopping planned.

08:52.433 --> 08:55.801
And if even one shop pony
isn't up to my standards, well,

08:55.903 --> 08:58.904
I shall make my
displeasure quite plain.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.239
Oh! You are wicked!

09:03.043 --> 09:05.944
Canterlot fashion show or no, I
simply can't leave Fluttershy

09:06.046 --> 09:08.413
to fend for herself with
these Manehattanites!

09:12.119 --> 09:13.118
Rarity!

09:13.800 --> 09:15.500
Oh, darling, I'm
afraid I can't stop.

09:15.622 --> 09:17.322
Potential emergency
at the boutique!

09:17.424 --> 09:20.525
Oh. Well, whatever it is, I am
quite certain the pony

09:20.627 --> 09:22.460
you left in charge
can handle it.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.596
Oh, she's simply divine!

09:26.733 --> 09:31.469
Oh! Well, I always knew
Fluttershy had it in her, ha ha!

09:32.573 --> 09:34.940
And there's still time to
catch the train to Canterlot!

09:38.178 --> 09:40.612
It's a unique play
on the old standard.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.948
We call it a Rarity-cut with
a triple cross stitch hem

09:43.050 --> 09:45.450
in a guacamole chèvre
patterned fabric.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.886
Don't you mean chevron?

09:48.288 --> 09:51.657
If I had meant chevron, then
that's what I would have said.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.259
Heh. Of course!

09:54.461 --> 09:56.094
It's so unique!

09:56.296 --> 09:57.729
So in vogue.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.764
It must be mine!

10:05.606 --> 10:08.273
Aw, thanks, everyone, but I
feel like I should

10:08.375 --> 10:10.408
push the snootiness further.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.946
If you really wanna help, I
suppose serving tea

10:15.048 --> 10:16.715
would be nice. Oh!

10:16.817 --> 10:17.949
If you don't mind.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.860
I like my accessories
bold and shiny,

10:28.962 --> 10:32.864
and I'm just not seeing anything
nearly bold and shiny enough.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.167
I'm afraid bold and shiny
won't work with your whole...

10:36.669 --> 10:37.569
modèle.

10:38.071 --> 10:38.903
Perhaps...

10:39.706 --> 10:40.506
pointy.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.174
Pointy? Yes!

10:43.276 --> 10:44.642
I must have pointy!

10:48.381 --> 10:51.850
Not everypony can pull
off a "found object,"

10:51.952 --> 10:54.252
but you nearly get there.

10:57.608 --> 11:01.125
[valley girl accent]
I need, like, a red-carpet
glitz and glamour gown

11:01.228 --> 11:03.662
that's also casual
but, like, still

11:03.764 --> 11:06.398
artsy and a
total head turner.

11:06.800 --> 11:12.470
Yes, casual-chic prêt-à-porter
is very branché this season.

11:13.472 --> 11:14.706
Uhhh...

11:14.808 --> 11:18.143
Like I don't understand
any of that, so, like,

11:18.445 --> 11:19.711
I don't care about it?

11:20.413 --> 11:22.981
Um. One moment please.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.020
Oh... I think I need
a new character.

11:35.161 --> 11:38.763
OK, I've got, like, this high-
key, savage look for you.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.366
It's a totally live ensemble
with a little, like,

11:41.668 --> 11:44.035
thingies that sparkle and
make the whole squad go,

11:44.137 --> 11:46.371
"Whoa, that pony is woke!"

11:49.042 --> 11:52.110
That is, like,
exactly what I need!

11:57.517 --> 12:01.152
This store is a desperate
wasteland of nothingness.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.187
Do you have
anything in black?

12:05.458 --> 12:07.592
Can you, like,
chill for one sec?

12:07.794 --> 12:08.527
BRB.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.864
It's not like the futility of
shopping can be made better

12:12.966 --> 12:16.736
with black leather and metal
studs, but they help.

12:17.938 --> 12:22.206
Uh... That jacket
completes me.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.211
[Cockney accent]
This tea's like, lukewarm.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.712
It's barely drinkable.

12:27.814 --> 12:30.882
This tea must always be
at a precise temperature.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.118
See that it doesn't
happen AGAIN!

12:39.492 --> 12:41.059
Whoa, that color is like...

12:41.161 --> 12:42.995
almost too lit for you!

12:43.697 --> 12:48.200
The blackness of this vest
is a reflection of your soul.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.670
This hemline is nothing
short of an inspiration

12:51.772 --> 12:53.104
in craftsponyship!

12:53.206 --> 12:55.406
Are you sure you deserve it?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.796
I don't know what's worse, that
you've spilled the tea

13:18.098 --> 13:19.531
or that it's still cold!

13:19.633 --> 13:22.600
Either get it right or
GO BACK TO THE FOREST!

13:26.207 --> 13:29.440
Ugh! It is so hard to find
good help these days.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.211
OK, OK!

13:33.313 --> 13:34.345
Slow down, everyone.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.847
I'm doing my best.

13:44.991 --> 13:45.857
So...

13:45.959 --> 13:48.226
Rarity is busy at an
important fashion show

13:48.328 --> 13:50.562
and Fluttershy is running
her shop in Manehattan

13:50.864 --> 13:53.031
but to do it, she's playing
different shop pony

13:53.133 --> 13:54.933
characters that
are all mean?

13:56.870 --> 13:59.304
How in the world did you
figure that out, Spike?

13:59.406 --> 14:02.140
I'm not dragon charades
champion for nothing.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.509
I can't imagine Fluttershy
would ever be mean

14:04.611 --> 14:05.877
to her animal friends.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.079
This sounds serious.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.380
Spike, tell everyone it's time
to head back to Saddle Row!

14:15.055 --> 14:17.322
I wouldn't think it was
possible to make something

14:17.424 --> 14:21.960
so dowdy even more matronly,
but ... here you are!

14:22.462 --> 14:24.662
It's like a scream
in the void.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.833
Empty and ultimately
meaningless.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.771
I would seriously help you right
now, but, like, I don't wanna,

14:33.073 --> 14:33.872
you know?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.110
You weren't kidding.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.545
This is worse than we thought.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.514
She's being horrible
to everypony.

14:42.816 --> 14:45.717
Uh... are you sure
that's even Fluttershy?

14:45.919 --> 14:47.952
Maybe it's just three
really, really fast ponies

14:48.054 --> 14:49.688
that really, really
look like her.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.490
Well, let's find out.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.225
Hey, Fluttershy, are
you running the shop

14:54.327 --> 14:56.928
or performing in a
one pony show?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.030
If you don't mind, I can
only improve the taste

14:59.132 --> 15:00.865
of one customer at a time.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.166
You have to wait your turn.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.101
Ugh!

15:03.203 --> 15:06.805
Honestly, these small town
ponies come to the big city

15:06.907 --> 15:09.240
and think they can behave
any way they please.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.375
WHAT?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.711
You are a small town pony!

15:12.813 --> 15:15.279
And your cottage isn't
even in the town!

15:17.450 --> 15:20.451
Look, Fluttershy, we came here
because we were worried

15:20.553 --> 15:22.021
and we care about you.

15:22.923 --> 15:26.090
Let's get out of this
aura of positivity

15:26.192 --> 15:28.526
before it consumes us.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.399
As fun as this Fluttershy
swithcheroo game is,

15:34.601 --> 15:37.902
Smokey, Smokey Junior and
Softpad are really concerned.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.472
Yeah. They came all the way
to Ponyville to get us.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.944
They should have,
like, stayed there.

15:46.046 --> 15:49.714
This shop is, like,
a no-rodent zone now.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.851
She called them RODENTS?

15:53.253 --> 15:56.621
Fluttershy, I understand why you
think you have to act this way

15:56.723 --> 15:59.658
for these customers, but
there's gotta be a better way.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.127
Goodness, you are so right.

16:03.229 --> 16:07.932
Please, step this way so that
we may discuss your concerns.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.968
I knew you'd come
to your senses.

16:11.671 --> 16:12.904
Indeed!

16:23.483 --> 16:27.018
Oh! The centerpiece of my collection
and it's still not right.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.188
Oh, darling, I'm afraid we've
literally run out of time.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.322
It's up to you.

16:31.624 --> 16:32.957
Go out there and sell it!

16:42.035 --> 16:43.835
I don't understand.

16:43.937 --> 16:47.372
When I left Fluttershy, she
had everything well in hoof.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.808
Well, things might have seemed
all right when you left,

16:49.910 --> 16:52.110
but they're definitely
not all right now.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.547
She's acting worse than the
worst Manehattanite I ever saw!

16:55.849 --> 16:58.349
She kicked us out of the shop!

16:58.451 --> 17:02.353
She called Smokey, Smokey
Junior, and Softpad-- RODENTS!

17:02.555 --> 17:04.555
Wh-wha... RODENTS?

17:04.657 --> 17:06.357
Why didn't you say
that from the start?

17:06.459 --> 17:08.159
She obviously needs help!

17:08.361 --> 17:09.360
Come on!

17:14.300 --> 17:17.402
Your melancholy is way
too shallow for a look

17:17.504 --> 17:20.104
with this much
unfeeling depth.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.506
Ha!

17:27.247 --> 17:30.581
Ugh! Your style isn't
even on the same page.

17:30.883 --> 17:31.950
Turn away!

17:32.052 --> 17:33.651
Don't even look at it, OK?

17:34.754 --> 17:36.320
I can't. Even.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.194
I think not, dear.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.497
This is all far too fashion
forward for the likes of you.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.000
Oh! Well, I never!

17:50.736 --> 17:52.404
[door opens and slams shut]

17:53.206 --> 17:54.739
Told ya it was bad.

17:54.841 --> 17:58.343
Bad? This is worse than I
could have possibly imagined!

17:58.445 --> 18:01.412
Rarity, I'm so
glad you're here.

18:02.983 --> 18:05.483
Finally, a pony who understands
that the couture in this shop

18:05.585 --> 18:08.086
is far too brilliant to
even consider selling.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.955
WHAT?

18:10.357 --> 18:13.324
You, like, totally get
how lame customers are!

18:15.528 --> 18:19.230
Watching them leave filled
me with a sweet sadness.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.599
And you'll be pleased to
hear that I've taken care

18:21.701 --> 18:23.434
of your rodent situation.

18:25.172 --> 18:28.005
Will somepony tell her
to stop saying that!

18:28.875 --> 18:30.275
That's it!

18:30.377 --> 18:33.344
Fluttershy, I'm afraid
you've left me no choice.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.480
You are terminated!

18:35.982 --> 18:39.616
Well! Good luck
replacing me! Huh!

18:40.187 --> 18:41.652
[sigh] Well, thankfully I--

18:41.754 --> 18:42.754
AHHHAAAAHH!

18:42.856 --> 18:46.124
I always thought she
was too controlling.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.593
You-you are
terminated too!

18:49.195 --> 18:50.561
Whatever.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.163
Now I--AIIEEEEE!

18:52.265 --> 18:53.397
I know, right?

18:53.499 --> 18:55.533
I mean, O-M--

18:55.635 --> 18:58.369
Actually, you're, like,

18:58.471 --> 19:00.338
totally terminated as well.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.674
Like... OK.

19:02.876 --> 19:06.077
[gasp] Well, I'm glad
that's ov-AAAAH!

19:06.179 --> 19:09.047
I guess I owe
everypony an apology.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.115
[sigh] You think?

19:11.217 --> 19:12.117
I got so caught up

19:12.219 --> 19:14.185
trying to please all of
your customers that...

19:14.287 --> 19:16.186
What customers?

19:17.690 --> 19:21.826
I might have taken my salespony
characters a little too far.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.431
I'm sorry if I
hurt your feelings.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.867
You know I was only
pretending, right?

19:32.605 --> 19:34.739
But Fluttershy, why did you
think you needed to be

19:34.841 --> 19:36.641
somepony else to
run the shop?

19:36.743 --> 19:39.243
I guess acting like the
ponies of Saddle Row

19:39.445 --> 19:41.879
gave me the confidence to
interact with them.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.982
Darling, I'd never trust some
horrible Saddle Row pony

19:45.084 --> 19:46.484
to run my shop.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.054
That's why I wanted
a friend to do it.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.890
Well, I'd definitely
rather be myself anyway,

19:52.992 --> 19:56.327
even if I don't exactly have
what it takes to be a shop pony.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.096
I wouldn't sell
yourself short.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.598
Those salespony characters
all came from you.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.001
Yeah. I think you totally
have what it takes.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.370
Maybe a little too much.

20:06.572 --> 20:07.472
Indeed.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.774
You have all the inner
strength you need,

20:09.976 --> 20:11.776
but I think we
prefer it coming

20:11.878 --> 20:14.545
from our sweet,
regular Fluttershy.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.285
And that's just given me the
inspiration I'm looking for!

20:23.523 --> 20:25.957
And last one...there!

20:26.059 --> 20:28.226
The missing piece for
my new collection:

20:28.928 --> 20:30.828
The Warrior of
Inner Strength!

20:39.537 --> 20:40.405
Gorgeous!

20:41.107 --> 20:45.109
Oh, it's lovely, Rarity. I'm
just sorry you had to leave

20:45.211 --> 20:47.512
the Canterlot Royal
Fashion Show early.

20:47.614 --> 20:51.149
Oh, darling, making the perfect
dress is scads more satisfying

20:51.251 --> 20:52.617
than showing it off.

20:56.823 --> 21:00.091
Ooh. Striking dress, Rarity.

21:00.193 --> 21:02.026
I certainly hope you aren't
trying to undercut the

21:02.128 --> 21:05.996
Royal Fashion Show by ducking
out and debuting it here.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.632
What? No, I-I--

21:07.734 --> 21:09.634
Have you considered
the possibility

21:09.736 --> 21:12.270
that the Royal Fashion Show is
trying to undercut Rarity's

21:12.472 --> 21:14.038
by continuing on
in Canterlot

21:14.140 --> 21:16.507
and not moving the
whole affair here?

21:16.709 --> 21:18.709
Hm? HAVE YOU? HM?

21:18.911 --> 21:21.412
I, uh, no.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.815
Hmph! Just as I thought.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.420
Oh! [giggle]
Inner strength.
