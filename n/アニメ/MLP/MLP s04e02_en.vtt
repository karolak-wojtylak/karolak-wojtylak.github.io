00:03.624 --> 00:06.640
<i>It's Princess Luna and </i>
<i>Princess Celestia.</i>

00:06.806 --> 00:07.864
They're missing!

00:07.987 --> 00:10.898
The Everfree Forest is
<i>... invading.</i>

00:10.904 --> 00:13.563
<i>I think I'm starting to</i>
<i>get a pretty good idea</i>

00:13.569 --> 00:15.015
<i>of who we're up against.</i>

00:15.261 --> 00:17.390
I'm reformed; don't
you remember?

00:17.470 --> 00:20.363
Why don't you ask
your zebra friend?

00:20.424 --> 00:23.076
You can turn the potion
from purple to white.

00:23.144 --> 00:26.086
You may see why the sky is day

00:26.098 --> 00:27.218
and night.

00:27.766 --> 00:28.695
Princess Luna!

00:28.720 --> 00:31.686
There can only be one
princess in Equestria!

00:32.073 --> 00:35.852
And that princess will be me!

00:46.764 --> 00:50.688

01:42.135 --> 01:45.137
Luna! Think of how long you
were banished to the moon.

01:45.255 --> 01:47.587
You'll give us no choice but
to send you back there

01:47.587 --> 01:48.781
if you don't stop.

01:49.051 --> 01:51.428
Luna, I will not fight you.

01:51.539 --> 01:53.527
You must lower the moon.

01:53.615 --> 01:54.837
It is your duty.

01:55.380 --> 02:00.314
"Luna", I am Nightmare Moon!

02:01.610 --> 02:05.857
I have but one royal duty
now: to destroy you!

02:09.436 --> 02:11.129
And where do you
think you're going?

02:29.332 --> 02:30.698
Celestia!

02:38.860 --> 02:39.492
No.

02:40.548 --> 02:41.853
Why would Luna do this?

02:42.538 --> 02:43.092
Why now?

02:53.157 --> 02:54.146
You're all right.

02:54.971 --> 02:55.982
You're all right!

02:58.320 --> 02:59.553
Princess Celestia?

03:00.163 --> 03:01.664
Oh, dear, sister.

03:01.882 --> 03:07.026
I am sorry, but you have given
me no choice but to use these.

03:12.755 --> 03:14.887
Are those...the
Elements of Harmony?

03:15.184 --> 03:16.667
But that's how
they looked in...

03:17.114 --> 03:18.247
the past.

03:19.843 --> 03:21.775
This is the night
you banished her.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.783
Noooooo!

04:27.547 --> 04:29.438
Why are you all looking
at me like that?

04:30.446 --> 04:32.895
It's just you were
mumblin' to yourself.

04:32.907 --> 04:35.182
Oh, and don't forget the
uncontrollable sobbing.

04:35.426 --> 04:37.300
We were really
worried about you.

04:37.596 --> 04:40.357
<i>I, for one, found it </i>
<i>delightful.</i>

04:40.429 --> 04:42.640
Sort of a one-pony theater
piece, if you will.

04:42.905 --> 04:45.502
You should really consider
taking it on the road.

04:46.805 --> 04:48.497
Did you find out whose
rump we need to kick?

04:48.731 --> 04:50.044
And where we can find 'em?

04:50.497 --> 04:52.452
I saw something from
a long time ago.

04:52.766 --> 04:54.821
But it didn't explain
what's happening now.

04:55.118 --> 04:58.919
Perhaps farther back still
are the answers you seek.

04:59.149 --> 05:02.552
<i>Another sip of the potion</i>
<i>will give you a peek.</i>

05:03.383 --> 05:04.794
Are you sure about this?

05:12.005 --> 05:15.239
Oh, I do hope she breaks
into a song this time.

05:27.512 --> 05:30.839
Ho ho! Ho ho ! This
is so much fun!

05:30.963 --> 05:32.926
How about a game of
pin-the-tail-on-the-pony?

05:35.559 --> 05:38.325
Play time is over
for you, Discord.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.028
Oh, I doubt that.

05:43.047 --> 05:43.812
Hungry?

05:47.514 --> 05:48.333
Suit yourselves.

05:56.044 --> 05:58.798
Oooh. What have
you got there?

05:58.885 --> 06:01.229
The Elements of Harmony.

06:01.229 --> 06:02.801
With them we shall defeat you.

06:03.178 --> 06:05.674
This must be when they turn
Discord into stone.

06:09.038 --> 06:10.975
You should see
yourselves right now.

06:10.977 --> 06:12.934
<i>The expressions on your face.</i>

06:12.936 --> 06:16.035
<i>So intense. So sure</i>
<i>of yourselves.</i>

06:16.040 --> 06:17.756
<i>Ah ha ha!</i>

06:20.390 --> 06:21.892
Hilarious!

06:36.111 --> 06:37.402
The Tree of Harmony.

06:38.612 --> 06:40.280
The Tree of Harmony?

06:47.430 --> 06:48.680
My Cutie Mark.

06:52.915 --> 06:54.074
Are you sure?

06:54.846 --> 06:57.143
We have managed to
discover the only means

06:57.143 --> 06:59.104
by which we can
defeat Discord

06:59.104 --> 07:01.157
and free the citizens
of Equestria.

07:02.093 --> 07:03.777
<i>Even without these elements,</i>

07:03.783 --> 07:06.567
<i>the Tree of Harmony will</i>
<i>possess a powerful magic.</i>

07:11.730 --> 07:13.451
<i>As long as that</i>
<i>magic remains,</i>

07:13.566 --> 07:17.508
it will continue to control and
contain all that grows here.

07:24.548 --> 07:25.853
So, what did
you find out?

07:26.357 --> 07:28.357
I still don't know what's
happened to Princess Luna

07:28.360 --> 07:29.596
and Princess Celestia,

07:30.411 --> 07:32.107
but I think I know why
the Everfree Forest

07:32.109 --> 07:33.002
is acting this way.

07:34.089 --> 07:36.105
Something's happened
to the Tree of Harmony.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.566
The Tree of what now?

07:39.738 --> 07:41.742
It's where Princess Celestia
and Princess Luna

07:41.758 --> 07:42.599
found the Elements.

07:42.817 --> 07:44.310
I think it's in danger.

07:44.575 --> 07:47.443
Well, all right then,
let's go save a...

07:47.877 --> 07:49.002
tree.

07:49.049 --> 07:51.348
Uh, where is it exactly?

07:51.607 --> 07:53.182
I think it's in ...

07:53.496 --> 07:54.364
...there !

07:57.769 --> 07:58.638
Hoo hoo!

07:58.640 --> 08:01.104
I'm going to need
more popcorn.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.957
Seems like only yesterday we
were heading into these woods

08:13.960 --> 08:15.637
to find the Elements
of Harmony.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.033
Seems like only yesterday
I was foolish enough

08:18.040 --> 08:20.177
to think I should go
after them on my own.

08:20.895 --> 08:22.846
I don't know what we're
going to face in there.

08:23.176 --> 08:27.077
But whatever it is, I know
we need to face it together.

08:34.485 --> 08:36.150
We can use those to cross.

09:05.699 --> 09:07.416
<i>That was close.</i>

09:09.521 --> 09:11.598
A little too close
if you ask me.

09:11.601 --> 09:12.946
You sure you're
all right?

09:13.188 --> 09:14.177
I'm fine.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.563
I just can't seem to get
these new wings to do

09:16.577 --> 09:18.780
what I want them to do
when I want them to do it.

09:19.198 --> 09:20.997
Aw, you'll figure
it out eventually.

09:21.363 --> 09:23.404
"Eventually" isn't soon enough.

09:23.670 --> 09:26.764
You have been havin' an awful
lot of trouble with those things

09:26.823 --> 09:30.489
and well, who knows what
else is gonna come after us.

09:30.630 --> 09:33.016
You know, maybe it wouldn't
be such a bad idea

09:33.020 --> 09:34.583
for Twilight to go
back to Ponyville

09:34.590 --> 09:36.720
and let us look for the Tree
of Harmony without her.

09:36.973 --> 09:38.343
What? Why?

09:38.532 --> 09:41.322
For starters, you just about
got eaten by a Cragidile.

09:41.586 --> 09:42.606
We all did.

09:42.725 --> 09:44.405
He wasn't after
just me.

09:44.626 --> 09:48.614
Sure. But... well, the rest of
us aren't princesses.

09:48.846 --> 09:50.815
What's that got
to do with anything?

09:51.006 --> 09:53.619
Princess Celestia and
Princess Luna are gone.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.281
If something happened to you,

09:55.525 --> 09:58.415
I just don't think Equestria can
risk losin' another Princess.

09:58.784 --> 10:00.938
Applejack does
make a valid point.

10:01.147 --> 10:03.283
Even if we manage to
save the Tree of Harmony,

10:03.424 --> 10:05.223
it won't necessarily
mean Princess Celestia

10:05.230 --> 10:06.628
and Princess Luna
will return.

10:06.944 --> 10:09.765
Equestria will need somepony
to lead in their absence.

10:10.255 --> 10:11.434
But the Tree of Harmony.

10:11.748 --> 10:14.064
I'm the only one who has seen it
and knows what it looks like.

10:14.643 --> 10:16.622
Huge tree. Cutie
Marks on the trunk.

10:16.936 --> 10:19.192
Probably being attacked by
something hideously awful.

10:19.627 --> 10:21.906
Yeah. I'm pretty sure we'll
know it when we see it.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.153
All of you feel this way?

10:25.763 --> 10:27.664
<i>Feel like I shouldn't be here?</i>

10:29.574 --> 10:31.560
It is probably
for the best.

10:42.889 --> 10:44.624
Help! Help!

10:44.839 --> 10:45.611
Discord!

10:50.844 --> 10:52.390
You're welcome!

10:52.704 --> 10:53.313
Ha.

10:53.744 --> 10:56.263
No luck finding your tree?

10:56.396 --> 11:00.025
We ran into some trouble and my
friends decided it would be best

11:00.054 --> 11:02.497
if I returned to Ponyville
while they continue the search.

11:02.956 --> 11:04.876
Equestria will need me if
Princess Celestia

11:04.880 --> 11:06.474
and Princess Luna
don't return.

11:07.008 --> 11:09.639
I'm just surprised that
you agreed to their plan.

11:09.672 --> 11:11.488
I never thought you'd
be the kind of pony

11:11.537 --> 11:15.715
who would think she was
better than everypony else.

11:15.945 --> 11:17.646
I don't think I'm
better than anypony.

11:17.703 --> 11:21.157
Oh! Well, how silly of me to
assume you would think that.

11:21.360 --> 11:25.096
All you did was choose to keep
your precious Princess-self

11:25.110 --> 11:28.259
out of harm's way while your
friends thrust themselves

11:28.273 --> 11:29.334
right into it.

11:29.742 --> 11:33.088
<i>I'm sure you'll all be</i>
<i>the best of pals again</i>

11:33.102 --> 11:35.244
<i>when they return from</i>
<i>their terrifying,</i>

11:35.250 --> 11:37.738
<i>yet deeply bonding</i>
<i>experience</i>

11:37.882 --> 11:40.171
<i>that they're having</i>
<i>without you.</i>

11:44.919 --> 11:46.850
I never should have
agreed to come back here.

11:46.864 --> 11:49.715
Come on, Twilight,
Discord may be reformed

11:49.724 --> 11:51.147
but he's not that reformed.

11:51.281 --> 11:53.313
He's just trying to
get under your skin.

11:53.668 --> 11:55.371
Well, it's working!

12:03.752 --> 12:06.864
Anypony else starting to
think this is a lost cause?

12:07.153 --> 12:09.736
We're almost at Celestia
and Luna's old castle.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.360
Maybe whatever
Twilight saw

12:11.370 --> 12:13.982
when she took that crazy
potion wasn't real.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.600
Maybe there is no
Tree of Harmony. Maybe--

12:16.610 --> 12:18.340
Maybe it's
right down there.

12:19.426 --> 12:20.606
It can't be.

12:24.554 --> 12:26.499
How are we supposed
to get to it?

12:30.903 --> 12:32.961
Take the stairs, silly!

12:34.433 --> 12:35.750
Are we there yet?

12:36.083 --> 12:38.993
I don't know where
we are. We're lost.

12:39.804 --> 12:42.083
I never should've
left my friends.

12:42.243 --> 12:43.586
We can't just give up.

12:43.990 --> 12:46.491
Maybe if I get up there,
I'll be able to spot 'em.

12:50.714 --> 12:52.659
Well, what do you know?

12:53.886 --> 12:54.616
Twilight!

13:02.483 --> 13:04.410
Fluttershy: I think it's dying!

13:04.936 --> 13:06.643
So let's save it already.

13:09.843 --> 13:10.335
Oof!

13:10.390 --> 13:11.125
Nice try.

13:14.282 --> 13:15.412
Whoa!

13:15.420 --> 13:16.115
Oof!

13:16.491 --> 13:18.060
Valiant effort on
both your parts,

13:18.115 --> 13:20.021
but the tree
remains in jeopardy.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.337
And I suppose you've
got a better idea.

13:24.156 --> 13:25.344
That's what I thought.

13:25.845 --> 13:27.461
I know who would
know what to do.

13:28.136 --> 13:29.711
But we sent her home.

13:38.830 --> 13:41.145
It was your idea, Applejack!

13:41.545 --> 13:45.287
We all agreed it was the
best thing, Rainbow Dash!

13:45.535 --> 13:47.274
We were tryin'
to protect her.

13:53.859 --> 13:54.405
Twilight!

13:54.532 --> 13:55.168
Trouble!

13:55.348 --> 13:56.097
Help!

14:10.160 --> 14:12.585
Listen here, you
rabid rhododendrons.

14:12.776 --> 14:15.639
You mess with one of us.
You mess with all of us.

14:18.612 --> 14:20.025
Up here!

14:22.663 --> 14:25.063
Yoo-hoo! Come
and get me.

14:25.229 --> 14:26.468
Don't forget about me!

14:34.318 --> 14:35.266
<i>Ta-da! </i>

14:43.088 --> 14:45.299
I sure am glad you
came lookin' for us.

14:45.432 --> 14:47.471
Not as glad as I am
that you found me.

14:47.898 --> 14:51.869
The truth of it is, Twilight,
we're simply lost without you.

14:51.880 --> 14:55.457
Yeah. Equestria may
need its Princess...

14:55.639 --> 14:58.128
But we need our friend.

15:18.163 --> 15:19.777
<i>Even without these </i>
<i>Elements,</i>

15:19.777 --> 15:22.735
<i>the Tree of Harmony will</i>
<i>possess a powerful magic.</i>

15:22.922 --> 15:26.380
<i>As long as that magic remains,</i>
<i>it will continue to control</i>

15:26.386 --> 15:28.638
and contain all that grows here.

15:31.994 --> 15:33.916
I know how we can save the Tree.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.934
We have to give it the
Elements of Harmony.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.631
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

15:40.499 --> 15:42.556
How are we supposed
to protect Equestria?

15:42.770 --> 15:44.595
How are we meant
to rein Discord in

15:44.600 --> 15:47.346
if we can't use the Elements
to turn him back to stone?

15:47.465 --> 15:49.724
Twilight, the
Elements of Harmony...

15:49.857 --> 15:52.349
They're what keep us
connected no matter what.

15:53.601 --> 15:55.402
You're right about
one thing, Applejack.

15:55.734 --> 15:58.224
The Elements of Harmony
did bring us together.

15:58.275 --> 16:00.768
But it isn't the Elements
that will keep us connected.

16:00.897 --> 16:01.912
<i>It's our friendship.</i>

16:01.916 --> 16:04.858
<i>And it's more important and</i>
<i>more powerful than any magic.</i>

16:05.313 --> 16:06.788
My new role in Equestria

16:06.790 --> 16:08.963
may mean I have to take
on new responsibilities.

16:09.410 --> 16:11.280
And our friendships
may be tested.

16:11.473 --> 16:14.158
<i>But it will never,</i>
<i>ever be broken.</i>

16:15.112 --> 16:16.325
There's no time to lose.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.623
Everypony ready?

16:18.364 --> 16:19.055
Ready!

17:16.013 --> 17:17.685
Oh, poo!

17:41.168 --> 17:43.596
We know how difficult it
must have been for you

17:43.600 --> 17:44.905
to give up the Elements.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.590
It took great courage
to relinquish them.

18:12.891 --> 18:14.138
What's inside it?

18:14.413 --> 18:15.865
How am I supposed to open it?

18:16.085 --> 18:18.712
<i>Six locks.</i>
<i>Six keys.</i>

18:21.240 --> 18:23.235
I do not know
where they are.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.836
But I do know that
it is a mystery

18:25.840 --> 18:27.972
you will not be
solving alone.

18:35.775 --> 18:37.849
Bravo, ladies! Bravo!

18:37.850 --> 18:40.263
How ever did you save
the day this time?

18:40.265 --> 18:43.980
Blast a beastie with your
magic necklaces, I presume?

18:45.041 --> 18:47.098
Where are those little
trinkets of yours?

18:47.100 --> 18:48.938
You know, the ones you
use to send me back

18:48.944 --> 18:52.126
to my extremely
uncomfortable stone prison.

18:53.143 --> 18:53.855
Gone.

18:54.257 --> 18:55.352
Gone? Ha ha.

18:55.754 --> 18:56.669
Gone?

18:57.149 --> 18:59.377
But our friendship remains.

19:00.062 --> 19:01.998
And if you want to
remain friends,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.160
you'll stop thinking whatever
it is you're thinking

19:04.173 --> 19:06.042
and help us clean up.

19:06.474 --> 19:07.570
Fine.

19:08.074 --> 19:09.916
But I don't do windows.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.271
One thing I don't get.

19:12.357 --> 19:14.039
Why'd all this happen now?

19:14.550 --> 19:16.548
<i>I have no idea.</i>

19:16.743 --> 19:19.557
Those seeds I planted
should've sprouted up ages ago.

19:19.966 --> 19:21.465
What did you say?

19:21.568 --> 19:23.440
Oh. Why should I
try to explain it,

19:23.450 --> 19:25.851
when you can see
for yourself?

19:33.346 --> 19:36.240
Play time is over
for you, Discord.

19:37.006 --> 19:38.716
Oh, I doubt that.

19:40.723 --> 19:41.553
Hungry?

19:42.396 --> 19:45.748
Well, obviously things didn't go
<i>according to my original plan.</i>

19:45.750 --> 19:48.409
<i>My plunderseeds should</i>
<i>have stolen the magic</i>

19:48.410 --> 19:49.391
<i>from the Tree of Harmony</i>

19:49.400 --> 19:52.630
<i>and captured Princess</i>
<i>Celestia and Princes Luna</i>

19:52.640 --> 19:54.304
<i>thousands of moons ago.</i>

19:54.413 --> 19:58.257
<i>Alas, it seems the Tree</i>
<i>had enough magic</i>

19:58.260 --> 20:01.814
<i>to keep the seeds from</i>
<i>growing up big and strong.</i>

20:02.218 --> 20:03.972
<i>Until now, that is.</i>

20:05.482 --> 20:09.063
You realize this is information
we could have used hours ago?

20:09.258 --> 20:12.905
And rob you of a valuable
lesson about being Princess?

20:13.309 --> 20:15.539
What kind of friend
do you think I am?

20:36.550 --> 20:41.174
Citizens of Equestria, it is
no longer with a heavy heart,

20:41.426 --> 20:44.682
but with great joy, that
I raise the summer sun.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.543
For this celebration
now represents,

20:47.633 --> 20:50.144
not the defeat of
Nightmare Moon,

20:50.279 --> 20:54.320
but the return of my
sister, Princess Luna.
