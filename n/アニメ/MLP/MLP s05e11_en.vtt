WEBVTT

00:08.403 --> 00:11.683
You look nervous. There's
no reason to be nervous.

00:11.702 --> 00:14.758
Nothing to worry about.
Everything's gonna be fine.

00:14.940 --> 00:17.874
Twilight, tell those butterflies
in your tummy to "beat it!"

00:18.140 --> 00:20.323
Making new friends
is always fun!

00:20.697 --> 00:21.676
Oh!

00:21.954 --> 00:24.708
They're probably just
as nervous as you are.

00:24.971 --> 00:27.066
You've been planning
this shindig for weeks.

00:27.116 --> 00:30.217
You know everything about these
fellers. It's gonna be dandy.

00:32.868 --> 00:35.432
You're right. Remember,
Equestria and Yakyakistan

00:35.455 --> 00:37.657
haven't opened their borders
for hundreds of moons.

00:37.676 --> 00:40.712
In fact, Yakyakistan is so far
north of the Crystal Mountains,

00:40.910 --> 00:42.483
nopony's even BEEN there.

00:43.207 --> 00:45.260
Imagine the look on
Princess Celestia's face

00:45.295 --> 00:47.832
when she finds out we made
friends with a Yak Prince!

00:47.859 --> 00:48.327
Ha ha!

00:48.788 --> 00:50.822
I'm calm. I'm calm.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.398
PONIES! GREETINGS, PONIES!

01:09.344 --> 01:11.817
Prince Rutherford, Your Majesty,

01:12.590 --> 01:16.091
on behalf of all of us, I
welcome you to Equestria.

01:16.582 --> 01:19.481
Me honored. Yaks hope
for great friendship

01:19.680 --> 01:21.500
between Ponies and Yaks.

01:21.718 --> 01:23.889
Friends for a thousand moons!

01:25.314 --> 01:27.325
You must be hungry
after your long journey.

01:29.927 --> 01:32.906
We've prepared a banquet
of traditional yak foods.

01:34.849 --> 01:37.580
IF THINGS NOT
PERFECT, YAKS GET MAD!

01:37.900 --> 01:40.944
YAKS ALWAYS GET MAD
WHEN THINGS NOT PERFECT!

01:47.051 --> 01:52.430
THIS NO TASTE LIKE YAK FOOD!
FAKE PONY FOOD MAKE YAKS MAD!

02:05.291 --> 02:07.295
Is it OK to be nervous now?

02:14.401 --> 02:19.400
Regular subtitles by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

02:52.072 --> 02:54.868
Them yaks sure have a
funny way of saying howdy.

02:55.318 --> 02:56.617
They're different, that's all.

02:57.287 --> 02:58.560
Very different.

02:58.921 --> 03:00.304
I think they broke my record

03:00.377 --> 03:02.460
for Most Stuff Broken
in Under a Minute.

03:02.678 --> 03:04.777
I mean, they even
broke the trophy.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.184
All we have to do is show them

03:07.207 --> 03:09.036
how great it can be
to have friends before

03:09.055 --> 03:11.649
Princess Celestia arrives for
the friendship party tonight.

03:11.843 --> 03:14.914
Now, who read the seven-volume
cross-indexed history

03:14.933 --> 03:16.655
of Yakyakistan I recommended?

03:17.451 --> 03:19.824
I - I had a thing.

03:20.179 --> 03:22.556
I did! I did! Did you know
they live so far North

03:22.579 --> 03:24.754
of the Crystal Empire that
it's cold all the time?

03:24.948 --> 03:27.135
Yaks have yak fur
to keep them warm!

03:27.916 --> 03:30.754
Pretty sure that's what fur's
always for, Pinkie Pie.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.474
I KNOW! YAKS ARE SO COOL!

03:35.478 --> 03:37.432
Pinkie Pie, can you
show them around town?

03:37.554 --> 03:39.649
I know you have to plan
the friendship party too,

03:39.889 --> 03:41.729
but it would really help
make them feel welcome.

03:42.072 --> 03:44.243
Don't worry. They'll be
in good hooves with me.

03:44.784 --> 03:47.649
Remember, we want to make sure
Equestria feels like home.

03:47.984 --> 03:49.565
That means doing
everything we can

03:49.592 --> 03:51.805
to make this place
feel like Yakyakistan.

03:52.034 --> 03:53.158
No problem!

03:53.466 --> 03:56.590
Good. Let's get out there
and make some new friends.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.876
We know y'all are noble warriors

04:02.895 --> 04:05.161
who avoid the
so-called finer things,

04:05.428 --> 04:07.516
so me and my family'd be honored

04:07.535 --> 04:10.228
if you rested here in the
barn during your visit.

04:10.727 --> 04:12.540
Applejack and I made hay beds

04:12.563 --> 04:14.681
like you're used to
back in Yakyakistan.

04:15.512 --> 04:18.160
HM. THIS PERFECT.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.304
You can snooze
here all afternoon

04:20.339 --> 04:23.390
cause you're gonna need a lot
of energy for my party tonight.

04:24.434 --> 04:25.619
That wasn't so hard.

04:25.824 --> 04:26.674
WAIT!

04:27.817 --> 04:29.630
THIS NOT YAK HAY!

04:29.881 --> 04:33.211
Well, we didn't have actual
hay from Yakyakistan,

04:33.344 --> 04:35.828
but we tried our best to
make it just like yours--

04:36.102 --> 04:38.952
NOT PERFECT! YAKS DESTROY!

04:43.542 --> 04:45.443
Pinkie Pie, what do we do?

04:49.257 --> 04:51.870
And now, for your
entertainment pleasure,

04:52.003 --> 04:55.588
presenting, "Animals,
Yakyakistan Style."

05:01.500 --> 05:02.613
ANIMALS CUTE!

05:02.929 --> 05:04.746
OH. Thank goodness.

05:07.767 --> 05:12.838
WAIT. THESE ANTLERS A LIE!
THESE NOT YAKYAKISTAN ANIMALS!

05:12.982 --> 05:14.735
YAKS SMASH!

05:22.346 --> 05:26.190
OK, well, there's still other
things we can do...I think.

05:27.954 --> 05:31.291
Yes, these are some of my
favorite materials, very rare,

05:31.318 --> 05:32.864
imported from the Crystal Empire

05:32.880 --> 05:34.483
to match your Northern
sensibilities.

05:34.857 --> 05:36.125
I hope you'll find them...

05:39.192 --> 05:39.980
delicious.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.411
This no taste like yak fabric!

05:44.579 --> 05:46.114
YAKS DESTROY!

05:51.074 --> 05:53.066
Everything's gonna be fine;

05:53.592 --> 05:57.337
you just make it
up to them somehow.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.504
Listen up! Tell your faces
to hold onto their frowns,

06:01.691 --> 06:04.426
cause they're about to
get turned upside down.

06:04.910 --> 06:06.674
HOLD YOUR FROWN, FACE!

06:07.527 --> 06:09.207
Hit it, Rainbow Dash!

06:12.849 --> 06:15.131
Just like Yakyakistan
snow, right?

06:15.329 --> 06:18.220
Because snow is snow, no
matter where it comes from.

06:23.241 --> 06:24.742
THIS NOT YAK SNOW!

06:27.763 --> 06:28.948
Seriously?

06:29.497 --> 06:30.586
Seriously?

06:36.015 --> 06:38.586
You know? It's going OK.

06:39.161 --> 06:40.792
Satisfactory, I'd say.

06:41.257 --> 06:42.880
It could be better.

06:43.379 --> 06:45.226
It's not very good.

06:45.699 --> 06:47.375
It's a disaster!

06:47.622 --> 06:50.232
Pinkie Pie. Tonight's
Yakyakistan-theme party

06:50.255 --> 06:51.615
is more important than ever.

06:51.923 --> 06:54.883
You'll make them forget all
about this afternoon, right?

06:56.491 --> 06:57.828
Because if it's not perfect,

06:58.049 --> 06:59.680
they're going to
smash everything,

06:59.893 --> 07:02.895
and I'm not sure how much more
smashing this visit can take!

07:03.520 --> 07:07.348
I definitely will,
I think... maybe?

07:07.653 --> 07:10.278
You're the best gosh-darn
party planner in Equestria.

07:10.742 --> 07:12.262
You'll show 'em a good time.

07:12.491 --> 07:13.923
You can do it.

07:14.152 --> 07:17.249
We have absolute confidence in
your abilities, Pinkie Pie.

07:17.927 --> 07:21.013
It's going to be my most
happy-tacular party ever...

07:21.120 --> 07:21.897
I hope!

07:24.045 --> 07:26.304
Why are your eyes
darting around like that?

07:27.043 --> 07:29.840
It's what I do when I'm not
nervous! Hahahahahahaha!

07:30.480 --> 07:33.470
Pinkie Pie, I don't know
what we'd do without you.

07:33.497 --> 07:34.739
Me either! GOTTA GO!

07:44.777 --> 07:46.510
Gummy! What am I gonna do?

07:46.590 --> 07:48.666
I have all this amazing
stuff planned for the party

07:48.681 --> 07:49.706
but they're going to hate it!

07:50.369 --> 07:53.196
There's no way to make Equestria
feel like Yakyakistan.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.137
They're just too sensitive.

07:56.491 --> 08:01.996
Even Fluttershy made
them mad. FLUTTERSHY!

08:02.434 --> 08:05.306
Oh, I need a new idea,
and I need it now.

08:05.626 --> 08:08.449
How am I supposed to make this
party feel like Yakyakistan

08:08.468 --> 08:11.200
without actually going there
and bringing something back?

08:15.337 --> 08:17.043
Gummy, you're a genius!

08:19.596 --> 08:21.961
And this is Sugarcube Corner.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.207
They're working hard to make you
a traditional Yakyakistan cake.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.163
VANILLA EXTRACT
BALANCE VERY TRICKY!

08:30.228 --> 08:32.838
Do you mind, um, waiting
here for one moment?

08:34.354 --> 08:35.481
How's tonight's party coming?

08:35.588 --> 08:38.240
I'm doing what I can, but it's
really up to you at this point.

08:40.167 --> 08:43.756
Pinkie? Where are you?

08:52.320 --> 08:53.127
Did you find her?

08:53.398 --> 08:55.371
Angel and I searched
the forest, but...

08:56.940 --> 08:58.963
Aerial recon turned
up nothing, either.

08:59.299 --> 09:02.445
I searched the farm inside
and out. No Pinkie Pie.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.100
But I did find a set of
Granny Smith's dentures

09:05.127 --> 09:08.662
under the house. So...not
a complete loss.

09:08.918 --> 09:10.540
She's simply vanished!

09:10.693 --> 09:14.057
But the party, it's all we have
left. What are we going to do?

09:19.500 --> 09:22.179
"Don't worry. I'll be back
in time for the party.

09:22.430 --> 09:23.893
Love, Pinkie Pie."

09:24.899 --> 09:27.577
If Pinkie Pie says she'll be
back in time for the party,

09:27.638 --> 09:28.365
she'll be back.

09:28.594 --> 09:32.198
We have to trust her. Right?
No reason to FREAK OUT.

09:33.043 --> 09:34.483
Don't worry, Twilight.

09:34.598 --> 09:35.763
When it comes to parties,

09:35.927 --> 09:37.714
I think she knows
what she's doing.

09:39.611 --> 09:42.647
You're right, let's just focus
on keeping the yaks happy

09:42.662 --> 09:43.466
till she's back.

09:44.064 --> 09:45.146
Piece of cake.

09:45.958 --> 09:47.241
The cake!

09:47.580 --> 09:49.493
One bite and you'll
be transported

09:49.516 --> 09:53.123
right back to
Yakyakistan. Ha ha!

09:53.451 --> 09:54.068
I hope.

09:59.287 --> 10:03.299
PONIES TOO HEAVY ON
VANILLA EXTRACT! BWAR!

10:03.710 --> 10:06.769
We've never needed
a party so badly.

10:13.306 --> 10:15.584
Next stop, Crystal Empire!

10:17.386 --> 10:20.377
And so my quest begins.

10:20.518 --> 10:21.984
I know what you're thinking:

10:22.198 --> 10:24.933
"Why go to Yakyakistan
alone, Pinkie Pie?"

10:25.264 --> 10:27.428
Because I'm the party planner.

10:27.805 --> 10:32.099
This burden falls on my
rump, and my rump alone.

10:32.358 --> 10:33.855
If I want a great party,

10:34.034 --> 10:36.784
I gotta climb the mountains
North of the Crystal Empire,

10:37.020 --> 10:41.203
find Yakyakistan, and come
back with something authentic.

10:41.756 --> 10:42.780
Know what I mean?

10:48.598 --> 10:49.794
Did we go the wrong way?

10:50.967 --> 10:51.939
Where's all the snow?

10:52.255 --> 10:54.975
Please tell me this is
magical sand-colored snow!

10:56.518 --> 11:00.144
Pthew! Nope! Sand.
Definitely sand.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.020
Dodge City. End of
the line, I'm afraid.

11:03.081 --> 11:06.430
All trains had to stop. Sheep
decided to sit on the tracks.

11:07.794 --> 11:09.782
CURSE YOU, SHEEP!

11:10.171 --> 11:11.653
Thanks for your help, Conductor.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.161
Cherry Jubilee!

11:17.885 --> 11:20.609
Pinkie Pie? I reckoned
I eyeballed you

11:20.628 --> 11:22.060
crossin' my way right now.

11:22.163 --> 11:25.344
How ARE you? You look
amazing! I need help!

11:25.592 --> 11:28.666
I'm dandy as a daffodil
and fit as a floribunda.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.125
What can I do ya for?

11:30.552 --> 11:31.992
Have you heard of Yakyakistan?

11:32.083 --> 11:33.958
Do you have ANY idea
how I could get there?

11:34.022 --> 11:35.542
Mark your calender, missy,

11:35.641 --> 11:37.680
cause this right
here's your lucky day.

11:37.885 --> 11:41.203
I'm headin' north to the Crystal
Empire myself for a delivery.

11:41.710 --> 11:45.916
I oughta warn you, though. Me
and the boys are powerful tired

11:45.935 --> 11:48.312
cause we was up all
night countin' cherries.

11:48.628 --> 11:50.156
Hey there! Wake up!

11:50.670 --> 11:52.784
Counting cherries? How many?

11:52.979 --> 11:54.640
Four hundred and
seventeen thousand,

11:54.662 --> 11:57.630
two hundred and
thirty-four. YEE-HAW!

11:57.664 --> 11:58.434
Whoa!

12:01.268 --> 12:03.714
And so my quest resumes.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.780
As I stare across
the endless desert,

12:06.990 --> 12:10.365
I tell myself I will soon
triumphantly enter the homeland

12:10.384 --> 12:13.032
of our noble guests
and return with a prize

12:13.059 --> 12:15.550
to make the best party
they've ever seen.

12:15.729 --> 12:16.849
You know what I mean?

12:18.567 --> 12:19.390
Cherry?

12:25.626 --> 12:28.045
RAVINE! RAVINE!

12:31.508 --> 12:32.297
WAKE UP!

12:33.234 --> 12:34.160
WAKE UP!

12:43.013 --> 12:44.396
STOP!

12:51.032 --> 12:53.813
Whoa! I was dreamin'
about a ravine.

12:56.521 --> 12:58.392
RAVINE!

12:59.074 --> 12:59.881
That's what I said!

13:17.348 --> 13:22.777
MUSIC BEAUTIFUL! MUCH SOUL!

13:24.095 --> 13:25.036
Phew.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.984
When Twilight told me to
stall, I mean,entertain you,

13:30.003 --> 13:32.316
I thought "there's
NO way I could--"

13:34.140 --> 13:34.758
Huh?

13:38.746 --> 13:39.546
Spike!

13:40.834 --> 13:42.560
PIANO PLAY ITSELF?

13:42.742 --> 13:46.201
MUSIC A LIE! BWAR!

13:50.163 --> 13:55.554
WE DEMAND PARTY! PARTY
NOW, OR YAKS NO FRIENDS!

13:56.057 --> 13:58.175
No! Just a little longer!

13:58.274 --> 14:00.872
NO MORE LONGER! WE LEAVE NOW!

14:00.979 --> 14:04.339
YAKS GO GET TRAIN!
RETURN WITH MORE YAKS!

14:04.552 --> 14:07.779
WE DECLARE WAR!

14:17.428 --> 14:19.927
No Pinkie Pie? What's this?

14:20.487 --> 14:23.916
Heh heh. We panicked and
tried to plan our own party.

14:25.196 --> 14:27.512
It's sorta panic-themed.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.104
The yaks are going
home! This is awful!

14:31.645 --> 14:33.961
I wanted to surprise
Princess Celestia.

14:34.506 --> 14:37.935
Now the only surprise is that I
may have just started a war.

14:40.019 --> 14:44.022
There we were, face to face
with Falling Pony Ravine.

14:44.304 --> 14:48.407
Down! Down! Down! And
then suddenly-- POW!

14:48.579 --> 14:50.468
We were rescued MID-AIR
by the Wonderbolts!

14:50.521 --> 14:52.179
And then they gave me
a ride to Manehattan

14:52.194 --> 14:53.413
where I joined a travelling band

14:53.436 --> 14:55.459
and we played some shows
here and there, got popular,

14:55.478 --> 14:57.036
almost made it big until
creative differences

14:57.051 --> 14:57.988
tore us apart.

14:58.369 --> 15:01.120
And that's when I knew I had
to get back on with my journey

15:01.146 --> 15:04.579
to the Crystal Empire, the
gateway to Yakyakistan!

15:04.887 --> 15:08.464
And so, here I am! It
was a major adventure

15:08.537 --> 15:10.678
that took most of the afternoon.

15:11.318 --> 15:12.091
You know what I mean?

15:12.422 --> 15:16.022
This is it: the northern
boundary of the Crystal Empire.

15:16.430 --> 15:18.400
Beyond lies Yakyakistan.

15:18.746 --> 15:21.820
Nopony who's attempted this
climb has ever returned.

15:22.179 --> 15:23.965
Are you sure you
have to do this?

15:24.449 --> 15:25.093
I do.

15:25.641 --> 15:27.009
Good luck, Pinkie Pie.

15:31.744 --> 15:35.192
How could she be so late to the
party? This isn't like her.

15:35.622 --> 15:37.855
I'm sure she's trying her best.

15:38.289 --> 15:40.247
Pinkie Pie's tougher
than she looks.

15:40.499 --> 15:43.699
I know you're right,
but...I wish she was here.

15:43.931 --> 15:47.813
I put too much pressure on
her. I let everypony down.

15:48.011 --> 15:50.175
And Princess Celestia
will be here any minute

15:50.198 --> 15:54.354
and see that I haven't made new
friends. I've made new enemies.

16:08.750 --> 16:12.247
Hi! My name is Pinkie Pie!
I'm looking for Yakyakistan.

16:12.419 --> 16:15.683
You know: faraway land, lots of
yaks. Maybe you've heard of it?

16:19.634 --> 16:23.470
Whoa, slow down, I can't
understand a word you're saying.

16:30.339 --> 16:33.020
There it is! Yakyakistan!

16:49.333 --> 16:58.533
Noooooooo!

16:59.356 --> 17:00.834
Is everypony all right?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.470
I can't tell if my eyes
are opened or closed.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.462
I think I can
see a little bit.

17:07.375 --> 17:07.889
Nope.

17:13.878 --> 17:16.316
Ooooooooh!

17:18.419 --> 17:22.575
Look at these. Pinkie Pie's made
files for everypony in town.

17:22.849 --> 17:25.676
With exactly what kind
of parties we like.

17:25.870 --> 17:31.085
Pinkie Pie has a Secret Party
Planning Cave! How cool is this?

17:31.325 --> 17:33.702
Twilight Sparkle likes
vanilla ice cream,

17:33.939 --> 17:35.664
red balloons, dancing.

17:35.824 --> 17:36.925
That's right.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.462
But she's afraid
of quesadillas.

17:40.179 --> 17:41.409
No I'm not!

17:41.630 --> 17:42.685
They're just so

17:44.217 --> 17:45.051
cheesy.

17:53.390 --> 17:56.613
No! I'm all the way
back where I started!

17:56.933 --> 17:59.318
Gummy, I was this close
to helping Twilight

17:59.348 --> 18:00.255
befriend the yaks!

18:00.438 --> 18:03.017
Now I've just let
everypony down.

18:09.371 --> 18:12.266
Lookie here.
It's notes for the party

18:12.281 --> 18:14.750
she wants to throw for her
folk's 50th anniversary.

18:14.906 --> 18:16.438
But they ain't nearly that old.

18:16.739 --> 18:19.520
Huh. She's already
plannin' their 100th, too.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.386
And their 500th?

18:21.775 --> 18:24.723
I had no idea she worked
so hard on her parties.

18:24.899 --> 18:27.779
She may be more organized
than you, Twilight.

18:27.977 --> 18:29.455
Let's not get carried away.

18:29.851 --> 18:31.485
I just wish Pinkie Pie were here

18:31.504 --> 18:34.434
so we could tell her how much we
all appreciate her hard work.

18:34.620 --> 18:40.834
Thank you, thank you! I
love you too, all of you!

18:41.024 --> 18:42.220
You're back!

18:42.777 --> 18:45.089
I tried to go to Yakyakistan so
I could bring something back

18:45.142 --> 18:47.653
for my party but at the last
second I made a mistake.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.916
I worked harder on this
party than any party ever,

18:52.308 --> 18:54.971
but I'm still just
a big failure.

18:55.161 --> 18:57.660
Pinkie Pie, you're
not a failure.

18:57.931 --> 19:00.297
What matters is
how hard you tried.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.864
Who else would've gone
all across Equestria

19:02.883 --> 19:04.502
to plan one party?

19:05.508 --> 19:08.255
You know, the trip
was really hard,

19:08.468 --> 19:11.367
but everypony I met along
the way was so helpful.

19:11.546 --> 19:14.518
I just wish the yaks could see
how friendly and wonderful

19:14.540 --> 19:16.548
and great Equestria really is.

19:19.683 --> 19:23.474
I JUST GOT THE BEST
PARTY IDEA EVER!

19:23.542 --> 19:26.880
It's too late. The yaks
left on the last train.

19:27.169 --> 19:29.066
Um, no they didn't.

19:29.657 --> 19:33.424
Trust me, there are a whole
lot of sheep out there.

19:36.369 --> 19:41.112
So, do we walk back
up the slide, or what?

19:42.620 --> 19:46.994
YAKS STUCK HERE? WHY
TRAINS NOT WORK? GRRRR!

19:47.036 --> 19:51.596
I never thought I'd say
this, but THANK YOU, SHEEP!

19:52.083 --> 19:56.620
And now, if it's OK with
you, it's party time.

20:06.076 --> 20:10.361
Wow, Pinkie, this came
together quick, even for you.

20:10.483 --> 20:13.074
What can I say? I'm
good at what I do.

20:13.641 --> 20:15.596
Prince Rutherford,
every time we tried

20:15.611 --> 20:18.403
to make something in Equestria
feel like Yakyakistan,.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.782
we couldn't get it right.

20:19.946 --> 20:22.982
When I got back from my
adventure, I realized something.

20:23.257 --> 20:25.920
We shouldn't try to make
Equestria feel like your home.

20:26.179 --> 20:29.398
We should try to make you
feel at home in Equestria.

20:29.699 --> 20:32.822
And that means showing
you why we love it here,

20:32.906 --> 20:34.693
so you'll love it too.

20:38.967 --> 20:44.826
Pink pony work hard to make yaks
feel at home. Now yaks happy.

20:45.104 --> 20:46.986
No declare war.

20:51.379 --> 20:54.300
Ponies and yaks. Friends?

20:54.548 --> 20:56.060
For a thousand moons?

20:56.350 --> 20:58.308
For a thousand MOONS!

21:02.563 --> 21:04.662
I am very impressed, Princess.

21:04.982 --> 21:08.407
Ha hah. Just doing my
best to spread friendship.

21:08.681 --> 21:14.171
And you did a wonderful job
of it. You and your friends.

21:14.761 --> 21:17.904
Pink Pony? You
understand yaks now.

21:18.190 --> 21:20.586
Aw, come here, you.

21:26.339 --> 21:29.542
Wow, too strong. OK! OK! OK!
