00:03.781 --> 00:06.340
Princess Celestia cordially
invites you to the wedding of

00:06.481 --> 00:09.206
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza,
and...

00:09.357 --> 00:10.557
my brother?!

00:10.808 --> 00:12.051
Twilie!

00:12.352 --> 00:13.781
Ah, I've missed you, kid.

00:13.932 --> 00:16.831
How dare you not tell me in person
that you were getting married!

00:16.982 --> 00:19.056
A threat has been made
against Canterlot.

00:19.207 --> 00:22.981
Princess Celestia asked that I help
provide additional protection.

00:23.581 --> 00:26.251
But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying
somepony I don't even know.

00:26.402 --> 00:29.592
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance.

00:29.743 --> 00:32.206
Cadance is only the most amazing
pony ever!

00:32.457 --> 00:35.111
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

00:35.262 --> 00:37.480
Cadance, it's me! Twilight!

00:42.858 --> 00:44.667
And I think I should wear it.

00:44.818 --> 00:46.626
Are you disagreeing with me?

00:50.081 --> 00:51.432
She's evil!

00:51.631 --> 00:54.987
I saw her put a spell on my brother
that made his eyes go all...

00:55.138 --> 00:57.661
Cadance hasn't been
casting spells on me,

00:57.812 --> 01:00.423
she's been using her magic to heal me.

01:00.574 --> 01:03.781
If I were you, I wouldn't show up
to the wedding at all.

01:03.931 --> 01:07.279
I just lost a brother.
I'm sorry.

01:07.580 --> 01:08.781
You will be.

01:13.014 --> 01:18.014

01:52.015 --> 01:53.514
Hello?

01:57.212 --> 01:58.933
Is anyone there?

02:05.055 --> 02:06.103
Where am I?

02:06.914 --> 02:08.728
The caves beneath Canterlot.

02:08.879 --> 02:12.083
Once home to greedy unicorns
who wanted to claim the gems

02:12.225 --> 02:13.565
that could be found inside.

02:13.816 --> 02:16.699
And now, your prison.

02:16.850 --> 02:18.391
Help! Help!

02:19.463 --> 02:22.052
It's no use. No one can hear you.

02:22.203 --> 02:25.006
And no one will ever think
to look for you, either.

02:25.510 --> 02:28.332
Most ponies have forgotten
that these caves even exist.

02:28.483 --> 02:32.658
Which is why they are the ideal place
to keep the ones who try to interfere

02:32.809 --> 02:34.079
with my plans.

02:35.688 --> 02:38.175
Plans? What plans?

02:39.451 --> 02:41.360
The plans I have for your brother,
of course.

02:42.615 --> 02:45.665
Don't you dare do anything
to my brother, you...

02:45.815 --> 02:46.856
you monster!

02:47.407 --> 02:50.166
Only way to stop me is to catch me!

02:52.972 --> 02:54.217
Over here!

02:59.215 --> 03:01.767
Nope,
over here!

03:12.245 --> 03:13.907
No! Wait!

03:15.286 --> 03:17.544
Please! Don't hurt me!

03:18.150 --> 03:20.014
Twilight, it's me!

03:20.866 --> 03:22.737
Please, you have to believe me.

03:22.888 --> 03:24.469
I've been imprisoned like you.

03:24.620 --> 03:27.115
The Cadance who brought you
down here was an imposter.

03:27.366 --> 03:29.165
Likely story!

03:29.316 --> 03:32.695
Sunshine, sunshine,
ladybugs awake.

03:32.846 --> 03:33.996
Clap your hooves...

03:34.147 --> 03:35.668
...and do a little shake.

03:39.020 --> 03:40.555
You remember me!

03:40.706 --> 03:42.498
Of course I do.

03:42.649 --> 03:46.051
How could I forget the filly
I love to sit for the most?

03:53.015 --> 03:54.623
We have to get out of here.

03:55.848 --> 03:57.413
We have to stop her!

04:12.728 --> 04:16.416
<i>This day is going to be perfect</i>

04:16.567 --> 04:20.729
<i>The kind of day of which
I dreamed since I was small</i>

04:21.030 --> 04:25.306
<i>Everypony will gather round,
say I look lovely in my gown</i>

04:25.457 --> 04:29.984
<i>What they don't know is
that I have fooled them all!</i>

04:30.251 --> 04:33.949
<i>This day was going to be perfect</i>

04:34.100 --> 04:37.815
<i>The kind of day of which
I dreamed since I was small</i>

04:38.516 --> 04:42.615
<i>But instead of having cake,
with all my friends to celebrate</i>

04:42.766 --> 04:46.715
<i>My wedding bells they may
not ring for me at all</i>

04:46.815 --> 04:48.920
<i>I could care less about the dress</i>

04:49.071 --> 04:51.677
<i>I won't partake in any cake</i>

04:51.828 --> 04:55.143
<i>Vows, well I'll be lying when I say</i>

04:55.294 --> 04:59.403
<i>That through any kind of weather,
I'll want us to be together</i>

04:59.554 --> 05:03.486
<i>The truth is I don't care for him at all!</i>

05:03.637 --> 05:06.715
<i>No, I do not love the groom</i>

05:06.866 --> 05:10.551
<i>In my heart, there is no room</i>

05:10.702 --> 05:17.277
<i>But I still want him to be all mine!</i>

05:17.428 --> 05:21.528
<i>We must escape before it's too late,
find a way to save the day</i>

05:21.679 --> 05:24.716
<i>Hope, I'll be lying if I say</i>

05:24.867 --> 05:28.741
<i>I don't fear that I may lose him,
to one who wants to use him</i>

05:28.892 --> 05:32.330
<i>Not care for, love and cherish
him each day</i>

05:32.481 --> 05:35.687
<i>For I oh so love the groom</i>

05:35.838 --> 05:39.737
<i>All my thoughts he does consume</i>

05:39.888 --> 05:47.224
<i>Oh Shining Armor,
I'll be there very soon</i>

05:55.992 --> 05:59.801
<i>Finally the moment has arrived</i>

05:59.952 --> 06:03.372
<i>For me to be one lucky bride</i>

06:03.523 --> 06:07.080
<i>Oh, the wedding we won't make,
he'll end up marrying a fake</i>

06:07.231 --> 06:09.907
<i>Shining Armor will be...</i>

06:10.058 --> 06:12.378
Mine, all mine.

06:17.186 --> 06:19.231
Mares and gentlecolts,

06:19.382 --> 06:22.464
we are gathered here today
to witness the union of

06:22.615 --> 06:26.338
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza
and Shining Armor.

06:27.809 --> 06:29.614
We're never going to save him.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.981
We will.
We just have to find...

06:33.238 --> 06:34.527
there!

06:37.897 --> 06:41.429
You're not going anywhere.

06:50.025 --> 06:52.793
Princess Cadance and Shining Armor,

06:52.944 --> 06:55.285
it is my great pleasure
to pronounce you...

06:55.486 --> 06:56.605
Stop!

07:01.985 --> 07:04.705
Why does she have to be
so possessive of her brother?

07:06.685 --> 07:09.836
Why does she have
to ruin my special day?

07:10.767 --> 07:13.840
Because it's not your special day.

07:13.991 --> 07:15.091
It's mine.

07:16.467 --> 07:17.347
What?

07:17.498 --> 07:19.563
But how did you escape my bridesmaids?

07:29.724 --> 07:31.192
I want it!

07:34.475 --> 07:36.678
Clever. But you're still too late.

07:36.829 --> 07:39.665
I don't understand.
How can there be two of 'em?

07:39.816 --> 07:41.558
She's a changeling.

07:41.709 --> 07:44.575
She takes the form of somepony
you love and gains power

07:44.726 --> 07:46.226
by feeding off your love for them.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.981
Right you are, Princess.

08:07.132 --> 08:10.633
And as queen of the changelings,
it is up to me to find food

08:10.784 --> 08:12.084
for my subjects.

08:12.235 --> 08:15.890
Equestria has more love than
any place I've ever encountered.

08:16.041 --> 08:19.724
My fellow changelings will be
able to devour so much of it

08:19.875 --> 08:23.454
that we will gain more power
than we have ever dreamed of!

08:23.605 --> 08:25.169
They'll never get the chance!

08:25.320 --> 08:28.800
Shining Armor's protection spell
will keep them from ever even reaching us.

08:30.693 --> 08:32.325
Oh, I doubt that.

08:32.476 --> 08:34.076
Isn't that right, dear?

08:39.020 --> 08:41.557
Don't wanna go back to the caves,
now do you?

08:43.415 --> 08:47.990
Ever since I took your place, I've been
feeding off Shining Armor's love for you.

08:48.141 --> 08:51.125
Every moment he grows weaker,
and so does his spell.

08:51.276 --> 08:54.239
Even now my minions
are chipping away at it.

08:59.912 --> 09:04.685
He may not be my husband,
but he is under my total control now.

09:06.025 --> 09:12.181
And I'm sorry to say, unable to perform
his duties as captain of the royal guard.

09:12.332 --> 09:13.775
Not my Shining Armor!

09:14.226 --> 09:17.160
Soon, my changeling army
will break through.

09:17.311 --> 09:21.175
First, we take Canterlot.
And then, all of Equestria!

09:21.625 --> 09:22.855
No.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.141
You won't.

09:26.310 --> 09:30.371
You may have made it impossible
for Shining Armor to perform his spell,

09:30.522 --> 09:33.771
but now that you have so foolishly
revealed your true self,

09:34.422 --> 09:38.167
I can protect my subjects... from you!

09:58.600 --> 10:00.373
Princess Celestia!

10:03.644 --> 10:07.369
Shining Armor's love for you
is even stronger than I thought!

10:07.520 --> 10:11.475
Consuming him has made me
even more powerful than Celestia!

10:11.626 --> 10:14.755
The Elements of Harmony,
you must get to them...

10:14.906 --> 10:17.353
and use their power
to defeat the queen.

10:23.783 --> 10:25.069
Rarity!

10:30.805 --> 10:33.877
You can run, but you can't hide!

10:53.565 --> 10:54.907
Go, go!

11:14.998 --> 11:17.645
Looks like we're gonna have
to do this the hard way.

11:25.618 --> 11:26.403
How did you...?

11:35.475 --> 11:36.905
They're changelings, remember?

11:37.056 --> 11:38.789
<i>They're changelings, remember?</i>

11:39.097 --> 11:40.588
Don't let them distract you.

11:40.739 --> 11:42.583
We have to get to
the Elements of Harmony.

11:42.734 --> 11:43.934
They're our only hope.

12:14.695 --> 12:17.008
OK, this is just gettin' weird.

12:29.195 --> 12:30.805
Real me! Real me!

12:36.662 --> 12:37.790
Do me! Do me!

12:42.399 --> 12:43.548
I've seen better.

13:36.150 --> 13:37.633
You won't get away with this!

13:37.784 --> 13:39.564
Twilight and her friends will...

13:42.658 --> 13:44.199
You were saying?

13:44.800 --> 13:48.589
You do realize the reception's
been cancelled, don't you?

13:48.800 --> 13:51.627
Go! Feed!

13:55.450 --> 13:56.822
It's funny, really.

13:56.973 --> 14:00.020
Twilight here was suspicious of
my behavior all along.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.700
Too bad the rest of you were too
caught up in your wedding planning

14:03.851 --> 14:06.367
to realize those suspicions were correct.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.527
Sorry, Twi.
We should've listened to you.

14:09.678 --> 14:12.670
It's not your fault.
She fooled everypony.

14:13.184 --> 14:15.248
I did, didn't I?

14:20.181 --> 14:23.600
<i>This day has been just perfect</i>

14:23.751 --> 14:28.411
<i>The kind of day of which
I've dreamed since I was small</i>

14:28.562 --> 14:30.424
<i>Everypony I'll soon control</i>

14:30.575 --> 14:32.744
<i>Every stallion, mare and foal</i>

14:32.899 --> 14:37.465
<i>Who says a girl can't really have it all?</i>

14:42.547 --> 14:45.200
Quick! Go to him while
you still have the chance!

15:10.135 --> 15:11.777
Is...is the wedding over?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.399
It's all over!

15:16.550 --> 15:18.700
Your spell! Perform your spell!

15:21.199 --> 15:25.299
What good would that do?
My changelings already roam free.

15:27.322 --> 15:28.405
No!

15:34.460 --> 15:36.454
My power is useless now.

15:36.605 --> 15:38.577
I don't have the strength to repel them.

15:38.828 --> 15:41.271
My love will give you strength.

15:42.199 --> 15:45.961
What a lovely but absolutely
ridiculous sentiment.

16:48.456 --> 16:51.499
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

16:51.650 --> 16:54.000
You have a real wedding
to put together.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.628
Seriously, though.

17:53.779 --> 17:56.600
I get why the queen of the Changelings
wanted to be with you, but how did you

17:56.750 --> 17:59.588
get someone as amazing as
Cadance to marry you?

17:59.739 --> 18:02.085
I told her she wouldn't just
be gaining a husband,

18:02.236 --> 18:04.800
she would be getting a
pretty great sister too.

18:28.122 --> 18:30.170
Mares and gentlecolts,

18:30.321 --> 18:33.767
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the union of the real

18:33.918 --> 18:35.758
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza...

18:35.909 --> 18:37.322
Princess Cadance is fine.

18:38.233 --> 18:41.946
The union of Princess Cadance
and Shining Armor.

18:42.097 --> 18:44.173
The strength of their commitment
is clear.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.975
The power of their love, undeniable.

18:47.322 --> 18:49.013
May we have the rings, please?

18:52.817 --> 18:56.496
I now pronounce you mare and colt.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.360
This is your victory as much as theirs.

19:11.511 --> 19:13.751
You persisted in the face of doubt.

19:13.902 --> 19:18.623
And your actions led to your being able to
bring the real Princess Cadance back to us.

19:19.074 --> 19:23.086
Learning to trust your instincts
is a valuable lesson to learn.

19:28.861 --> 19:30.961
Rainbow Dash, that's your cue.

19:38.444 --> 19:41.186
Best. Wedding. Ever!

19:50.906 --> 19:53.917
Hello, everypony.
Did I miss anything?

19:59.400 --> 20:02.855
Let's get this party started!

20:04.700 --> 20:07.179
<i>Love is in bloom</i>

20:07.399 --> 20:11.657
<i>A beautiful bride, a handsome groom</i>

20:11.800 --> 20:14.929
<i>Two hearts becoming one</i>

20:15.435 --> 20:19.965
<i>A bond that cannot be undone because</i>

20:20.116 --> 20:23.500
<i>Love is in bloom</i>

20:23.651 --> 20:27.170
<i>A beautiful bride, a handsome groom</i>

20:27.321 --> 20:31.103
<i>I said, love is in bloom</i>

20:31.254 --> 20:34.691
<i>Starting a life and making room</i>

20:34.842 --> 20:36.342
<i>For us
(For us)</i>

20:40.060 --> 20:41.037
Twilight!

20:41.188 --> 20:44.299
None of this would've been
possible without you, little sis.

20:44.599 --> 20:46.295
Love you, Twilie.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.788
Love you too, B.B.B.F.F.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.428
Ready to go?

20:55.579 --> 20:57.200
Oh! Almost forgot.

21:00.150 --> 21:01.689
IT'S MINE!

21:10.927 --> 21:13.683
Now this was a great wedding.

21:13.834 --> 21:14.934
Oh yeah?

21:15.085 --> 21:18.621
Just wait until you see what I have
planned for the bachelor party!
