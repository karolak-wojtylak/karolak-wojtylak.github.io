00:19.569 --> 00:20.960
Hey, Applejack.
Whatchya doin'?

00:22.880 --> 00:25.938
Well, I was practicin'
my distance buckin'.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.864
Distance bucking? What for?

00:30.190 --> 00:33.476
Because Cousin Braeburn and
the rest of the Apple Family

00:33.520 --> 00:35.206
in Appleoosa seem to think

00:35.236 --> 00:38.190
that their team can beat
Ponyville at Buckball.

00:42.104 --> 00:46.830
WHAT? Ha! That's ridiculous!
Nopony beats Ponyville!

00:47.101 --> 00:50.110
I mean, I could beat the whole
town of Appleoosa at Buckball

00:50.147 --> 00:52.418
with one wing tied
behind my back.

00:59.815 --> 01:02.461
So I can count on you to join
the Ponyville Buckball team?

01:02.763 --> 01:07.066
Oh, yeah! I am so there.
I've just got one question.

01:07.489 --> 01:08.178
Mm?

01:08.430 --> 01:10.935
Uh, what's Buckball?

01:19.847 --> 01:24.840

https://yp1.yayponies.no/

01:52.676 --> 01:56.578
So basically, Buckball
is the coolest game ever.

01:57.033 --> 02:00.775
Offense! Defense!
Teamwork. Non-stop action.

02:00.923 --> 02:02.381
It's got it all!

02:02.843 --> 02:05.772
Wow, Rainbow Dash. You
sure seem to know a lot

02:05.803 --> 02:10.006
about this game. I've never
even heard of Buckball.

02:10.486 --> 02:12.436
Yeah. I'm kind of an expert.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.101
Hah, an expert who hadn't
heard of the game either

02:15.150 --> 02:16.160
until I told you.

02:16.301 --> 02:17.778
Well, it's a
new game.

02:18.067 --> 02:19.993
I probably know more
than most ponies

02:20.036 --> 02:21.796
so that makes me
an expert.

02:22.104 --> 02:24.283
I don't know anything
about it at all.

02:24.363 --> 02:26.110
But it sounds like there's
a ball and bucking,

02:26.172 --> 02:28.609
so I'm betting it's
super-duper fun.

02:28.953 --> 02:31.021
The point is my
cousin Braeburn

02:31.083 --> 02:32.732
somehow convinced
a Pegasus

02:32.800 --> 02:34.270
and a unicorn to
come play

02:34.313 --> 02:35.932
with him on the
Appleoosa team.

02:36.141 --> 02:38.535
And he can't stop bragging
about how his team

02:38.578 --> 02:40.227
is gonna beat ours.

02:40.596 --> 02:43.150
But, um, we don't
have a team.

02:43.415 --> 02:45.144
Well, between Applejack and me,

02:45.212 --> 02:46.584
we've got two
thirds of a team.

02:46.652 --> 02:48.209
All we need is
a unicorn.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.067
That's where you
two come in.

02:50.400 --> 02:55.458
Uh, they know we're
not unicorns, right?

02:55.723 --> 03:00.135
Uh, obviously. You're
gonna be on my team

03:00.221 --> 03:02.756
and Fluttershy is gonna
be on Applejack's team.

03:03.009 --> 03:06.000
We'll play against each other,
along with whatever unicorns

03:06.055 --> 03:08.344
wanna try out until
we find the best one.

03:08.646 --> 03:12.338
Oooohhhhhh! Phew,
that's a relief

03:12.430 --> 03:15.120
because I left my
unicorn costume at home.

03:19.372 --> 03:21.901
I know a lot of you are
here because I told you

03:21.938 --> 03:24.332
what an amazing
game Buckball is.

03:24.467 --> 03:27.495
And even though it's already
an Apple Family favorite,

03:27.686 --> 03:30.160
most of you probably don't
know anything about it.

03:30.289 --> 03:32.516
So I thought we'd give
you a quick demonstration.

03:34.824 --> 03:36.916
The two earth ponies
are on offense.

03:37.224 --> 03:39.833
They meet in the middle of
the field for the buck off.

03:40.092 --> 03:42.418
They both try to be the
first one to kick it.

03:46.763 --> 03:48.984
And the Pegasus is on defense.

03:49.243 --> 03:51.520
She tries to keep the ball
from going in the goal

03:51.563 --> 03:54.578
and passes it back to the
earth pony on her team.

03:54.689 --> 03:56.461
Just give it a
little kick, Pinkie.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.132
Oooh! I get it!

04:03.544 --> 04:06.689
And all the unicorns have to
do is float these here baskets

04:06.732 --> 04:08.123
around the outside
of the field

04:08.289 --> 04:11.009
and catch as many balls as
possible for their team.

04:11.575 --> 04:12.652
You two get
the idea?

04:12.910 --> 04:14.424
Absolutely!

04:14.787 --> 04:18.129
Oh, I don't know. That
ball moves pretty fast.

04:18.941 --> 04:23.052
All right. Now let's see which
of you has what it takes.

04:29.218 --> 04:31.827
Um...what do I do?

04:32.424 --> 04:35.747
When the ball comes
towards you... catch it.

04:40.683 --> 04:42.455
OK, just try your best, Pinkie.

04:42.830 --> 04:44.947
I have been doing this
a lot longer than you.

04:45.089 --> 04:46.369
HA-uhh.

04:46.935 --> 04:47.987
Nice kick.

04:49.673 --> 04:54.092
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whee! Haha!

04:54.258 --> 04:55.495
Great save, Fluttershy!

04:58.781 --> 05:00.196
Coming your way, Pinkie!

05:00.387 --> 05:02.190
Somersault, kick!

05:07.969 --> 05:10.363
Hey, this game is easy!

05:10.504 --> 05:13.390
Oh, it actually is
kind of fun.

05:13.944 --> 05:16.793
Where did Pinkie Pie
learn to buck like that?

05:17.378 --> 05:21.132
And Fluttershy's spinning
tail catch is pretty amazing!

05:21.520 --> 05:25.790
Um... OK, well let's see
what the rest of you can do.

05:28.769 --> 05:31.538
Now, don't expect to be able
to beat me twice in a row.

05:33.415 --> 05:36.252
Well, hello there
Mr. Ball. Whee!

05:38.196 --> 05:38.972
Hiyah!

05:41.501 --> 05:42.695
Hurry along, butterflies,

05:42.787 --> 05:44.492
before that ball
comes and hits you.

05:47.181 --> 05:52.418
Nope. Um. OK, let's see
what the rest of you can do.

05:54.473 --> 05:55.126
Nope.

05:56.806 --> 05:57.772
Definitely, not.

06:00.178 --> 06:01.120
Noooo.

06:02.664 --> 06:03.803
Not a chance.

06:04.818 --> 06:05.630
No.

06:05.981 --> 06:06.756
Nope.

06:07.716 --> 06:14.172
And...no. Uh, this didn't
go how I thought it would.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.821
It sure didn't.

06:20.006 --> 06:21.673
This game is a
whole lot more fun

06:21.729 --> 06:23.046
than I thought
it would be.

06:23.187 --> 06:25.446
It's exactly as much fun
as I thought it would be...

06:25.563 --> 06:27.144
A WHOLE BUNCH!

06:27.612 --> 06:31.550
Carrying my water,
my water, my water.

06:31.698 --> 06:35.316
Carrying my water
on my shoulder pole.

06:35.433 --> 06:38.344
SNAILS, LOOK OUT!

06:43.033 --> 06:44.486
Amazing!

06:44.886 --> 06:46.966
You should be more
careful with these.

06:47.083 --> 06:48.350
You could lose them.

06:50.904 --> 06:55.120
Hey, Snails? Can you float one
of those baskets over here?

06:56.276 --> 06:56.953
Sure.

06:57.107 --> 06:58.578
What do you want
me to do with it?

06:59.058 --> 06:59.815
CATCH!

07:04.381 --> 07:05.673
Anything else?

07:07.600 --> 07:10.726
Wow, Snails, you're a
natural at Buckball.

07:11.101 --> 07:14.178
It's a good thing, too. We
were running out of unicorns.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.098
Do you think you'll be
ready to play with Applejack

07:16.141 --> 07:18.338
and Rainbow Dash against
the Appleoosa team?

07:18.633 --> 07:21.932
I guess I'll find out. Plus,
after I deliver this water,

07:21.987 --> 07:23.784
I don't really have
anything else to do.

07:24.289 --> 07:26.652
Well, Snails, with
you on the team,

07:26.935 --> 07:31.046
Ponyville is one step closer
to crushing Appleoosa.

07:31.741 --> 07:33.969
And after today,
it's pretty clear

07:34.000 --> 07:35.692
who the other two
players should be.

07:36.966 --> 07:38.116
What do you mean?

07:38.252 --> 07:40.233
I thought you and Dash
were going to play.

07:40.578 --> 07:44.209
Yeah. If you're not
crushing Appleoosa, who is?

07:46.412 --> 07:49.446
Uh you two, obviously.

07:57.544 --> 08:00.455
Um, you want us to
play Buckball

08:00.516 --> 08:02.855
against Appleoosa
instead of you?

08:03.113 --> 08:03.938
Mm hm.

08:04.621 --> 08:06.640
That's un-credible.

08:08.744 --> 08:12.240
Unbelievable and
incredible? Come on.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.421
I can't explain it, but
you two are really good

08:15.446 --> 08:18.252
at this game and if it
means beating Appleoosa,

08:18.443 --> 08:20.375
I'll give either one of
you my spot on the team

08:20.455 --> 08:22.504
quicker than Granny
Smith can core an apple.

08:22.830 --> 08:26.627
Me too. I'd normally be so
pumped all of Ponyville

08:26.664 --> 08:27.661
was counting on me to win,

08:27.760 --> 08:29.464
I'd run right over
the competition,

08:29.766 --> 08:32.012
but you still flew
rings around me.

08:32.504 --> 08:35.612
Oh, I'm sorry. I
was just having fun.

08:35.870 --> 08:38.307
Well, you can have all the
fun you want as long as it's

08:38.369 --> 08:41.095
while you're beatin' the
hide off of Braeburn's team.

08:41.606 --> 08:43.575
I do like fun.

08:43.858 --> 08:46.492
Honestly, the game was
a little scary at first,

08:46.572 --> 08:49.846
but once I got the hang of
it, I had a pretty good time.

08:50.067 --> 08:53.107
Let's get this
party started!

08:53.390 --> 08:56.541
All right, but if we really
wanna beat Appleoosa,

08:56.793 --> 08:58.633
we're gonna have
to get serious.

08:59.347 --> 09:00.646
Serious?

09:01.064 --> 09:03.593
Serious how?

09:05.193 --> 09:07.267
With serious practice!

09:09.384 --> 09:12.424
Wow. This looks
pretty intense.

09:12.960 --> 09:16.036
Well, duh. You two are
gonna be representing

09:16.098 --> 09:19.870
all of Ponyville, and
more importantly...Us!

09:20.160 --> 09:22.836
That's why before we leave
for Appleoosa tomorrow,

09:22.947 --> 09:25.889
you two are gonna practice
just as hard as we would.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.901
So, let's hop to it.

09:28.141 --> 09:30.473
Snails already has
a head start on you!

09:37.335 --> 09:39.132
OK. If you wanna win,

09:39.298 --> 09:41.236
you've totally gotta
get this drill down.

09:41.464 --> 09:42.800
I-I-I do?

10:02.055 --> 10:03.827
It's all about ball control.

10:06.455 --> 10:08.492
Ready? GO!

10:10.812 --> 10:13.809
Come on! Faster! You don't
want Ponyville to lose

10:13.846 --> 10:15.889
because you can't get
into high gear, do you?

10:16.301 --> 10:17.033
Whoaaa.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.486
All right, being able to
buck a ball into a goal

10:26.541 --> 10:29.606
from any direction is the most
important thing in the game.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.233
If you say so.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.513
WHEEE! WOOO!

10:51.864 --> 10:55.606
Keep it up! Just one miss'll
ruin the Apple Family's

10:55.643 --> 10:57.538
Buckball reputation forever.

10:58.043 --> 10:59.120
WHOA--What?

11:06.313 --> 11:07.206
Whoops.

11:08.929 --> 11:11.304
Come on! Push. Push! PUSH!

11:13.070 --> 11:16.061
Come on now! Every shot
is for Sweet Apple Acres.

11:16.129 --> 11:18.713
And me! And Dash!
And all of Ponyville!

11:18.740 --> 11:21.169
Whoa. Ow.

11:21.876 --> 11:22.701
Faster!

11:22.849 --> 11:23.581
Whoa.

11:24.486 --> 11:25.212
C'mon, now!

11:25.883 --> 11:27.360
Whooaaa!

11:28.086 --> 11:28.978
C'mon!

11:31.046 --> 11:31.852
Keep it up!

11:32.067 --> 11:33.544
Whooaaa!

11:33.667 --> 11:34.455
C'MON!

11:43.273 --> 11:45.489
What in the apple
happened to those two?

11:45.975 --> 11:49.175
I don't know! They mopped
the field with us before.

11:51.489 --> 11:53.741
All right! That's
it for today, y'all!

11:55.569 --> 11:58.732
I thought practice was
supposed to make us better.

11:59.144 --> 12:01.593
Maybe we just need
a little rest.

12:01.969 --> 12:03.901
Or a whole lot of it.

12:04.486 --> 12:07.378
Just be sure to get your heads
in the game before tomorrow.

12:07.692 --> 12:09.815
All of Ponyville is
counting on a win.

12:17.889 --> 12:19.101
I really don't want to let

12:19.187 --> 12:22.406
Applejack and Rainbow Dash
down, or anypony else,

12:22.449 --> 12:26.763
but after that practice, I'm
not feeling very confident.

12:27.255 --> 12:29.107
Maybe we weren't that bad.

12:30.584 --> 12:34.196
I guess I was hoping you
saw something I didn't.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.160
I know our friends
want us to win,

12:36.215 --> 12:38.541
but how can the whole
town be counting on us

12:38.566 --> 12:40.818
if most ponies have never
even heard of Buckball?

12:41.347 --> 12:43.889
I know! How can we
disappoint a pony

12:43.938 --> 12:45.772
who doesn't even
know we have a team?

12:46.092 --> 12:48.190
Or that we're going
to play Appleoosa.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.015
Yeah, I don't think
we need to worry.

12:51.255 --> 12:53.156
I'd be surprised
if anypony in this town

12:53.273 --> 12:55.126
cares about this game at all.

12:57.772 --> 13:02.836
Go Ponyville! Go
Ponyville! WIN! WIN! WIN!

13:04.090 --> 13:06.233
Ponyville, Ponyville!
Way to go! You can do it!

13:06.424 --> 13:09.421
Whoa. The whole
town really seems

13:09.464 --> 13:11.501
to care about
this game a lot.

13:18.097 --> 13:23.168
Woo-hoo, go Ponyville!

13:31.612 --> 13:34.633
We kinda went around town and
talked up the team a little.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.033
Yep. We wanted to
make sure you two knew

13:37.070 --> 13:39.261
that all of Ponyville
was behind you.

13:39.778 --> 13:42.270
Greaaaaat.

13:42.670 --> 13:44.972
I hear the whole town's
already planning a parade

13:45.009 --> 13:47.070
for when you get back
after whoopin' Appleoosa.

13:47.292 --> 13:48.726
That should feel pretty good.

13:49.409 --> 13:50.603
It should?

13:50.843 --> 13:54.006
Totally! Just spend the
whole ride to Appleoosa

13:54.073 --> 13:55.846
thinking about
everypony cheering

13:55.913 --> 13:58.412
for the victorious
Ponyville Buckball Team.

13:59.107 --> 14:02.043
I bet Princess Celestia even
comes to congratulate you.

14:02.264 --> 14:05.932
If that doesn't get you in the
zone, I don't know what will.

14:08.627 --> 14:11.778
I don't know what zone Rainbow
Dash is talking about,

14:12.012 --> 14:15.206
but I'm pretty sure I don't
want to be in it. Do you?

14:19.070 --> 14:22.473
Hey, you two are supposed
to be in the zone.

14:23.440 --> 14:27.624
You see... The thing is...
Thinking about everpony...

14:28.196 --> 14:31.390
thinking about us...
there's just no way...

14:31.864 --> 14:34.012
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
WE CAN GET IN THE ZONE

14:34.086 --> 14:36.227
BECAUSE THE ZONE SOUNDS
LIKE A HORRIBLE PLACE

14:36.301 --> 14:38.030
SINCE WE ARE
TERRIBLE AT BUCKBALL

14:38.080 --> 14:40.929
AND WE ARE GOING TO LOSE
AND LET EVERYPONY DOWN

14:41.027 --> 14:43.655
AND WE DON'T WANT
TO PLAY ANYMORE!

14:49.003 --> 14:51.181
I'm still OK with playing,
in case you were worried.

14:54.116 --> 14:56.886
I don't get it.
They're naturals.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.861
Why wouldn't they
want to play anymore?

14:59.101 --> 15:02.443
Maybe us telling them how much
everypony was counting on them

15:02.492 --> 15:03.840
messed them up somehow.

15:04.018 --> 15:05.975
What? That's crazy talk.

15:06.486 --> 15:09.280
Having ponies depend on you
is exactly what you need

15:09.316 --> 15:10.369
to focus and...

15:10.480 --> 15:12.080
Get serious and play hard and...

15:12.135 --> 15:15.070
Get ready to totally smash
the competition and...

15:16.190 --> 15:20.756
And none of that sounds like
Pinkie or Fluttershy, does it?

15:21.286 --> 15:23.704
Guess not.

15:23.981 --> 15:26.873
We got so wrapped up in
what's important to us,

15:26.978 --> 15:29.661
we went and ruined what was
fun about the game for them.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.255
What do we do now?

15:39.427 --> 15:41.766
Pinkie? Fluttershy?

15:41.963 --> 15:43.163
We know you're in here.

15:43.335 --> 15:45.766
We've looked in every
other car on the train.

15:46.147 --> 15:48.110
Maybe you need
to look again.

15:48.412 --> 15:51.796
Yeah. Because we're totally
not in here.

15:52.036 --> 15:54.178
And we're definitely
not in here

15:54.313 --> 15:56.898
if you're going to try and make
us play against Appleoosa.

15:57.636 --> 15:58.886
Or anypony else!

16:00.560 --> 16:03.058
Oh, we're sorry
to let you down,

16:03.347 --> 16:04.572
but it's better
to do it now

16:04.609 --> 16:06.603
than during the game
against Appleoosa.

16:06.972 --> 16:09.778
You don't have to play
against Appleoosa.

16:11.200 --> 16:11.987
We don't?

16:12.646 --> 16:14.775
Nope. We're gonna
take your place,

16:15.033 --> 16:17.249
so you don't have to
worry about that at all.

16:18.523 --> 16:20.190
Why didn't you say so?

16:20.449 --> 16:23.889
But.... We can't take on
Braeburn and his team

16:23.950 --> 16:25.766
without any practice

16:25.864 --> 16:28.553
so we need you to play
just one more time...

16:28.763 --> 16:30.018
Against us.

16:34.190 --> 16:36.313
Now I know we mixed
up the teams before,

16:36.369 --> 16:39.181
but since Dash and I
really need the practice,

16:39.341 --> 16:40.867
we'll play against
the two of you.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.089
Oh, I don't know how much
practice you'll get

16:49.120 --> 16:52.449
against us. We've been
playing just awful.

16:52.726 --> 16:54.160
Don't worry about it.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.947
Applejack and I just
need a little workout.

16:57.415 --> 16:59.587
Yep. You two just
do your best.

17:00.110 --> 17:01.316
I can do that.

17:05.993 --> 17:06.867
Oooooh!

17:21.280 --> 17:23.310
Ooooh!

17:26.067 --> 17:28.867
Looks like you two
really do need practice.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.160
Wheee!

18:13.655 --> 18:16.504
If you need more practice,
we can keep going.

18:16.707 --> 18:19.686
Yeah. I could do
this all day.

18:19.803 --> 18:22.172
Uh, no thanks.

18:22.295 --> 18:25.396
Playing against you two
is just as humiliating now

18:25.446 --> 18:27.532
as it was when we weren't
trying to show you

18:27.550 --> 18:28.867
how awesome you are.

18:29.778 --> 18:31.778
Wait. What?

18:33.864 --> 18:35.218
Finally!

18:36.867 --> 18:39.507
You must have noticed how
you aren't bad anymore.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.621
Oooh yeah. Weird.

18:43.058 --> 18:46.443
But um, why were we
so terrible before?

18:46.793 --> 18:49.193
I guess some ponies
thrive on pressure

18:49.304 --> 18:50.818
and some ponies don't.

18:51.132 --> 18:53.741
And even though we weren't
playing, we were treating

18:53.766 --> 18:56.338
you like us which totally
stressed you out.

18:56.818 --> 18:59.661
And that just sucked the fun
right out of the game for you.

18:59.963 --> 19:01.772
And having fun is
what makes you

19:01.840 --> 19:03.575
really, really,
really good.

19:04.030 --> 19:06.892
But being good doesn't
matter if we're too afraid

19:06.916 --> 19:08.707
of letting ponies down.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.556
Yeah. What about all those
ponies back in Ponyville

19:11.661 --> 19:13.396
counting on us to win.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.464
I'm sure folks want
you to win,

19:15.495 --> 19:18.160
but not if worrying about
it makes you miserable.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.252
Winning's never worth that.

19:20.516 --> 19:23.587
But how do we keep
from worrying about it?

19:23.846 --> 19:26.400
You could do what I do
and not think about it.

19:27.304 --> 19:30.818
Seriously, I don't think
about anything. Ever.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.046
Hmm, works for me!

19:39.507 --> 19:41.963
And with another bouncing
goal from Pinkie Pie,

19:42.012 --> 19:43.636
the score is tied!

19:45.501 --> 19:47.212
You guys are amazing!

19:48.172 --> 19:49.913
Braeburn is really good!

19:50.252 --> 19:53.858
So is that Pegasus. Oh I
don't know if we can win.

19:54.036 --> 19:55.563
You know what I would do...

19:56.043 --> 19:58.436
Not think about it?

19:58.732 --> 20:00.018
...not think--

20:01.876 --> 20:04.369
Oh. Yeah. That.

20:05.550 --> 20:07.372
And as long as
you're having fun,

20:07.427 --> 20:09.778
it doesn't matter
if you win or not.

20:14.135 --> 20:17.107
Hee-hee! I think it's
more fun this way.

20:18.929 --> 20:23.027
And Pinkie wins the buckoff.
But her shot's rejected!

20:23.390 --> 20:26.633
Back to Braeburn, whose
kick's stopped by another

20:26.670 --> 20:30.000
Fluttershy save.
Next point wins.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.307
Lots of tense back
and forth here.

20:32.781 --> 20:35.267
Fluttershy unleashes
her patented spin move.

20:35.575 --> 20:36.867
But Braeburn's there to-

20:37.126 --> 20:40.166
NO! It's Pinkie with
a somersault kick.

20:40.221 --> 20:44.935
What a move! And that's
the game! Ponyville wins!

20:45.003 --> 20:50.393
PONY-VILLE! PONY-VILLE!
PONY-VILLE! PONY-VILLE!

20:50.516 --> 20:55.224
PONY-VILLE! PONY-VILLE!

20:56.221 --> 20:58.695
Looks like you three
made quite an impression.

20:59.415 --> 21:01.864
Well, cousin, I
have to admit,

21:02.129 --> 21:04.738
your Ponyville team
played a pretty good game.

21:05.458 --> 21:09.778
Ha! Good game? We bucked the
hooves right off of you.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.252
Yep. You sure as shootin' did.

21:12.572 --> 21:15.212
I'm gonna have to get real
serious about a strategy

21:15.286 --> 21:16.566
for our rematch.

21:17.138 --> 21:19.476
Oh, I wouldn't get too serious.

21:19.735 --> 21:22.966
Yeah. Everypony knows the
secret to good Buckball

21:23.052 --> 21:24.898
is just having fun!
