WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:10.542
Oops! Sorry, Princess Twilight!
That was meant for her!

00:12.345 --> 00:14.279
INCOMING!

00:14.481 --> 00:14.931
Whoa!

00:18.952 --> 00:20.886
Toola Roola! Coconut Cream!

00:21.088 --> 00:22.221
What are you doing?

00:22.623 --> 00:25.390
That was meant for
my ex-friend!

00:25.692 --> 00:27.592
I'm not your ex-friend!

00:27.694 --> 00:29.461
You're my ex-friend!

00:34.067 --> 00:35.334
Both of you, stop!

00:37.937 --> 00:40.506
So you see, friendship
isn't always easy

00:40.708 --> 00:43.342
but there's no doubt
it's worth fighting for.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.177
Awwww!

00:47.314 --> 00:49.381
Hmm. That sounds familiar.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.888
Hmmm. No. Uh uh.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.896
Aha! Here it is!

01:06.466 --> 01:07.699
What is that?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.000
Come on, Starlight.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.669
Don't judge a book by its cover.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.639
This is the friendship journal
my friends and I used to keep.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.774
It's filled with all the
things we've learned!

01:15.876 --> 01:18.343
Like... "friendship
isn't always easy

01:18.445 --> 01:20.779
but there's no doubt it's
worth fighting for."

01:24.384 --> 01:27.419
I'll.. judge a book by its
cover just this once.

02:10.597 --> 02:11.964
Thanks for coming, everypony!

02:12.366 --> 02:13.899
I've got a surprise for you...

02:14.201 --> 02:17.036
What is it, Twilight? Do I
need to prepare myself?

02:17.738 --> 02:19.003
It's this!

02:19.572 --> 02:21.173
Oh! What is that thing?

02:21.275 --> 02:22.841
Why is it so smelly!

02:23.243 --> 02:24.577
Wait a minute!

02:25.179 --> 02:27.212
[gasp] Is this our old
friendship journal?

02:27.314 --> 02:29.181
I haven't seen this
thing in forever!

02:29.483 --> 02:33.152
Hooo-wee, it's lookin' a
little uh, overripe.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.486
I'll say!

02:36.789 --> 02:39.524
There's a smooshed apple
in Applejack's lessons.

02:42.795 --> 02:46.465
Fluttershy's lessons are so
small, you can barely read them.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.568
I.. uh.. wanted to leave
room for all of you.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.341
I-I don't even
know what this is.

02:57.543 --> 03:00.079
It is called
calligraphy, darling.

03:00.281 --> 03:03.515
If you're going to make words,
at least make them fabulous.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.787
Looks like you got a
little aggressive

03:08.889 --> 03:10.756
with your friendship
lessons, Rainbow Dash.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.257
What can I say?

03:12.359 --> 03:14.926
When I learn something,
I learn it hard.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.864
I found Pinkie's page.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.334
Hee hee! Well, I
am surprised!

03:22.736 --> 03:24.603
That wasn't
the only surprise..

03:38.886 --> 03:40.084
<i> ♪ Ta da! ♪</i>

03:40.286 --> 03:43.121
Starlight and I decided to
make one for each of you!

03:43.223 --> 03:46.058
That's amazin'!
A perfect copy!

03:46.260 --> 03:48.560
I learned the spell years ago
when I needed to make copies

03:48.662 --> 03:49.594
of a certain...

03:52.399 --> 03:53.599
...manifesto.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.703
Ah! Even better than
a perfect copy.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.839
Oh, I'd forgotten all
about this lesson.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.075
Ha ha! Remember this one?

04:04.377 --> 04:05.711
From when I helped Daring Do?

04:06.013 --> 04:08.446
"Never underestimate
the power of friends

04:08.548 --> 04:10.048
who've always got your back."

04:10.350 --> 04:11.916
Aww, Cheese Sandwich!

04:12.118 --> 04:12.918
Party cannon!

04:13.020 --> 04:14.720
Ah! Birthaversary!

04:15.022 --> 04:16.688
After Twilight
remembered the journal,

04:16.890 --> 04:19.191
I had so much fun reading all
the stuff you've all learned.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.126
I just had to have
my own copy.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.895
And that brings me to the
second part of the surprise.

04:23.997 --> 04:24.963
My idea.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.532
How would you girls feel
about making our journal

04:27.634 --> 04:29.134
available for everypony?

04:29.236 --> 04:31.736
If we can get these lessons
into other ponies' hooves,

04:31.838 --> 04:33.572
maybe they'll benefit from them.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.241
Well, I think
that's a great idea.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.844
I'm in! YAY!

04:39.146 --> 04:40.845
We always said we wanted to.

04:41.047 --> 04:42.481
Sounds fabulous.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.850
Hahaha, I'm awesome.

04:47.286 --> 04:49.154
Oh, yeah, uh, good idea.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.591
Toola Roola: <i>No! I don't want to</i>
<i>play with you anymore!</i>

05:26.993 --> 05:29.828
Why not? You love
playing hopscotch.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.899
No,<i> you</i> do. Because
you always win!

05:34.401 --> 05:35.200
<i> Twilight: Hey, girls.</i>

05:35.302 --> 05:36.601
Couldn't help but overhear...

05:36.703 --> 05:38.170
You might want to
take a breather,

05:38.272 --> 05:41.072
maybe read Rainbow Dash's
chapter on Rainbow Falls.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.074
It might help.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.176
Sure, Princess.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.011
Apple Bloom: <i>Thanks, Twilight!</i>

05:46.313 --> 05:49.047
The friendship journal's
makin' us super popular!

05:49.749 --> 05:50.449
Oh...

05:50.751 --> 05:52.117
We were thinkin' of
putting together

05:52.219 --> 05:53.585
a Cutie Mark Summer Camp.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.521
Now everypony's definitely
gonna sign up for it!

05:56.923 --> 05:59.023
This is going to be awesome! Heh heh.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.262
A Cutie Mark Camp
is a great idea.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.130
Yeah, but the purpose
of the journal

06:05.232 --> 06:06.998
isn't supposed to
be marketing.

06:09.335 --> 06:11.736
I just hope those foals
actually learn something

06:11.838 --> 06:12.736
from our lessons.

06:12.838 --> 06:16.841
They will. I'm sure ponies all
across Equestria will--woah!

06:20.379 --> 06:21.546
Uh, hello.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.448
Can I... help you?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.417
We're here all the way
from Fillydelphia

06:25.519 --> 06:27.886
because we got copies of
your friendship journal.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.288
Wow! How wonderful.

06:30.490 --> 06:31.556
What was your favorite
friendship--

06:31.658 --> 06:32.424
Will you sign them?

06:33.793 --> 06:36.094
Oh. Uh, I guess so.

06:37.196 --> 06:39.264
So, what did you
think of the lessons?

06:39.866 --> 06:40.965
Oh, we haven't read them.

06:41.067 --> 06:41.865
These are keepsakes.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.302
We gotta keep them
in mint condition. Heh.

06:45.237 --> 06:45.904
Oh.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.174
Wow, that was worth the trip!

06:54.680 --> 06:57.816
Don't worry, Twilight, I'm
sure lots of other ponies

06:57.918 --> 06:59.951
are being inspired to
be better friends.

07:00.353 --> 07:03.521
Well, I for one found the
journal terribly illuminating.

07:03.645 --> 07:04.056
Ah!

07:04.957 --> 07:05.791
I agree.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.427
I'm seeing sides of these
ponies I didn't know were there.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.929
I only wish they'd
left Rarity out.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.532
She clearly doesn't belong in
that book with the rest of them.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.100
Oh, I know!

07:15.402 --> 07:16.768
Who does she think she is?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.837
Certainly she did a
fine job setting up the

07:18.939 --> 07:20.205
Ponyville Days Celebration,

07:20.307 --> 07:22.073
but does she really
believe it was a success

07:22.175 --> 07:23.174
just because of her?

07:23.276 --> 07:24.442
Ha ha ha!

07:24.544 --> 07:25.543
The nerve!

07:30.117 --> 07:31.983
But that's not what
she was saying!

07:32.185 --> 07:33.117
Rarity!

07:41.594 --> 07:42.995
Oh. Poor Rarity.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.931
She overheard all the mean
things those ponies were saying!

07:46.133 --> 07:47.633
She must be devastated.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.100
I'm going after her.

07:49.202 --> 07:49.902
Go ahead.

07:50.004 --> 07:52.571
I'm going to have a
chat with these two.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.210
Rarity, wait!

07:58.511 --> 07:59.154
Agh!

07:59.279 --> 08:00.812
Twilight, isn't it amazing?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.814
Our journals are everywhere!

08:03.416 --> 08:04.316
Pinkie! I've got to--

08:04.418 --> 08:05.617
Ponies keep stopping
by to tell me

08:05.719 --> 08:07.552
my entries are hilarious!

08:11.558 --> 08:13.859
I even had somepony come all
the way from Las Pegasus

08:13.961 --> 08:15.828
to say how much he
liked my lessons!

08:16.130 --> 08:18.997
I am so glad to hear
someponies are being inspired

08:19.099 --> 08:19.798
by the journal!

08:19.900 --> 08:22.834
Hey look! There's Pinkie
Pie, the funny one!

08:25.539 --> 08:27.406
Giggly feedback
is the best kind!

08:29.543 --> 08:31.744
Well, at least you're
getting a positive reaction.

08:32.246 --> 08:33.344
I just saw Rarity.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.880
I'm afraid this whole journal
thing really upset her.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.283
Aww. That's too bad.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.722
Wait, that wasn't
even funny.

08:45.459 --> 08:48.727
OK. Well, I guess
I'll catch you later.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.667
Yup. Bye, Twilight.

09:00.141 --> 09:01.907
Ha! Classic Pinkie!

09:02.009 --> 09:03.909
Oh! She's even funnier
in real life!

09:04.211 --> 09:05.777
You've known
me for years!

09:13.320 --> 09:14.887
Rainbow Dash: Maybe it's
time to call it a day.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.390
I ripped out all the Twilight
Sparkle lessons

09:18.492 --> 09:20.592
'cause they were getting in
the way of the good ones!

09:21.094 --> 09:22.428
What do you mean you
skipped the lessons?

09:22.530 --> 09:24.997
We've all had
valuable experiences!

09:25.299 --> 09:27.032
Hey, here's a great idea!

09:27.534 --> 09:30.369
Why don't you guys talk to
Twilight for a while

09:30.471 --> 09:33.538
so I can get back to things
like working and napping and...

09:33.740 --> 09:35.608
well, pretty much anything else.

09:36.110 --> 09:38.777
Aw, we don't want to
hear her boring lessons!

09:38.879 --> 09:42.014
Come on, tell us again about
when you met Daring Do!

09:42.716 --> 09:44.817
Heh heh. Again?

09:45.319 --> 09:46.718
Haven't we already
covered that one?

09:47.120 --> 09:48.487
A couple dozen times?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.289
We can't get enough of it!

09:50.391 --> 09:52.991
Come on, you don't want
to disappoint your fans!

09:55.395 --> 09:59.164
Uh.. It's just that I, uh,
really need to get those

09:59.266 --> 10:02.001
stormclouds back
in their.... pens.

10:02.303 --> 10:05.671
Cool! We'll come along and you
can tell us the story there!

10:06.073 --> 10:10.008
Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash!

10:13.770 --> 10:14.247
Oooh..

10:14.448 --> 10:15.514
What's going on now?

10:19.752 --> 10:22.389
Please! Just leave me alone!

10:24.391 --> 10:26.157
Fluttershy? What's wrong?

10:26.259 --> 10:28.193
We want answers!

10:28.295 --> 10:29.895
Yeah! We're
entitled to know!

10:30.397 --> 10:31.864
What is it, everypony?

10:32.266 --> 10:34.065
We want to know why
Fluttershy keeps learning

10:34.167 --> 10:35.467
the same thing over
and over again.

10:35.569 --> 10:36.802
Be assertive, already.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.504
Even I've learned
more than she has!

10:39.606 --> 10:41.206
Why can't I be in the book?

10:41.508 --> 10:44.843
What? Really? Are you
attacking my friend

10:44.945 --> 10:46.445
because you want
to be in a book?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.914
It's OK. I've
got this, girls.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.651
Listen up! I<i> am</i>
more assertive.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.153
And yes, it took me
a while to get there.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.456
But can you honestly say that
you could learn something

10:57.558 --> 10:59.224
one time and completely
change who you are?

11:00.927 --> 11:02.261
I didn't think so!

11:02.763 --> 11:06.431
Wow. You're way different from
the Fluttershy in the book.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.401
I don't know how
I feel about that.

11:15.241 --> 11:17.109
It feels like
everypony in Equestria

11:17.211 --> 11:19.478
is missing the friendship part
of the friendship journals.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.250
Rarity? Are you all right?

11:25.352 --> 11:25.884
Gah!

11:28.254 --> 11:29.255
What are you doing?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.957
Why I'm creating
a gown, darling!

11:32.959 --> 11:33.959
For what?

11:34.261 --> 11:34.960
I don't know!

11:35.062 --> 11:36.094
I'm stress-sewing!

11:37.897 --> 11:38.764
Stress-sewing?

11:38.966 --> 11:40.932
When I overheard those
two at the cafe,

11:41.134 --> 11:42.200
I suddenly understood why

11:42.302 --> 11:44.269
I've been getting
cancellations for days!

11:44.671 --> 11:47.473
What? Why are ponies
cancelling their orders?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.775
Because.. nopony
likes me anymore!

11:50.977 --> 11:52.411
They're boycotting me!

11:59.720 --> 12:01.753
I'm sure if I go out there
and talk to those ponies,

12:01.855 --> 12:03.455
they'll see that they're
being unreasonable.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.659
I need a hundred blankets
and I need 'em now!

12:08.061 --> 12:08.827
Sorry, Twilight.

12:10.630 --> 12:13.032
Right away, Pony
who still likes me!

12:13.634 --> 12:14.966
I don't need nothin' fancy.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.703
What's the matter, Applejack?

12:18.505 --> 12:19.905
I'm popular, Twilight!

12:20.107 --> 12:22.507
I'm popular and I
don't like it one bit!

12:24.944 --> 12:27.178
You go ahead, I'll stay here.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.176
Applejack, who are
all these ponies?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.846
They call themselves "the
Sweet Apple Admirers."

13:01.248 --> 13:02.748
They say they read
my journal entries

13:02.950 --> 13:04.783
and they felt like a
part of the family.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.586
And now they want to actually
become part of the family!

13:10.456 --> 13:11.657
Your journal entries?

13:12.859 --> 13:15.026
Yeah, you know, all the stuff
about how friends are like

13:15.128 --> 13:16.061
family and whatnot.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.596
Can't you get rid of them?

13:17.798 --> 13:19.598
And kick out my own family?

13:21.200 --> 13:21.900
Granny Smith!

13:22.002 --> 13:23.602
Hang on, let me help!

13:25.538 --> 13:27.072
There she is!

13:27.274 --> 13:29.674
YEEEEEE-HAAWWWW!

13:31.444 --> 13:34.846
Oh. I wish we'd never
released that journal.

13:42.055 --> 13:42.753
There you are.

13:42.855 --> 13:46.124
OK. I just left Rarity; I
think she's doing better and-

13:46.926 --> 13:47.826
Oh, boy.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.561
Window staring, huh?

13:49.763 --> 13:51.830
Was it that bad at
Sweet Apple Acres?

13:52.232 --> 13:53.331
It's bad everywhere.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.066
I thought I was
doing something good.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.034
I thought I was helping.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.636
How could our friendship
journal have led to so much...

13:59.138 --> 14:00.205
anti-friendship!?

14:00.707 --> 14:02.774
Oh, Twilight, it's
not your fault.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.542
Of course it's my fault!

14:04.744 --> 14:06.878
If I hadn't had the big
idea to make copies,

14:07.080 --> 14:08.113
none of this would
be happening!

14:08.515 --> 14:11.316
I'm afraid I made life
awful for my friends.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.918
I really think you're
being too hard on yourself.

14:14.320 --> 14:14.953
Am I?

14:18.893 --> 14:19.393
Wah!

14:28.268 --> 14:29.501
I didn't know where else to go.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.671
I've got so much cookin' and
cleanin' and familyin' to do,

14:32.873 --> 14:34.807
I ain't got time
for anything else!

14:35.809 --> 14:38.143
At least ponies aren't
laughing every time you talk!

14:38.645 --> 14:41.012
Not even I want to be
funny all the time!

14:41.214 --> 14:44.415
I'm telling you, my days
of hilariosityness... ness...

14:44.817 --> 14:45.616
are OVER.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.653
You think you've got problems?

14:48.855 --> 14:52.390
I know I'm awesome but I can't
even go to the bathroom

14:52.492 --> 14:55.227
without somepony trying to
tell me how cool I am.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.930
Uh...Rarity, what
are you wearing?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.431
My emotions, darling!

15:00.533 --> 15:01.767
Stress couture!

15:02.369 --> 15:05.236
I don't know what I'm going to
do if I have to defend myself

15:05.338 --> 15:07.171
one more time!

15:10.175 --> 15:12.377
Oh. Er.. sorry, Darling.
Force of habit.

15:20.452 --> 15:23.922
OK, so maybe they are
having a hard time with it.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.124
That doesn't mean you
did anything wrong.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.258
Yes, I did!

15:27.560 --> 15:29.628
Releasing the
journal was my idea

15:30.030 --> 15:32.664
and it backfired in ways I
could never have imagined.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.332
It's not your fault.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.000
It's everypony else's!

15:36.202 --> 15:38.369
They're just focusing
on the wrong things and-

15:39.706 --> 15:40.371
Wait here!

15:40.473 --> 15:41.272
I've got an idea!

15:42.675 --> 15:44.042
I can't wait any longer.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.576
I've got to fix this.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.116
Everypony, please stop!

15:55.088 --> 15:55.886
Princess Twilight?

15:55.988 --> 15:57.788
I'm with the Canterlot
Chronicle, quick question...

15:57.990 --> 16:00.024
What would you say to ponies
who wonder why you moved

16:00.126 --> 16:01.159
to Ponyville in the first place?

16:01.661 --> 16:03.528
I moved here to learn
about friendship.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.663
That's why the
journal even exists.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.467
It took some time for me
to get the hang of it,

16:09.969 --> 16:12.470
but it was each of these
ponies standing next to me

16:12.572 --> 16:14.405
who taught me the lessons
in those journals.

16:14.907 --> 16:15.706
Applejack.

16:16.008 --> 16:16.741
Pinkie Pie.

16:17.043 --> 16:17.942
Rainbow Dash.

16:18.144 --> 16:18.843
Rarity.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.211
And Fluttershy, too.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.080
Then it was all of you.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.115
I've learned so much
from--

16:24.217 --> 16:26.684
What I mean is, some
ponies would argue that

16:26.786 --> 16:29.387
it doesn't seem believable that
the six of you would be friends.

16:29.789 --> 16:30.889
Believable?

16:31.191 --> 16:31.957
Well, sure.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.292
I read this journal cover
to cover and I have to say,

16:34.394 --> 16:36.161
your character would have
been much more interesting

16:36.363 --> 16:38.096
if she'd stayed in Canterlot.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.397
My character!?

16:39.799 --> 16:41.132
We are real ponies.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.800
This journal is a
record of things

16:42.902 --> 16:44.669
that actually
happened to us.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.205
We made mistakes and
we learned from them.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.107
What about Rarity?

16:49.209 --> 16:51.142
Are we really supposed to
believe she learned anything

16:51.244 --> 16:52.343
she wrote in there?

16:52.645 --> 16:54.679
That's why you
gotta be Team Dash!

16:54.881 --> 16:57.315
She's the only one who didn't
really need to learn anything

16:57.417 --> 16:59.317
because she was already so cool!

16:59.719 --> 17:02.120
Twilight was better
before she got wings.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.889
Fluttershy is just
so painfully shy,

17:04.991 --> 17:06.991
it's hard to relate.
I mean, come on!

17:11.197 --> 17:12.331
Wait a minute, everypony!

17:13.033 --> 17:16.100
Are Pinkie Pie and
Applejack related or what?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.441
Listen to me!

17:23.943 --> 17:26.075

19:43.081 --> 19:44.548
So you see, everypony?

19:44.650 --> 19:46.717
None of us ever
claimed to be perfect.

19:47.019 --> 19:47.952
Without our flaws,

19:48.154 --> 19:50.288
there wouldn't be any
friendship lessons to learn.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.290
Without our flaws...

19:52.492 --> 19:54.993
... there probably wouldn't
be any friendships at all.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.206
So that just
happened.

20:09.308 --> 20:12.042
Girls! I found two ponies
who have something

20:12.144 --> 20:13.378
I think you should hear.

20:13.480 --> 20:17.849
Um... we just wanted to say
thank you to all of you.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.051
Yeah. Our friendship...

20:20.353 --> 20:23.387
well, we were having trouble
until we read your journal.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.791
It showed us that friends can go
through all sorts of tough times

20:26.893 --> 20:28.826
and come through
stronger than before.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.429
It's made us better friends
than we've ever been.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.097
Really?

20:33.299 --> 20:34.766
Mm-hm.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.569
Oh, I can't tell you how
much it means to hear that.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.605
Thank you for telling us.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.373
We've had a tough
couple of days.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.675
But knowing we've helped
fillies like you...

20:45.077 --> 20:47.512
It makes everything we've
been through worth it.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.213
Absolutely.

20:49.315 --> 20:52.383
Fads come and go;
friendship is forever.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.853
There are worse things than
not being able to do anything

20:55.955 --> 20:57.789
without being told I'm awesome.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.858
And we can't change the way
other ponies think about us,

21:01.160 --> 21:03.561
but we can change how
we let it affect us.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.030
Or how we don't
let it affect us.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.401
Heh. Heh. Go ahead. Laugh!

21:20.512 --> 21:23.648
Reckon we still have to
deal with them, don't we?

21:27.919 --> 21:29.554
Stay in the friendship
moment, Applejack.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.689
They can wait a little longer.
