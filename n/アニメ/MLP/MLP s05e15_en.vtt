00:09.360 --> 00:11.824
Oh, Sassy Saddles,
don't you just love

00:11.824 --> 00:14.448
my new Femme Mystique
Chic line of gowns?

00:14.912 --> 00:17.840
Sequins and sashes,
Rarity, they're exquisite!

00:18.080 --> 00:20.400
Where in Equestria did
you find the inspiration?

00:20.672 --> 00:24.512
Ooh. I modeled them after The
Adventures of Shadow Spade.

00:24.720 --> 00:28.112
Her stories are always full
of mystery and suspense.

00:28.112 --> 00:31.248
And best of all?
Fabulous costumes!

00:31.968 --> 00:33.472
They're perfect.

00:34.304 --> 00:35.152
What are you doing?

00:37.024 --> 00:39.360
Oh, uh, just making
some minor adjustments.

00:42.032 --> 00:44.320
Shadow Spade believes
it all comes down

00:44.320 --> 00:46.816
to attention to
detail. And so do I.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.560
There! Now it's perfect!

00:51.680 --> 00:52.992
Hey guys! How's it--

00:55.392 --> 00:58.352
Heh heh heh. My bad!

00:58.352 --> 01:00.350
Hearing impaired subtitles

We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

01:37.872 --> 01:40.160
Sorry I messed up
your dress thingie.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.260
Nothing we can't
fix in a stitch.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.530
What are you doing
in Canterlot?

01:45.744 --> 01:48.608
I'm here for Princess Celestia's
Royal Garden Opening tomorrow.

01:49.008 --> 01:49.920
Oh, yes.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.600
Rumor has it the gardens are
especially lush this season.

01:53.888 --> 01:56.432
I've heard that the Wonderbolts
will be kicking things off

01:56.432 --> 01:57.840
with an aerial display.

01:58.688 --> 01:59.850
You heard right.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.048
And Rainbow Dash is
here to fly with them.

02:02.176 --> 02:03.168
So exciting!

02:03.490 --> 02:07.232
Well, kind of exciting.
Technically I'm not flying.

02:07.552 --> 02:09.408
I'm just the lucky
reserve who was called in

02:09.408 --> 02:11.904
to be the back-up flier in case
a Wonderbolt can't perform.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.208
Oh, don't be so modest!

02:14.464 --> 02:17.130
Out of all the reserves,
you were the one chosen.

02:17.440 --> 02:19.168
It is pretty sweet.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.072
And I do get to
stay in the castle,

02:21.200 --> 02:22.464
hang out with
the Wonderbolts,

02:22.512 --> 02:24.608
and eat awesome food
at the dinner tonight!

02:25.072 --> 02:27.568
Speaking of the dinner,
you're still coming right?

02:27.872 --> 02:28.880
Heavens yes!

02:29.248 --> 02:31.904
A chance to dress up, be
charming and show off

02:31.904 --> 02:33.600
my newest femme
mystique couture?

02:34.464 --> 02:36.496
I wouldn't miss it
for all of Equestia.

02:36.992 --> 02:38.464
Great. See you tonight!

02:46.768 --> 02:49.160
Ooh, the rhinestones
I ordered!

02:51.952 --> 02:54.896
Oh, my, oh, there's
been a mistake!

02:55.264 --> 02:58.768
I ordered dragon cut stones
and these are hoof-polished.

02:59.136 --> 03:01.984
I'm sorry, but I've got a full
load of deliveries today.

03:01.984 --> 03:04.256
I'm not sure I have
time to redo your order.

03:08.624 --> 03:12.608
Of course you don't!
Your job is so difficult.

03:12.976 --> 03:16.576
Honestly, I don't know how you
keep all those orders straight!

03:17.680 --> 03:21.840
It is pretty tough, what with
the boxes all being box-shaped.

03:22.992 --> 03:26.384
Oh, yes, and I very
much appreciate it.

03:26.816 --> 03:29.040
But if there was any
way you could squeeze in

03:29.040 --> 03:32.912
one more little delivery, I
would be eternally grateful.

03:36.432 --> 03:39.984
Ha ha ha. Well, for you,
Rarity, I'll see what I can do.

03:42.432 --> 03:45.790
Rarity, you could sweet
talk a filly out of candy!

03:46.080 --> 03:49.520
Oh, it was nothing. No
pony minds a compliment!

03:49.984 --> 03:53.040
Now, you simply must help me
pick out an outfit for tonight.

03:53.376 --> 03:55.280
Something from the new
collection, of course.

04:08.368 --> 04:09.568
Let's grab some grub!

04:15.632 --> 04:18.360
Mmmmm. Is that
Juniper Phoenix I smell?

04:18.640 --> 04:19.712
No, it's broccoli!

04:21.936 --> 04:25.696
<i>Yeah, Juniper Phoenix is one of</i>
<i> my favorite stallion colognes.</i>

04:26.576 --> 04:29.456
Mine as well. It's
masculine, and yet soft,

04:29.680 --> 04:31.936
with the barest hint of
floral notes and a --

04:31.936 --> 04:34.400
Rarity, don't you
know who this is?

04:39.120 --> 04:42.048
A gentlepony with fabulous
taste in colognes and scarves?

04:43.184 --> 04:44.944
It's Wind Rider!

04:45.840 --> 04:47.888
Oh! So nice to meet you.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.960
You didn't let me finish!
He's a living legend!

04:51.232 --> 04:54.096
He holds the Wonderbolt record
in the Mustang Marathon.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.576
Well, that was a
long time ago.

04:56.848 --> 04:59.860
Honestly, I can't believe
I still hold the record.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.530
Wind Rider, I see
you met Rainbow Dash!

05:02.816 --> 05:04.912
She's one of our most
promising reserves.

05:05.296 --> 05:06.944
She just might
beat your record!

05:07.600 --> 05:08.256
Really now?

05:08.432 --> 05:11.264
Oh, I'm nowhere
near as good as you.

05:11.584 --> 05:14.400
I mean I'm fast, but I
don't have the endurance

05:14.400 --> 05:15.648
to go long distances.

05:16.432 --> 05:18.672
Don't be modest.
A little practice

05:18.672 --> 05:20.576
and you'll be beating
records in no time.

05:21.984 --> 05:25.120
Heh heh. Well, it's nice
to meet you fillies.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.600
Not as nice as
it is to meet you, sir.

05:30.656 --> 05:33.312
I can't believe I
just met Wind Rider!

05:33.610 --> 05:35.584
Yeah. He's coming
out of retirement

05:35.584 --> 05:37.770
to take the spot of honor
in the center of our

05:37.776 --> 05:39.680
aerial flower
formation tomorrow!

05:40.432 --> 05:42.528
Really? That's incredible!

05:47.904 --> 05:50.320
Guess I'll just watch
Wind Rider being awesome

05:50.320 --> 05:51.536
from the sidelines.

05:52.096 --> 05:54.850
Practice tomorrow is
gonna be so boring.

05:55.136 --> 05:57.264
I don't suppose I
could keep you company?

05:58.064 --> 05:58.720
You could!

05:59.008 --> 06:01.504
They always let friends and
family come watch practices.

06:02.448 --> 06:03.008
Oh!

06:04.512 --> 06:06.928
Sorry about that. Let
me help clean that up.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.936
No no. It's almost impossible
to get stains out of silk.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.312
But not to worry...

06:16.048 --> 06:17.184
I've come prepared.

06:21.312 --> 06:24.992
That dinner was absolutely
divine! Thanks for inviting me.

06:25.888 --> 06:27.950
Ooh! You're staying
in the east tower?

06:28.256 --> 06:30.550
Those rooms have the
best view of Canterlot.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.120
How lucky are we?

06:32.576 --> 06:35.280
Well, we better get some
shuteye before practice.

06:36.432 --> 06:37.776
See you tomorrow, Rarity!

06:37.968 --> 06:39.184
Good night!

06:48.784 --> 06:50.416
Thanks for keeping
me company, Rarity.

06:50.688 --> 06:51.552
If you weren't here...

06:51.984 --> 06:54.448
well, I don't know who I'd
be talking to right now.

06:56.736 --> 06:57.872
You'd be talking to me.

06:58.624 --> 07:01.152
Rainbow Dash, Spitfire's
mom sent a message

07:01.152 --> 07:03.840
that she was sick. She had to
leave to take care of her.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.152
Oh, no! I hope her mom's OK!

07:07.552 --> 07:12.160
Me too. In the meantime, we
need you to fly in her place.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.328
L-l-like in the actual show?

07:15.664 --> 07:17.616
Unless Spitfire comes back, yes.

07:18.544 --> 07:20.512
I won't let you down, Soarin!

07:21.280 --> 07:25.152
AAAAH! This is the
best thing EVERRR!

07:25.440 --> 07:27.424
Oh, my gosh oh my gosh
oh my gosh oh my gosh!

07:27.710 --> 07:31.440
<i>♪ I'm gonna get to fly with Wind</i>
<i> Rider! And the Wonderbolts! ♪</i>

07:31.600 --> 07:35.280
<i>♪ Cause I'm the bestest! And I'm</i>
<i> awesome! And they know it! ♪</i>

07:35.360 --> 07:36.920
Uhhh. Rainbow Dash?

07:37.024 --> 07:38.848
Sh sh. Let her
have this, darling.

07:53.008 --> 07:54.912
Hello, there. Friend or family?

07:55.184 --> 07:57.280
Family. My daughter's
a Wonderbolt.

07:57.536 --> 08:00.512
But I don't see her up
there. Do you know Spitfire?

08:00.816 --> 08:04.944
Oh, you're Spitfire's mom?
But I thought you were sick!

08:05.312 --> 08:05.910
What?

08:06.192 --> 08:07.648
Well, Spitfire got
a note from you

08:07.648 --> 08:08.720
saying you weren't
feeling well

08:08.736 --> 08:10.704
and she went home
to take care of you!

08:10.992 --> 08:12.160
I didn't send a note.

08:12.592 --> 08:14.208
That's so strange.

08:14.752 --> 08:17.616
Stormy Flare? Aren't you
supposed to be sick?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.024
OK, what's happening?

08:19.456 --> 08:23.280
I don't know, but I do know I
didn't send my daughter a note.

08:23.648 --> 08:26.496
Could somepony have sent
Spitfire a fake note?

08:26.944 --> 08:28.500
Who would do such a thing?

08:28.640 --> 08:31.360
Somepony who wanted her
out of the show, I suppose.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.344
Why would anypony want that?

08:33.632 --> 08:36.192
Maybe so that they
could take her spot.

08:44.256 --> 08:47.296
Me? I would never
do that to Spitfire.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.024
Why would you think it was me?

08:49.424 --> 08:51.984
I did see you and Spitfire
leave the dinner together.

08:52.272 --> 08:53.872
We were room neighbors
in the castle!

08:54.144 --> 08:57.728
And you did say you would do
anything to fly with Wind Rider!

08:58.128 --> 09:00.640
Yeah, but I didn't
mean anything!

09:00.960 --> 09:02.672
Spitfire came by my room

09:02.672 --> 09:05.440
and told me she had to go see
her mom at around midnight.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.152
Where were you then?

09:07.808 --> 09:11.456
I was asleep at midnight, having
this totally amazing dream.

09:11.744 --> 09:14.784
There I was at the arena,
flying with Wind Rider

09:14.784 --> 09:17.648
and the Wonderbolts, like
I've always wanted to--

09:19.568 --> 09:21.504
Never mind. Not helping.

09:26.490 --> 09:29.824
Rainbow Dash, if you can prove
that somepony else is behind

09:29.824 --> 09:32.528
Spitfire's disappearance
before the start of the show,

09:33.104 --> 09:34.770
then you can still fly with us.

09:35.232 --> 09:37.328
In the meantime,
Misty Fly, Blaze,

09:37.560 --> 09:40.624
head over to Stormy Flare's
house and try to find Spitfire

09:40.624 --> 09:41.470
and bring her back.

09:43.136 --> 09:45.888
I have to warn you, if
you sent that letter,

09:46.192 --> 09:48.992
the bylaws are clear;
I'd have no choice

09:48.992 --> 09:52.690
but to ban you from the
Wonderbolts forever. Understand?

09:54.112 --> 09:58.192
I understand. But how am I gonna
prove I didn't send a letter

09:58.270 --> 09:59.520
that I didn't send?

10:00.160 --> 10:01.328
With me!

10:03.088 --> 10:04.912
Detective Rarity is on the case!

10:05.456 --> 10:07.296
And we're going to get
to the bottom of this

10:07.296 --> 10:08.940
faster than my
costume change!

10:09.184 --> 10:11.248
Yeah, what's
with the get-up?

10:11.680 --> 10:14.528
Obviously, I am
channeling Shadow Spade

10:14.528 --> 10:16.000
through these
gorgeous garments.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.984
And she would say that
the best way to prove

10:17.984 --> 10:20.736
that you didn't send the letter
is to find out whoever did!

10:21.130 --> 10:23.376
First stop, the
scene of the crime!

10:26.880 --> 10:29.488
<i>We had a long road ahead</i>
<i> of us, Rainbow Dash and I.</i>

10:30.320 --> 10:32.880
<i> Well, not too long because</i>
<i> we didn't have much time</i>

10:32.880 --> 10:36.288
<i> but the point is, I was</i>
<i> up for the challenge.</i>

10:42.480 --> 10:44.592
There I was, surveying
the crime scene

10:45.600 --> 10:47.376
and looking tres
chic while doing it.

10:51.696 --> 10:54.480
This must be the envelope
for the letter Spitfire got!

10:58.448 --> 11:03.248
Hmm, these look like
hairs from a rainbow mane!

11:04.400 --> 11:05.390
That's not good.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.712
<i>Rainbow Dash was getting antsy.</i>

11:10.128 --> 11:11.840
<i> But I had faith I</i>
<i> could clear her name</i>

11:11.840 --> 11:13.696
<i> and find the real culprit.</i>

11:14.768 --> 11:15.664
What are you doing?

11:16.032 --> 11:17.744
Huh, oh what? Oh,
just thinking thoughts.

11:19.856 --> 11:22.944
<i> Rainbow Dash was right. In</i>
<i> order to solve the mystery,</i>

11:22.940 --> 11:27.840
<i> we had to be focused, driven,</i>
<i> one hundred percent in the--</i>

11:27.840 --> 11:29.008
Ooh!

11:29.296 --> 11:31.856
The damask pattern on these
curtains is exquisite!

11:32.256 --> 11:35.344
Oh, and this velvet
rope holder, oh it's--

11:35.744 --> 11:37.648
We don't have time
to look at the decor!

11:37.856 --> 11:39.600
They're gonna kick me
out of the Wonderbolts

11:39.600 --> 11:41.024
unless we solve this thing!

11:41.216 --> 11:43.392
I know, Rainbow, and
I am on this case

11:43.392 --> 11:44.656
like a charm on a bracelet.

11:44.928 --> 11:46.240
Here's what I'm thinking:

11:46.528 --> 11:49.472
somepony had to bring
Spitfire that letter,

11:49.472 --> 11:52.912
which means somepony
must have seen them!

11:56.288 --> 11:58.032
I just have a few
questions for you

11:58.464 --> 12:01.024
and I'm sure once we get some
things cleared up, we'll--

12:01.120 --> 12:03.520
C'mon, Rarity; we
don't have all day!

12:04.192 --> 12:06.448
Where were you on the night
of last night at midnight?

12:06.768 --> 12:08.512
We were here, guarding
the hallway entrance

12:08.512 --> 12:09.424
like we were supposed to.

12:09.824 --> 12:11.280
A likely story.

12:11.632 --> 12:13.296
I'm telling you, we
were there all night

12:13.456 --> 12:15.840
and no one went in or
out of that hallway.

12:17.328 --> 12:18.048
Except for you.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.520
What are you trying to say?

12:19.840 --> 12:22.512
Just that there are only two
rooms in the northwest wing:

12:22.512 --> 12:24.140
yours and Spitfire's.

12:24.496 --> 12:28.624
So the only other pony who had
access to that wing was you.

12:30.704 --> 12:32.080
<i>The waters were getting choppy.</i>

12:32.560 --> 12:35.680
<i> Rainbow Dash's tactics</i>
<i> were... well, horrid.</i>

12:36.368 --> 12:38.096
<i> It was time for</i>
<i> another approach.</i>

12:38.816 --> 12:41.056
Perhaps I should
take it from here.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.976
You castle guards have
such a difficult job.

12:47.568 --> 12:51.376
I'm guessing that at times,
it can be rather boring.

12:52.500 --> 12:56.000
It is. I've counted all
345 bolts in the ceiling tiles

12:56.000 --> 12:57.248
293 times.

12:57.808 --> 13:01.310
And of course, being a castle
guard can be thankless work.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.720
I'm not saying you did,
but if you took a break,

13:04.960 --> 13:06.704
you more than deserved it.

13:07.424 --> 13:09.952
Aw, you're right, we don't
get a lot of recognition

13:09.952 --> 13:10.720
for what we do.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.760
Except for last night when
somepony was nice enough

13:13.760 --> 13:14.890
to leave a cake for us.

13:15.168 --> 13:18.090
So we did take one little
break when we ate that cake.

13:18.528 --> 13:19.664
What kind of cake was it?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.104
Cherry with a
custard filling.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.592
Was the frosting
vanilla or chocolate?

13:22.720 --> 13:23.104
Chocolate.

13:23.248 --> 13:25.136
Was it decorated with
buttercream rosettes?

13:25.264 --> 13:25.856
It was!

13:26.032 --> 13:28.976
Ugh. Who cares how
it was decorated?

13:29.392 --> 13:31.360
<i> Rainbow Dash was</i>
<i> questioning my methods,</i>

13:31.504 --> 13:33.248
<i> but I knew what I was doing.</i>

13:33.536 --> 13:34.128
Do you?

13:35.392 --> 13:37.910
Oh. Did I say that
one out loud?

13:38.288 --> 13:40.980
I mean, even I think I'm
guilty at this point.

13:41.328 --> 13:43.424
I really did want
to fly in that show!

13:43.808 --> 13:45.552
What if I wrote that
note when I was asleep?

13:46.064 --> 13:48.624
Do you know what I do when I
sleep? Because I sure don't!

13:48.864 --> 13:52.544
Oh, calm down, Rainbow Dash.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

13:53.088 --> 13:54.896
There's only one
bakery in Canterlot

13:54.890 --> 13:57.056
that makes a chocolate cherry
cake with custard filling

13:57.056 --> 13:59.296
and buttercream frosting
rosettes, and that's...

14:00.080 --> 14:02.512
...Cinnamon Chai's
Tea and Cake Shop!

14:03.584 --> 14:05.940
Hello, how can I help you?

14:06.256 --> 14:08.512
I've heard you have the best
chocolate cherry custard cake

14:08.512 --> 14:10.592
with buttercream frosting
rosettes in town!

14:10.880 --> 14:13.184
Oh! You travel in
the right circles.

14:13.392 --> 14:16.032
We have the only chocolate
cherry custard cake

14:16.032 --> 14:18.496
with buttercream frosting
rosettes in town.

14:19.696 --> 14:21.936
Oh, no! But somepony's
already bought it.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.680
Who was the lucky pony?

14:25.392 --> 14:26.992
I can't even say!

14:27.230 --> 14:29.904
Why? Because it was
somepony famous?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.656
No! Because it
was hard to tell.

14:34.272 --> 14:37.168
She was wearing a trenchcoat,
sunglasses, and a scarf

14:37.168 --> 14:39.696
around her head that
covered most of her face.

14:39.968 --> 14:44.000
But I do remember she had a
really deep, raspy voice.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.224
What do
you mean raspy?

14:46.656 --> 14:48.800
Well, kinda like yours.

14:50.416 --> 14:52.448
If there's anything else
you can remember, dish!

14:53.088 --> 14:55.600
Well, have I got
a story for you!

14:55.952 --> 14:57.824
The pony who bought the
cake threw a big fit

14:57.824 --> 15:01.264
when she accidentally got
chocolate ganache on her scarf.

15:01.408 --> 15:04.512
That's terrible! What
color was the scarf?

15:04.976 --> 15:08.800
White. No, maybe
more of an ivory.

15:09.264 --> 15:10.464
You don't say!

15:10.672 --> 15:13.792
I can't believe you're talking
fashion at a time like this.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.408
Rainbow, don't panic.
I need you to trust me.

15:17.580 --> 15:20.832
Trust you? You've spent
more time changing clothes

15:20.830 --> 15:23.664
than trying to help
me. I'm doomed!

15:24.336 --> 15:26.608
No, you're not. Come on!

15:36.000 --> 15:40.336
<i>Rainbow Dash was obviously upset</i>
<i>but I had all my ducks in a row,</i>

15:40.640 --> 15:42.160
<i> except for one.</i>

15:43.104 --> 15:45.920
<i> She was not going to like it,</i>
<i> but there was only one way</i>

15:45.920 --> 15:48.720
<i> to find out if my</i>
<i> suspicions were correct.</i>

15:53.760 --> 15:54.704
We looked everywhere,

15:54.928 --> 15:56.816
but Spitfire wasn't
at her mom's house.

15:57.072 --> 15:58.016
Where could she be?

16:00.800 --> 16:02.272
I've found the culprit!

16:04.928 --> 16:08.928
Somepony sent Spitfire away and
framed Rainbow Dash for it.

16:09.440 --> 16:14.800
And that pony was none
other than... WIND RIDER!

16:21.136 --> 16:24.176
Rarity, I can't believe you
would accuse Wind Rider

16:24.176 --> 16:25.040
of framing me.

16:25.344 --> 16:27.840
He's a living legend,
for pony's sake!

16:28.128 --> 16:30.336
All the evidence points to him.

16:31.248 --> 16:33.440
What evidence could
you possibly have?

16:33.744 --> 16:36.512
All you did was ask
about cake, admire decor,

16:36.512 --> 16:38.608
and change outfits
a gazillion times.

16:38.768 --> 16:39.632
Let me explain.

16:40.064 --> 16:42.432
I never believed you
would send Spitfire away.

16:42.736 --> 16:45.744
And when we found the rainbow
hairs in Spitfire's room,

16:46.176 --> 16:49.584
I could tell they didn't
fall out; they were cut!

16:50.864 --> 16:53.264
No pony loses hair in a chunk.

16:53.744 --> 16:56.272
And look at the ends;
it's a straight line!

16:56.480 --> 16:58.384
They were clearly
cut with shears!

16:58.656 --> 17:00.640
Which means somepony planted it.

17:01.184 --> 17:03.584
Then, when we were examining
Spitfire's room...

17:04.112 --> 17:08.032
...I smelled something on the
envelope. Juniper Phoenix!

17:08.336 --> 17:10.260
Wind Rider's cologne of choice.

17:10.750 --> 17:14.944
Then, in the castle hallway,
I noticed some of the damask

17:14.944 --> 17:17.104
curtains fell out of
their velvet rope holder,

17:17.296 --> 17:20.544
indicating that somepony had
been hiding behind them,

17:20.880 --> 17:23.472
perhaps after they dropped
off the fake letter.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.224
Juniper Phoenix is a
very popular fragrance

17:26.528 --> 17:28.544
and anypony could have
moved those curtains.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.920
Precisely why I questioned
the castle guards.

17:32.272 --> 17:34.400
They were at their post at
the entrance to the hallway

17:34.400 --> 17:37.632
all night except for
a small window of time

17:37.632 --> 17:39.760
when somepony brought them cake.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.816
A cake that was ordered by a
girl pony with a raspy voice.

17:45.104 --> 17:47.344
Whoever ordered the cake
got a chocolate stain

17:47.344 --> 17:51.280
on their ivory scarf, and
I couldn't help but notice

17:51.552 --> 17:54.128
Wind Rider's scarf is tied
in a tight Windsor knot

17:54.384 --> 17:56.464
instead of its usual
loose slipknot.

17:56.800 --> 18:01.744
And why is that? Is it to
hide... the chocolate stain?

18:04.064 --> 18:05.632
This is preposterous.

18:05.888 --> 18:08.640
Wonderbolts, you don't
believe a word of this, right?

18:09.392 --> 18:12.416
Just admit it! You're as
guilty of framing Rainbow Dash

18:12.416 --> 18:14.608
as you are of ruining
that ivory scarf!

18:15.680 --> 18:18.352
Fine. You caught me! I did it.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.800
But why, Wind Rider?

18:21.136 --> 18:22.848
Is it because I took
the last broccoli

18:22.848 --> 18:25.500
at the dinner and you
really really wanted it?

18:26.224 --> 18:28.528
No. It was because he was afraid

18:28.656 --> 18:31.856
that you would break his long
distance Wonderbolt record.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.112
I heard him when Spitfire said

18:34.112 --> 18:35.664
you were close to
breaking his record.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.400
He said and I quote, "heh heh."

18:39.120 --> 18:41.152
That's the polite but
disingenuous laugh you make

18:41.152 --> 18:43.520
when you want to seem happy
but really you're not.

18:43.952 --> 18:45.872
I thought if I could
get Rainbow Dash

18:45.872 --> 18:47.552
kicked out of the
Wonderbolts forever,

18:47.952 --> 18:49.690
my record would be preserved.

18:50.336 --> 18:53.160
Really? That is so not cool.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.720
I thought you were the coolest
Wonderbolt ever until now.

18:57.104 --> 18:59.616
I did what I had to do
to protect my record.

18:59.904 --> 19:02.272
Sometimes, you gotta play
dirty to be the best.

19:02.592 --> 19:04.752
That's not what being a
Wonderbolt is all about.

19:05.088 --> 19:06.048
She's right!

19:06.512 --> 19:08.240
Wonderbolts look
out for each other.

19:08.672 --> 19:11.360
Which reminds me,
where is Spitfire?

19:11.680 --> 19:14.176
I sent her the letter
pretending to be Stormy Flare.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.944
I told her I had Pegasitus
and the only cure

19:16.944 --> 19:19.360
is the Ice Iris in
the Crystal Mountains.

19:19.632 --> 19:21.664
No wonder she's
been gone so long.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.848
Ice Irises are almost
impossible to find in spring!

19:25.180 --> 19:28.096
The Crystal Mountains are too
far for anypony to make it there

19:28.096 --> 19:29.968
and back before the
Royal Garden opening.

19:30.448 --> 19:33.830
Rainbow Dash, we need you
to fly in Spitfire's place.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.632
But Spitfire shouldn't have to
miss this. I'm gonna get her.

19:37.936 --> 19:39.360
Well, you'll never
make it in time!

19:40.160 --> 19:41.936
Then there's no time to lose!

19:46.736 --> 19:48.576
Rainbow Dash is still gone!

19:48.736 --> 19:49.472
Oh, don't panic.

19:49.776 --> 19:52.368
If I know Rainbow Dash,
she'll come through.

19:57.536 --> 20:00.496
Spitfire, you're back! I
can't believe you made it!

20:00.784 --> 20:04.272
Oh, I wouldn't have, if Rainbow
hadn't found me so fast.

20:04.688 --> 20:06.336
Gave me enough time to fly back!

20:07.024 --> 20:09.168
Rare, I couldn't have
done it without you.

20:09.392 --> 20:11.168
And I'm sorry
I doubted you.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.600
But why didn't you tell
me what you were doing?

20:13.872 --> 20:16.032
Well, I didn't want to get your
hopes up until I was sure.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.864
And I couldn't be sure until
I saw that chocolate stain.

20:19.264 --> 20:20.610
Thank you for believing in me...

20:21.104 --> 20:24.704
...even when I was doubting
you. I'm some friend, huh?

20:25.184 --> 20:26.880
Actually, you're
quite a good friend.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.224
You went to get Spitfire,

20:28.352 --> 20:30.320
even though it meant
you couldn't fly today.

20:31.568 --> 20:33.340
I'll get
my chance one day.

20:33.648 --> 20:37.536
Or today. How'd you like Wind
Rider's spot in the show?

20:39.008 --> 20:41.300
What? You can't
do this to me.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.288
I'm one of the greatest
Wonderbolts there ever was!

20:44.704 --> 20:47.856
Not anymore. For attempting
to frame Rainbow Dash,

20:48.048 --> 20:51.152
I hereby strip you of
your Wonderbolt status!

20:53.792 --> 20:56.208
So would you like
to fly with us?

20:56.864 --> 21:00.390
Would I? Woo-hoo!
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

21:00.390 --> 21:03.328
Uh-huh, Uh-huh!
Yeah! Oh, YEAH!

21:03.328 --> 21:04.940
Uh, Rainbow Dash?

21:07.120 --> 21:08.224
Coming!

21:13.136 --> 21:15.280
<i>So my friend got</i>
<i> her moment in the sun.</i>

21:15.712 --> 21:18.256
<i> Or the center of an aerial</i>
<i> flower as the case may be.</i>

21:19.280 --> 21:21.952
<i> And as for me? I got a</i>
<i> chance to show off my</i>

21:21.952 --> 21:23.696
<i>Femme Mystique Chic collection!</i>

21:24.000 --> 21:25.136
That's nice, dear.

21:26.048 --> 21:27.904
Oh. Did I say
that out loud?
