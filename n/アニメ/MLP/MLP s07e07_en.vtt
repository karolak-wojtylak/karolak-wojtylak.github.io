WEBVTT

00:04.638 --> 00:09.508
Scootaloo, is this
such a... good idea?

00:09.610 --> 00:11.143
What are you talking about?

00:11.345 --> 00:13.312
This is the best
idea I've ever had!

00:15.014 --> 00:16.248
It's just--

00:16.350 --> 00:19.051
--You wanna come. But
we talked about this.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.653
Non-Pegasus ponies fall
through the clouds.

00:24.124 --> 00:25.124
Right, but--

00:26.126 --> 00:26.993
I think we're good.

00:28.295 --> 00:29.195
We are?

00:30.097 --> 00:32.431
Scootaloo, I know you
have to go to Cloudsdale

00:32.533 --> 00:34.600
to finish your report;
I'm just wondering

00:34.702 --> 00:36.902
if this is the best
way to get there.

00:37.304 --> 00:40.606
It'll be fine. Besides,
how else could I get there?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.241
A Pegasus chariot.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.509
A flock of birds!

00:43.611 --> 00:45.044
A hot air balloon.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.813
Huh, those do seem a lot safer.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.781
Maybe I should try
to find another--

00:49.883 --> 00:52.449
--WAAAAYY!

00:54.555 --> 00:55.554
WOOHOO!

01:00.894 --> 01:02.294
Nailed it.

01:05.365 --> 01:07.299
Little ma'am, are
you all right?

01:13.607 --> 01:19.411
You're-- you're-- you're
Rainbow Dash's dad!

01:21.181 --> 01:23.916
Ah yes. Bow Hothoof
at your service.

02:11.665 --> 02:14.900
Uh, honey, something's
going on out here!

02:21.776 --> 02:25.211
Oh, heavens to Celestia,
what's wrong with her?!

02:25.813 --> 02:29.016
I don't know, but you
just made it worse.

02:30.518 --> 02:35.387
Sorry, it's just, you're
RAINBOW DASH'S PARENTS!

02:38.459 --> 02:39.958
She's doing it again!

02:41.829 --> 02:43.227
Oh, dearie, please.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.932
You might shatter my Princess
Celestia commemorative plates!

02:47.134 --> 02:47.766
Agh!

02:52.138 --> 02:55.908
I'm so sorry. I just... I
can't believe I'm meeting you.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.076
My name's Scootaloo and
I'm doing a school report

02:58.178 --> 02:59.244
on your daughter.

03:00.313 --> 03:01.947
Our Rainbow Dash?

03:02.449 --> 03:04.783
The report's on an
inspirational pony in my life.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.352
And no pony inspires
me more than she does!

03:09.589 --> 03:11.690
I'm putting together this
scrapbook for my report.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.859
I'm her biggest fan!

03:14.461 --> 03:17.796
Little trotter, what
you say is impossible...

03:17.898 --> 03:23.168
because nopony is a bigger fan
of our Rainbow Dash THAN US!

03:25.238 --> 03:29.275
Whoa. You always
wear that shirt?

03:29.777 --> 03:33.745
Actually it's er.. laundry day,
but pretty great, right?

03:34.047 --> 03:34.680
Yeah!

03:35.382 --> 03:38.350
My name's Windy Whistles
and I just have to say

03:38.352 --> 03:40.719
that it is a total
blast to meet somepony

03:40.721 --> 03:43.889
that loves Rainbow
Dash as much as we do!

03:43.991 --> 03:45.389
What can we help
you with?

03:45.591 --> 03:48.493
Well, I know all about Rainbow
Dash's time in Ponyville,

03:48.495 --> 03:50.863
but I don't know anything
about her life before that.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.999
Well, you came to
the right place.

03:59.339 --> 04:02.408
Windy: Here you go. Rainbow
Dash's favorite meal.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.245
A pasta and potato
sandwich on sourdough!

04:06.547 --> 04:08.114
She just LOVES to carbo load!

04:09.016 --> 04:12.351
I can't believe I'm eating
Rainbow Dash's favorite food,

04:12.553 --> 04:14.720
made by Rainbow Dash's mom,

04:14.822 --> 04:18.023
while sitting in Rainbow
Dash's childhood kitchen!!

04:18.325 --> 04:21.894
This is the greatest
day of my life!

04:25.199 --> 04:27.399
Mm! Mmmmm!

04:27.801 --> 04:30.836
I think it's time for
a tour of the house.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.171
OK!

04:32.873 --> 04:36.875
Our little Dashie was an early
learner and so rambunctious.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.211
The combination was...

04:40.280 --> 04:41.413
EXCITING!

04:44.250 --> 04:46.285
Woah.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.358
Is that her room?

04:59.098 --> 05:01.000
Rainbow Dash's linen closet!

05:01.702 --> 05:03.102
Her carpet!

05:03.504 --> 05:05.638
Her inspirational poster!

05:06.440 --> 05:09.474
"When the going gets tough,
the tough don't notice

05:09.576 --> 05:13.478
because they have hard shells."
That's so Rainbow Dash.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.318
Woohoo!

05:19.720 --> 05:22.721
Scootaloo, want to see
something really cool?

05:41.474 --> 05:44.343
I.. uhh.. installed the
sound effects myself.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.147
Pretty great, huh?

05:48.449 --> 05:49.615
So great!

05:49.717 --> 05:51.016
And look at this.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.787
She was wearing it when
she spoke her first words.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.422
So cool!

05:59.926 --> 06:03.562
And this broken lantern is from
when she first learned to fly.

06:05.665 --> 06:09.569
And this bitten apple is from
when she grew her first tooth.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.003
So many memories...

06:13.139 --> 06:16.041
You're so lucky to
have all of these.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.877
Well, I may have a
ton of Dash-mentos,

06:19.079 --> 06:20.779
but I don't have
any of those

06:20.881 --> 06:24.416
Rainbow Dash saves Ponyville
headlines like you.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.168
Tradesies?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.285
Dealsies!

06:31.457 --> 06:33.759
So where's all the
Wonderbolt stuff?

06:34.561 --> 06:37.796
You mean.. Rainbow Dash's
personal collection

06:37.798 --> 06:39.499
of Wonderbolt memorabilia?

06:40.501 --> 06:43.001
No, I mean where's all the
stuff about Rainbow Dash

06:43.103 --> 06:45.270
getting accepted into
the Wonderbolt Academy

06:45.472 --> 06:47.572
and then getting
chosen as a Wonderbolt.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.744
Wait, you don't know that
your daughter's a Wonderbolt?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.147
And I got to tell you!

06:57.984 --> 07:01.119
Oh, wow, you should see
your faces right now!

07:04.090 --> 07:05.457
See that's what your
faces look like.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.566
Our daughter's a WONDERBOLT?!

07:17.704 --> 07:18.637
Great timing.

07:18.939 --> 07:19.871
Great door.

07:19.873 --> 07:23.709
I just... it's unbelievable!

07:24.111 --> 07:27.279
You two were kind enough to show
me the Rainbow Dash you know;

07:27.581 --> 07:31.350
now please, allow me to show
you the Rainbow Dash I know.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.961
Let's make some thunder!

07:43.130 --> 07:45.096
I was born to
make thunder!

07:49.669 --> 07:51.036
We've got turbulence!

07:51.038 --> 07:53.071
How? Where's it
coming from?

07:54.408 --> 07:55.306
There!

08:00.580 --> 08:01.480
Oh, no.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.849
OK, which pony
broke protocol

08:05.886 --> 08:08.620
and invited guests to
our training exercises?

08:09.122 --> 08:10.822
I guess they're
with me.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.324
Agh!

08:14.094 --> 08:18.764
Mom, Dad,
so ..good to see you.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.101
Oh, honey it's so
great to see you, too!

08:22.903 --> 08:25.570
And WOW! You were so
amazing up there

08:25.572 --> 08:27.372
with all of that flying!

08:27.574 --> 08:29.708
Er.. How did you know
I was here?

08:29.910 --> 08:32.844
Scootaloo filled us
in on everything.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.013
You modest pony, you.

08:37.617 --> 08:40.185
I can't believe I'm
documenting the moment

08:40.187 --> 08:42.854
your parents first saw
you as a Wonderbolt!

08:45.057 --> 08:47.827
And these must be your
Wonderbolt friends.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.364
Hello team! I'm Windy Whistles,

08:52.766 --> 08:56.802
the mom of the best
Wonderbolt ever! Yeah!

08:57.404 --> 09:00.639
Just kidding.. you guys
were great, too. Go team!

09:01.041 --> 09:02.540
Mom....

09:03.844 --> 09:06.311
Hello Ma'am, nice
to meet you.

09:07.013 --> 09:11.850
Nice to meet you, as well and
love those goggles! Love 'em!

09:12.552 --> 09:14.519
You know I have
goggles, too,

09:14.821 --> 09:17.689
but they're mostly just for
swimming. Oh and bath time.

09:19.158 --> 09:23.428
Mom, please! They don't want
to hear about your bath time.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.166
I can't believe it. My
daughter, a Wonderbolt!

09:28.168 --> 09:29.401
So proud!

09:29.903 --> 09:33.038
Dad, hold it together!
We're in public.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.540
I know, I know, but it's just...

09:35.642 --> 09:38.510
you had a goal and
...you achieved it!

09:44.917 --> 09:47.067
All right Wonderbolts,
let's hit the showers

09:47.254 --> 09:50.656
and give Rainbow Dash some
time to spend with her family.

09:51.658 --> 09:54.025
OK, yeah. Great practice.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.696
I'll uh, catch up with
you guys in a minute.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.866
Sir. You really
raised a great flyer.

10:01.368 --> 10:05.536
Oh, no... tears
welling up again!

10:05.638 --> 10:06.738
Dad.....

10:13.146 --> 10:14.546
Could you give us a sec?

10:15.781 --> 10:17.149
Is something wrong?

10:17.551 --> 10:19.084
Yeah, you should
have warned me

10:19.186 --> 10:20.784
that you were
bringing my parents,

10:20.886 --> 10:23.555
or talked to Twilight or
something. Not just shown up!

10:24.257 --> 10:25.055
Why?

10:25.757 --> 10:28.927
It's just, my parents and I
have a delicate relationship.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.196
I love them very much
and we're really close,

10:31.298 --> 10:34.032
but there's a reason I didn't
tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!

10:34.434 --> 10:37.002
They can be a little
bit... embarrassing.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.205
Huh...? Really?

10:40.707 --> 10:42.074
Yeah, really.

10:42.376 --> 10:45.778
And now you've invited a whole
lot of crazy into my life!

10:47.080 --> 10:48.713
What's wrong with
a little support?

10:53.887 --> 10:56.054
Bow and Windy, I'd
like you to meet

10:56.056 --> 10:57.522
Apple Bloom and
Sweetie Belle.

10:57.724 --> 10:58.374
Hi!

10:58.391 --> 10:59.090
Hello!

10:59.492 --> 11:00.792
Greetings, small ponies.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.194
Are you excited to
see Rainbow Dash?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.264
Oh, my, YES!

11:05.666 --> 11:09.100
And to think we never bothered
to come to a Wonderbolt event!

11:09.302 --> 11:11.303
We said if Rainbow Dash
isn't a Wonderbolt,

11:11.405 --> 11:14.273
then what's the
point? But now she is!

11:14.775 --> 11:16.241
And she earned it!

11:17.843 --> 11:20.211
Did you know it all
started when she won a spot

11:20.313 --> 11:22.647
in the coveted
Wonderbolt Academy,

11:22.749 --> 11:24.683
training under Spitfire!

11:25.085 --> 11:28.753
I didn't know that!
How wonderful!

11:29.155 --> 11:31.790
But then she had some
heavy competition,

11:31.992 --> 11:35.860
especially against another
Pegasus named Lightning Dust.

11:36.162 --> 11:37.796
Oh, no...

11:37.998 --> 11:40.632
But of course, Rainbow
Dash proved to be the best

11:40.834 --> 11:43.568
and later made it into
the Wonderbolt Reserves!

11:44.170 --> 11:45.637
Hooray again!

11:45.939 --> 11:49.941
But.. a jealous ex-Wonderbolt,
Wind Rider, was worried

11:50.043 --> 11:52.877
that Rainbow Dash might
break his speed record

11:52.979 --> 11:57.048
and so he framed her for
a crime she didn't commit.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.200
Oh, no!

11:59.753 --> 12:02.754
But thanks to Rarity, Rainbow
Dash proved her innocence

12:02.756 --> 12:04.723
and became a back-up Wonderbolt.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.825
Until Fire Streak retired

12:06.927 --> 12:09.294
and she became an
official Wonderbolt!

12:09.796 --> 12:11.062
Hooray!

12:11.564 --> 12:14.299
Wow! What a gripping tale.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.851
You really know your
Rainbow Dash history.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.203
You're going to do
great on your report.

12:20.706 --> 12:21.806
Show's about to start!

12:29.616 --> 12:31.349
HOO! HOO! HOO! HOO! HOO!

12:31.551 --> 12:35.053
Come on, bolts, LET'S
START THIS THING!

12:35.155 --> 12:40.158
Wonderbolts Spring
Showcase HERE. WE. GOOOO!

12:40.660 --> 12:43.828
Rip it up and tear! it! down!

12:44.030 --> 12:47.766
Then build it back up again
and tear it back down again!

12:47.968 --> 12:49.000
Yeah! Woo!

12:49.302 --> 12:51.970
Yeah! Uhuh! Uhuh!

12:52.472 --> 12:54.606
Go go go! Yes!

12:56.742 --> 13:00.845
GO RAINBOW DASH!
BEST WONDERBOLT EVER!

13:01.147 --> 13:03.582
Woohoo! That's my daughter!

13:03.984 --> 13:06.651
Go Rainbow! Go Dashie!
Go go go go go!

13:10.824 --> 13:14.492
Woohoo! You go, girl!

13:17.229 --> 13:18.997
Your folks were
definitely loud,

13:19.099 --> 13:20.619
but they weren't that bad.

13:23.836 --> 13:26.938
Whoa, since when did we
add fireworks to the show?

13:27.040 --> 13:29.208
Uh...we didn't.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.945
Atta girl! Woohoo!
Yeah! Go girl! Go go go go!

13:39.519 --> 13:40.385
Wow.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.460
Go RAINBOW DASH!

13:51.497 --> 13:53.498
You sign that photo!

13:53.900 --> 13:54.633
Whoo!

14:00.140 --> 14:03.473
Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon!
Cut the ribbon!

14:07.513 --> 14:09.981
The camera loves
you! Yeah!

14:10.583 --> 14:12.384
Now let's do the pyramid.

14:13.586 --> 14:16.087
Scootaloo get up
there; you're the top!

14:16.589 --> 14:21.159
You really do got yourself your
very own mega fans! Lucky you.

14:33.072 --> 14:34.340
You hung that towel!

14:34.942 --> 14:35.641
YEAH!

14:36.042 --> 14:38.576
Greatest towel
hanger OF ALL TIME!

14:38.778 --> 14:45.650
TOWEL! TOWEL!
TOWEL! TOWEL!

14:46.152 --> 14:47.050
STOP!

14:47.352 --> 14:51.923
This is ridiculous! Mom and Dad,
you are both too supportive!

14:52.425 --> 14:54.926
This is exactly why I didn't
tell you I was a Wonderbolt;

14:55.428 --> 14:57.295
you're just.. too much!

14:57.697 --> 14:59.764
Did.. did we do something wrong?

15:00.666 --> 15:02.767
Yes! The fireworks,
the cheerleading

15:02.869 --> 15:05.870
and how do you even compare
who is better or worse

15:05.972 --> 15:07.839
at hanging up a towel?!

15:08.974 --> 15:11.209
We're just trying
to be supportive.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.896
Well, I'm tired of it! I've
had enough of you two

15:13.980 --> 15:16.120
being so proud of every
little ridiculous,

15:16.216 --> 15:18.183
insignificant thing I do!

15:21.754 --> 15:23.755
I think you should leave.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.926
First of all, great job
yelling at us, sweetie.

15:28.128 --> 15:33.164
No one can make their parents
feel more worthless than you.

15:33.466 --> 15:38.370
Your words were direct,
clear and... so painful.

15:38.672 --> 15:41.372
Is there nothing
you can't do!?

15:44.010 --> 15:44.810
Why?

15:45.412 --> 15:47.879
Scootaloo, you
don't understand.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.149
I met your parents hoping
to learn more about you

15:51.751 --> 15:53.451
but I don't like
what I found out.

15:55.321 --> 15:58.723
I'll find somepony else
to do my hero report on.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.537
Scootaloo, wait!

16:12.339 --> 16:14.005
I know I wasn't
myself back there

16:14.207 --> 16:15.841
and I shouldn't have
snapped at my parents.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.544
But that's exactly why I didn't
tell them I'm a Wonderbolt.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.448
I don't understand;
they're so proud of you.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.518
Can I tell you something?

16:27.320 --> 16:27.818
Sure.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.388
OK, but you might want
to hold onto your wings

16:30.490 --> 16:33.425
because this could rock
you to your very core.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.680
Believe it or not,
there was a time

16:39.733 --> 16:42.333
when I wasn't the
best at everything.

16:44.571 --> 16:48.239
See this picture? It looks
like I won something awesome.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.042
But, actually...

16:50.644 --> 16:53.111
Announcer: And last but not
least, it's time to hand out

16:53.213 --> 16:54.813
our participant stickers.

16:59.085 --> 17:05.924
Yeah! Rainbow Dash,
you show them!

17:06.525 --> 17:08.961
Greatest participant ever!

17:09.263 --> 17:12.497
Uh... your parents realize you
didn't win, don't they?

17:15.401 --> 17:18.169
Granted, I was the youngest pony

17:18.271 --> 17:20.138
in the senior
competitive circuit.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.806
Most other ponies my age

17:21.808 --> 17:24.142
were still in the
junior flappers club.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.245
I thought it was
utterly mortifying

17:27.347 --> 17:30.015
having my parents cheer
me on even when I lost.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.218
But then when I started
to win competitions,

17:33.420 --> 17:35.487
which didn't take
very long, by the way,

17:35.789 --> 17:37.923
things got even worse.

17:38.625 --> 17:42.593
Woo!! Yeah! Go Rainbow!
Go Rainbow! Woohoo!

17:42.695 --> 17:45.463
Yeah, Rainbow Dash! You
show em! That's our girl!

17:45.565 --> 17:47.532
Being the best came
with consequences.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.102
Very loud, very
embarrassing consequences.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.973
You know, some
ponies would dream

17:56.075 --> 17:57.575
of having parents
like that.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.379
Yeah, right, name one.

18:01.081 --> 18:06.184
Me. Growing up, I never thought
I'd be the best at anything

18:06.286 --> 18:08.287
because no pony ever told me.

18:08.789 --> 18:12.257
But your parents told you
over and over again -- look.

18:12.859 --> 18:17.462
Best bath taker ever. Best
carrot eater under three.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.532
Greatest napper of all time!

18:21.434 --> 18:25.036
I am pretty good at napping.
I can fall asleep anywhere.

18:28.975 --> 18:29.574
Huh?

18:30.976 --> 18:33.411
For your entire life,
your parents gave you

18:33.513 --> 18:35.446
the confidence to
believe in yourself.

18:39.551 --> 18:43.688
You're right. I was always
so embarrassed by my parents

18:43.890 --> 18:46.657
that I didn't realize their
support actually made me

18:46.759 --> 18:49.727
the awesome, confident,
amazing, awesome

18:49.829 --> 18:51.762
and awesome pony I am!

18:55.033 --> 18:57.069
And I took them for granted!

18:57.871 --> 18:59.537
And you yelled
at them.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.206
Ugh, I gotta make
this right.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.745
I have an idea, but I'm
going to need your help!

19:07.347 --> 19:10.348
That is, if you're willing to
help me after I acted like that.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.552
Now that's a great picture.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.322
Rainbow Dash learns
the error of her ways.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.794
I'm telling you, I just
can't see a thing!

19:23.196 --> 19:25.930
Scootaloo, you are just
so great at blindfolds.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.034
It's true. You must tell me
what kind of knot you used.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.237
A Falconer's knot? Wait
no... a farmer's loop!

19:32.939 --> 19:34.773
What's this
all about, anyhoo?

19:35.475 --> 19:37.876
Rainbow over loudspeaker: Windy
Whistles and Bow Hothoof,

19:38.678 --> 19:42.547
please be seated for a super
private Wonderbolt event.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.458
Ahem.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.460
Mom and Dad, welcome to the...

19:55.962 --> 19:57.660
"I love my parents and
I'm sorry that I took them

19:57.762 --> 19:59.864
for granted and I know that
they made me who I am today

19:59.966 --> 20:01.899
so I really want to make
it up to them" event.

20:05.103 --> 20:05.870
Enjoy.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.143
Thanks for doing this.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.411
Happy to help!

20:18.885 --> 20:21.753
Ooooh! Aaaaah!

20:25.001 --> 20:26.101
Oooooh!

20:35.621 --> 20:36.221
Oooooh!

20:38.704 --> 20:42.807
Mom and Dad, I want you to know
that I'm your biggest fan.

20:45.778 --> 20:49.981
Oh, honey, thank you. But you
didn't have to do all this.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.151
It's kind of... embarrassing.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.520
Yeah, it is a bit much.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.290
And that's why Rainbow Dash

20:59.392 --> 21:02.293
is the most inspirational
pony in my life.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.632
Thank you, Scootaloo.
Very well researched,

21:07.834 --> 21:09.734
but a little heavy
on the pictures

21:09.836 --> 21:12.471
and there was a moldy
sandwich in your report.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.405
I'll give you a B.

21:14.807 --> 21:18.677
YEAH! GREATEST
REPORT-GIVER OF ALL TIME!

21:19.279 --> 21:24.415
SCOOT-AL-LOO! SCOOT-AL-LOO!
SCOOT-AL-LOO!

21:24.517 --> 21:27.919
Keep it down! OK, this isn't
a rock and roll concert!

21:28.721 --> 21:29.721
Please!

21:29.845 --> 21:32.045
SCOOT-AL-LOO! SCOOT-AL-LOO!
SCOOT-AL-LOO!
