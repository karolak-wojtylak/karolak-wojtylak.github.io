00:08.650 --> 00:11.424
I just don't feel like
it's quite finished.

00:11.525 --> 00:12.686
I know what you mean.

00:12.687 --> 00:15.466
It's for Miss Cheerilee,
it needs to be perfect.

00:15.467 --> 00:18.106
Hearts and Hooves Day
only comes once a year.

00:18.450 --> 00:20.402
I say we add a little more ribbon!

00:21.089 --> 00:21.680
Yeah.

00:21.681 --> 00:24.431
And just a tiny bit more lace.

00:26.306 --> 00:27.997
A few more hoof-prints.

00:29.476 --> 00:30.150
Glitter!

00:30.151 --> 00:32.905
It could definitely use
just a little more glitter.

00:36.654 --> 00:40.215
Now that'll show Miss Cheerilee
how much we care about her.

00:40.216 --> 00:43.456
Just have to get it to the
Hearts and Hooves party at school.

00:44.838 --> 00:47.665
I think we're gonna need
a bigger envelope...

00:50.714 --> 00:55.714

01:30.536 --> 01:32.956
It's lovely.
And so...

01:34.657 --> 01:35.500
...big!

01:35.501 --> 01:38.447
We just wanted to let you know that
we think you're the best teacher

01:38.448 --> 01:39.484
in the whole wide world!

01:39.485 --> 01:43.100
And we think you're super!
And that we love you so so much!

01:43.150 --> 01:45.768
And we want you to have
the best Hearts and Hooves Day...

01:45.769 --> 01:46.830
...ever!

01:46.930 --> 01:48.423
Thank you so much, girls.

01:48.424 --> 01:49.824
I love it, I really do.

01:49.825 --> 01:53.638
I'm sure it's nothing compared to
the gifts you've gotten from your...

01:53.639 --> 01:56.066
...very special somepony!

01:56.267 --> 01:58.983
I don't have a very special somepony
at the moment.

02:00.629 --> 02:01.434
Really?

02:01.635 --> 02:05.079
How could somepony as amazing as you
not have a very special somepony

02:05.080 --> 02:06.780
in Hearts and Hooves Day?

02:07.697 --> 02:09.294
It's alright, Sweetie Belle.

02:09.295 --> 02:12.018
I have lots of good friends
and wonderful students

02:12.019 --> 02:13.790
who care about me very much.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.859
I'm gonna have an absolutely terrific
Hearts and Hooves Day!

02:17.860 --> 02:18.900
Alright everypony,

02:19.000 --> 02:22.235
who's ready to play
"pin the heart on the pony"?

02:26.069 --> 02:28.869
If anypony deserves
a very special somepony,

02:28.870 --> 02:30.196
it's her!

02:32.134 --> 02:33.000
You alright?

02:33.100 --> 02:34.481
I'm more than alright,

02:34.482 --> 02:37.364
I've just come up
with the best idea ever!

02:37.565 --> 02:40.840
We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee
a very special somepony...

02:41.443 --> 02:45.477
- That is the best idea ever.
- Told you!

02:45.678 --> 02:47.275
So, what are we waiting for?

02:47.276 --> 02:49.679
Hearts and Hooves Day
is almost over!

02:50.000 --> 02:54.079
Let's get out there and find
somepony special for Cheerilee already.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.273
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

02:59.550 --> 03:01.922
Now it can't be just any pony.

03:01.923 --> 03:04.876
Miss Cheerilee is one of
the best mares in Ponyville.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.720
She deserves to have
one of the best stallions

03:07.721 --> 03:09.714
as her very special somepony.

03:13.550 --> 03:16.852
<i>Cheerilee is sweet and kind</i>

03:16.853 --> 03:20.695
<i>She's the best teacher we could hope for</i>

03:20.696 --> 03:24.850
<i>The perfect stallion you and I must find</i>

03:25.151 --> 03:30.650
<i>One to really make her heart soar</i>

03:31.051 --> 03:32.403
<i>But...</i>

03:32.404 --> 03:33.604
<i>This one's too young</i>

03:33.605 --> 03:35.810
<i>This one's too old</i>

03:36.111 --> 03:39.747
<i>He clearly has a terrible cold</i>

03:40.048 --> 03:41.533
<i>This guy's too silly</i>

03:41.534 --> 03:43.200
<i>He's way too uptight</i>

03:43.201 --> 03:44.234
I say!

03:44.335 --> 03:46.350
<i>Well, nothing's wrong with this one</i>

03:46.350 --> 03:49.131
<i>He seems alright</i>

03:49.132 --> 03:51.074
<i>His girlfriend sure thinks so...</i>

03:51.075 --> 03:52.000
<i>How 'bout this one?</i>

03:52.000 --> 03:54.231
<i>He's much too flashy</i>

03:54.732 --> 03:55.840
<i>He might do</i>

03:55.841 --> 03:58.295
<i>If he weren't so splashy</i>

03:58.900 --> 03:59.853
<i>Too short</i>

03:59.854 --> 04:00.854
<i>Too tall</i>

04:00.855 --> 04:01.655
<i>Too clean</i>

04:01.656 --> 04:02.656
<i>Too smelly</i>

04:02.657 --> 04:08.400
<i>He's strangely obsessed
with types of jelly</i>

04:09.762 --> 04:12.873
<i>I don't think that we're mistaken</i>

04:12.874 --> 04:17.120
<i>It seems all the good ones are taken</i>

04:17.321 --> 04:19.300
<i>I really feel that at this rate</i>

04:19.300 --> 04:21.212
<i>We'll never find the perfect date</i>

04:21.213 --> 04:23.268
<i>Don't wanna quit and give up hope</i>

04:23.469 --> 04:26.141
Doing anything special
for Hearts and Hooves Day?

04:26.142 --> 04:28.080
<i>Oh please oh please oh please say...</i>

04:28.081 --> 04:29.181
Nope.

04:29.950 --> 04:33.037
<i>We did it girls, we've found the one</i>

04:33.538 --> 04:37.379
<i>Who will send our teacher's heart aflutter</i>

04:37.680 --> 04:39.500
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.256
Are you talkin' about my brother?

04:49.250 --> 04:50.701
Sweetie Belle is right.

04:50.702 --> 04:53.594
Big Macintosh is the perfect match
for Miss Cheerilee.

04:53.695 --> 04:57.450
He's really nice, super hard-working...

04:58.500 --> 05:00.275
But he's also pretty shy!

05:00.390 --> 05:04.618
He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee
to be his very special somepony.

05:04.619 --> 05:06.449
Maybe he doesn't have to.

05:07.420 --> 05:12.062
If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee
in a really romantic setting,

05:12.063 --> 05:14.260
I bet she'll ask him!

05:14.461 --> 05:16.030
Sounds like a plan to me.

05:16.130 --> 05:18.591
So? What are we waiting for?

05:18.592 --> 05:21.767
Let's get out there
and create the perfect date.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.378
Flowers.
Don't forget the flowers.

05:32.379 --> 05:34.086
Oops.
I'm on it!

05:37.314 --> 05:38.435
They're coming!

05:38.536 --> 05:40.402
This is gonna be perfect.

05:40.510 --> 05:43.743
Miss Cheerilee is gonna have
the best Hearts and Hooves Day ever.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.744
With her new very special somepony.

05:49.930 --> 05:50.850
Hi, girls!

05:51.051 --> 05:52.611
Hi, Miss Cheerilee!

05:52.612 --> 05:55.840
So, you three said you needed
help identifying a tree

05:55.840 --> 05:57.456
you found here near the gazebo?

06:01.621 --> 06:02.930
That's an apple tree.

06:03.131 --> 06:04.100
Is it?

06:10.694 --> 06:12.150
Sorry, big brother.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.113
We went and fixed up
the gazebo all on our own.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.651
See?

06:16.652 --> 06:19.597
As long as you're here,
why not have a bite to eat

06:19.598 --> 06:22.595
from this romantic-looking picnic?

06:22.596 --> 06:25.692
Oh gosh, seems like
there's only room for two!

06:25.693 --> 06:28.284
I guess we'll just be going, then.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.528
You really think this'll work?

06:35.529 --> 06:38.800
Of course it will work,
they're perfect for each other.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.949
Beautiful day we're having.

06:47.862 --> 06:48.780
Eeyup.

06:49.481 --> 06:51.885
Any big plans for tonight?

06:52.486 --> 06:53.655
Nope.

06:57.385 --> 06:59.483
Oh, come on Miss Cheerilee!

06:59.484 --> 07:02.124
Ask him to be your
very special somepony.

07:02.831 --> 07:04.200
Oh my gosh, look.

07:11.984 --> 07:13.260
Big Mac...

07:13.261 --> 07:14.361
Eeyup?

07:16.347 --> 07:18.385
You have something
stuck in your teeth.

07:19.050 --> 07:20.877
OH, COME ON!

07:22.554 --> 07:25.488
Well, this has been... strange.

07:25.789 --> 07:26.886
Eeyup.

07:27.700 --> 07:29.060
I need to get going.

07:29.061 --> 07:31.530
But it's always great running
into a good friend.

07:31.530 --> 07:32.547
Eeyup.

07:39.243 --> 07:42.338
Do you think it just wasn't
romantic enough?

07:42.339 --> 07:44.604
Maybe it was too romantic.

07:45.405 --> 07:47.330
Either way, we failed.

07:48.650 --> 07:51.006
There's gotta be something else we could...

07:52.350 --> 07:54.500
Oh my goodness,
I didn't even see you there.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.350
I'm so so sorry.

07:56.351 --> 07:59.567
It's okay Twilight,
it was an accident.

07:59.773 --> 08:02.230
I've just been reading the most
fascinating book about

08:02.231 --> 08:03.587
Hearts and Hooves Day.

08:03.588 --> 08:05.580
Did you know that
this holiday got its start

08:05.580 --> 08:07.325
because of a love potion?

08:10.339 --> 08:13.189
Did you say... a love potion?

08:13.190 --> 08:15.460
That's right.
It even has the recipe.

08:15.761 --> 08:21.155
I don't suppose we could borrow
that book for a little while, do ya?

08:21.356 --> 08:22.890
Of course you can.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.484
I have another book here,
that I think you'll...

08:34.333 --> 08:35.901
Take a tuft of cloud.

08:40.143 --> 08:41.719
A bright rainbow's glow.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.897
Stir with a Pegasus feather.

08:51.047 --> 08:52.740
Fast, not slow.

08:54.518 --> 08:57.736
Serve to ponies
who aren't in the know.

09:01.581 --> 09:05.511
I feel kinda bad tricking my brother
and Miss Cheerilee this way...

09:05.700 --> 09:06.812
What's the problem?

09:06.813 --> 09:09.594
We all agreed these two
are perfect for one another.

09:09.595 --> 09:12.246
Yeah, they just need a little nudge.

09:12.447 --> 09:15.720
And what can make them happier
than being together, right?

09:16.321 --> 09:17.524
Right!

09:19.144 --> 09:20.107
Here they come!

09:21.002 --> 09:22.869
Hi, Miss Cheerilee.

09:22.870 --> 09:24.170
Hello again, girls.

09:24.171 --> 09:25.371
Hello, Big Mac.

09:26.331 --> 09:29.333
Would you three like to tell us
why it was so very important

09:29.368 --> 09:31.000
- ...that we meet you here?
- Punch!

09:31.900 --> 09:33.000
Excuse me?

09:33.100 --> 09:34.752
Punch!
We made punch.

09:34.753 --> 09:37.747
We were gonna set up a stand
and try to sell it, but,

09:37.748 --> 09:40.701
we needed some pony
to taste test it first.

09:40.702 --> 09:41.802
Yup.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.901
We thought you two
would be perfect together...

09:44.902 --> 09:46.774
To test it...

09:46.775 --> 09:48.150
...together.

09:50.162 --> 09:52.873
So, we'll just leave you two alone...

09:54.361 --> 09:56.110
Together, to test it.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.962
I'm very sorry about this.

10:01.963 --> 10:05.358
I mentioned to the girls that
I don't have a very special somepony.

10:05.359 --> 10:08.167
And I believe they're putting us
in these awkward situations

10:08.168 --> 10:11.029
because they've decided it should be you.

10:15.574 --> 10:18.354
I suppose we should just
humor them for a moment.

10:18.355 --> 10:20.440
This punch does look delicious.

10:20.441 --> 10:21.449
Eeyup.

10:23.009 --> 10:24.772
I think they're gonna drink it!

10:24.773 --> 10:26.173
To good friends!

10:28.272 --> 10:30.900
They're drinking it.
They're drinking it!

10:37.550 --> 10:39.852
They're looking into each others' eyes.

10:40.913 --> 10:44.614
They're about to be in
for a big surprise!

10:51.169 --> 10:52.945
- Big Mac?
- Yup?

10:54.643 --> 10:57.620
Will you be my very special somepony?

10:57.599 --> 10:58.452
Eeyup.

10:58.627 --> 10:59.276
YES!

11:02.666 --> 11:07.160
He's her special somepony.
She's his special somepony.

11:07.161 --> 11:09.942
He's my special somepony.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.917
Eeeeeya.

11:15.580 --> 11:19.033
He's my shmoopy-doopy
sweedy-weedy pony pie.

11:21.405 --> 11:25.098
You're my shmoopy-doopy
sweedy-weedy pony pie.

11:25.764 --> 11:27.649
Did he just say...

11:31.797 --> 11:35.920
You're my cutie-patootie
lovie-dovie honey-bunny.

11:35.921 --> 11:40.506
You're my heartie-smartie
smirchy-wirchy baby-waby.

11:40.507 --> 11:43.811
Big Mac!
Hey! Hello!

11:44.112 --> 11:45.866
What's going on?

11:46.596 --> 11:48.965
Miss Cheerilee, are you alright?

11:49.073 --> 11:51.492
I have a special somepony.

11:52.077 --> 11:55.663
A kissy-wissy
snuggy-wuggy sugar bear.

11:58.511 --> 12:02.087
I think we may have given them
too big of a nudge.

12:02.088 --> 12:06.015
You're my cuddly-wuddly
boopsie-woopsie pumpkin pie.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.516
Ya think?

12:09.822 --> 12:11.583
What have we done?!

12:11.684 --> 12:14.985
My brother's acting like
a grade-A goofball!

12:14.986 --> 12:17.232
Maybe we added too much rainbow.

12:17.465 --> 12:18.865
Or maybe not enough cloud.

12:19.166 --> 12:21.591
Or maybe... Uh oh.

12:22.020 --> 12:24.075
What do you mean "uh oh"?!

12:24.076 --> 12:27.726
We might not have given Big Mac
and Miss Cheerilee a love potion...

12:27.727 --> 12:30.744
We may have given them a love poison!

12:30.894 --> 12:31.923
What?!?!

12:32.124 --> 12:35.641
Apparently, some prince who
long time ago whipped up this recipe

12:35.642 --> 12:37.612
and gave it to this princess he liked.

12:37.655 --> 12:42.789
He meant it to be a love potion,
but things didn't turn out so well.

12:42.990 --> 12:46.232
How "not so well" did things turn out?

12:46.933 --> 12:50.097
Well, there's something here
about a dragon...

12:50.098 --> 12:53.141
Kingdom falling...
Chaos reigning...

12:53.476 --> 12:56.151
Okay, apparently it was all because
the prince and princess

12:56.152 --> 12:59.361
were so lost in each others' eyes,
that they couldn't perform

12:59.362 --> 13:00.750
their royal duties.

13:02.740 --> 13:03.611
Great!

13:03.612 --> 13:05.663
We've not only turned
Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee

13:05.664 --> 13:07.957
into a couple of nonsense-spouting
nincompoops,

13:07.958 --> 13:11.235
we may have put all of
Ponyville in jeopardy!

13:14.411 --> 13:15.803
Come on, Apple Bloom.

13:15.804 --> 13:19.017
Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac
don't have any royal duties.

13:19.052 --> 13:21.808
But they still got responsibilities.

13:21.809 --> 13:26.198
If we don't fix this, Miss Cheerilee
won't be able to teach.

13:26.233 --> 13:29.304
Big Mac won't be able to
harvest any apples.

13:29.305 --> 13:31.088
And before you know it...

13:34.328 --> 13:38.542
Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated
little ponies starving for apples.

13:38.543 --> 13:41.055
It'll be chaos, it'll be chaos!

13:43.111 --> 13:44.557
There's an antidote!

13:44.558 --> 13:46.754
Well, why didn't you say so?

13:46.755 --> 13:49.619
Didn't you see me gettin'
all panicked back there?

13:49.620 --> 13:53.221
If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac
from looking into each others' eyes

13:53.222 --> 13:56.051
for one full hour,
the love curse will be broken.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.401
Only an hour?

13:57.802 --> 13:59.955
We can pull that off in a second.

14:01.705 --> 14:04.274
You take the first sip,
snuggle-wuggles.

14:04.806 --> 14:07.544
Nope, you take it, sugar lump.

14:07.545 --> 14:09.307
No, you, shnooky-lumps.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.725
No, you, pooky-pie.

14:11.012 --> 14:14.454
I'm all for romance,
but this has been going on for hours.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.669
What's happened to these two?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.138
Who knows?

14:22.357 --> 14:26.156
Well, these love birds will probably
be planning a wedding soon.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.125
I can always use the catering business.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.579
A wedding!
That's it!

14:31.580 --> 14:34.292
Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac
should get married!

14:34.327 --> 14:37.208
How is gettin' hitched
gonna keep them apart?

14:37.409 --> 14:39.811
They aren't really gonna get married.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.899
They're just gonna get ready
to get married.

14:43.502 --> 14:46.185
No you, biscuit-wiscuit bear!

14:46.770 --> 14:49.759
Nope you, huggy-wuggy
snuggy bunny!

14:49.960 --> 14:52.335
Hi Miss Cheerilee, how are you?

14:52.924 --> 14:57.981
I have a very special somepony.

14:58.139 --> 14:59.917
Yeah, we noticed.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.707
Gosh, you two are so in love,

15:05.708 --> 15:09.070
the next thing you know,
you'll be getting married.

15:10.558 --> 15:11.581
Married?

15:11.682 --> 15:15.186
That's right. Married.

15:15.422 --> 15:16.782
Married.

15:21.718 --> 15:23.405
'Course, if you're gonna get married,

15:23.406 --> 15:26.168
you wanna pick out a really nice
diamond for your...

15:27.169 --> 15:30.037
...shmoopy-doopy-pookie-pie.

15:30.038 --> 15:31.038
Diamond!

15:32.110 --> 15:33.192
Shmoopy!

15:33.773 --> 15:37.103
Don't you think you should start
looking for your wedding dress?

15:37.104 --> 15:43.059
You'll wanna look your best for your...
honey-bunny snuggle-baby.

15:45.238 --> 15:46.113
Dress!

15:48.705 --> 15:50.853
Now we just need to keep them apart.

15:51.373 --> 15:53.162
I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied.

15:53.163 --> 15:54.839
You two do the same with Big Mac.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.320
No problem.

15:59.908 --> 16:02.972
Meet me back at the clubhouse in an hour,
when this whole mess is over.

16:06.638 --> 16:08.308
This one looks nice.

16:08.409 --> 16:09.806
Better try it on now.

16:19.150 --> 16:21.894
Ten minutes down,
fifty minutes to go.

16:27.933 --> 16:28.721
No.

16:29.903 --> 16:30.626
No.

16:31.550 --> 16:32.901
Not that one either.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.083
No.

16:34.647 --> 16:36.258
Too... shiny.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.475
No.

16:38.476 --> 16:41.244
You know, something less... shiny.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.151
Miss Cheerilee deserves the best.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.821
How much time is left?

16:46.822 --> 16:49.376
I'm running out of ways
to make diamonds sound bad.

16:49.490 --> 16:51.166
We still have twenty five minutes.

16:54.823 --> 16:55.746
Where's my brother?

16:55.947 --> 16:58.470
He made his purchase
and departed out the back.

16:58.471 --> 17:01.167
Said something about needing to see his...

17:01.168 --> 17:02.800
...shmoopy-shmoop.

17:05.419 --> 17:08.163
Okay, I'll see what I can do
to slow him down.

17:08.164 --> 17:10.638
You go on to Carousel Boutique
and warn Sweetie Belle.

17:39.950 --> 17:43.199
What's wrong? Where's Apple Bloom?
Where's Big Mac?

17:43.234 --> 17:46.904
On... his... way.

17:46.905 --> 17:52.668
Gotta... keep him... out of Boutique.

18:27.284 --> 18:28.245
Move away!

18:29.094 --> 18:30.195
He'll get to her!

18:30.296 --> 18:31.969
He's still strong!

18:34.804 --> 18:36.200
Let him go!

18:39.486 --> 18:40.999
Shmoopy-doo!

18:45.812 --> 18:48.530
I sure am glad we found those shovels.

18:54.063 --> 18:56.545
One more minute
and the spell will be broken!

18:56.546 --> 18:58.826
Shmoopy-doo!

18:59.688 --> 19:01.379
Sweetums?

19:10.462 --> 19:12.366
Shmoopy-doo!

19:42.652 --> 19:45.115
Please be normal, please be normal!

19:47.901 --> 19:50.346
Am I wearing a wedding veil?

19:50.347 --> 19:51.529
Eeyup.

19:53.346 --> 19:55.834
Are you sitting on a feather bed,
in a hole in the ground?

19:55.835 --> 19:57.060
Eeyup.

19:57.261 --> 20:02.020
Girls! Can you explain why I look like
I'm getting married at the bottom of a pit?

20:02.803 --> 20:06.907
We may have given you
the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion...

20:06.908 --> 20:10.941
...that may have turned out
to actually be a love poison.

20:10.942 --> 20:15.076
And you may have gone
just a teeny tiniest bit nutty.

20:15.077 --> 20:18.706
Well, we only did it because we thought
you and Big Mac would be really happy

20:18.707 --> 20:22.680
if you could be each other's very special
someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day.

20:23.694 --> 20:26.391
Our hearts and hooves
were in the right place.

20:27.031 --> 20:30.814
We appreciate that you care about us
and want us to be happy, but...

20:31.936 --> 20:34.633
But no matter how good
our intentions might have been,

20:34.634 --> 20:37.691
we shoulda never meddled
in your relationship.

20:38.142 --> 20:41.241
Nopony can force two ponies
to be together.

20:41.242 --> 20:46.137
It's up to everypony to choose that
very special somepony for themselves.

20:46.406 --> 20:48.469
We're sorry.

20:49.475 --> 20:52.197
And you can think about
how sorry you are

20:52.198 --> 20:56.265
while you're doing all of Big Mac's chores
at Sweet Apple Acres.

20:56.449 --> 20:59.639
Does that seem like
a fair punishment to you?

20:59.640 --> 21:01.003
Eeyup.

21:08.604 --> 21:11.493
Hey there, Miss Cheerilee!
What are you doing here?

21:12.320 --> 21:14.696
Since you three are doing
all of his chores,

21:14.697 --> 21:17.690
Big Mac and I thought we'd
have a picnic at the gazebo.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.709
Ready, sugar bear?

21:19.710 --> 21:21.823
Eeyup, pumpkin pie.

21:27.566 --> 21:32.023
NOOO!!!
