00:04.012 --> 00:06.516
I'm so sorry I lost track
of time on our picnic.

00:06.916 --> 00:09.409
I didn't mean for us to get
caught out here after dark,

00:09.624 --> 00:12.092
but there's really
nothing to be afraid of.

00:12.295 --> 00:15.224
The forest at night is the same
as the forest during the day...

00:19.212 --> 00:21.310
...only darker.

00:24.418 --> 00:27.280
Still, maybe we should
hurry back to the cottage.

00:30.861 --> 00:33.144
Nothing to worry
about. No reason to...

00:38.301 --> 00:39.581
RUN!

00:40.560 --> 00:41.298
AAAHHHH!

00:56.953 --> 01:01.175
Haw! Haw! Haw!

01:02.793 --> 01:05.649
Got ya! Ha ha ha!

01:09.772 --> 01:13.144
That wasn't funny.
You really scared me.

01:13.218 --> 01:14.393
I hope you're happy.

01:17.218 --> 01:21.126
Nope. You're too easy.
You're scared of everything.

01:21.513 --> 01:23.070
That's not true!

01:24.326 --> 01:24.664
Boo.

01:24.793 --> 01:25.323
AAAHHHH!

02:09.852 --> 02:13.150
I mean, how could you
not appreciate that?

02:13.458 --> 02:16.818
Because I don't think
being scared is very fun.

02:17.003 --> 02:19.335
I do! Your heart
gets all racey!

02:19.433 --> 02:23.138
Your hooves get all tingly.
Your mouth gets all dry-y.

02:24.381 --> 02:27.532
Actually, I don't like that
part, but the rest is great!

02:27.741 --> 02:31.956
See? Everypony likes a good
prank. They're just jokes.

02:32.055 --> 02:33.692
Now, Rainbow Dash,

02:33.920 --> 02:35.963
I don't think Fluttershy
would have called us all here

02:35.981 --> 02:38.326
to talk about this if she
thought it was funny.

02:38.510 --> 02:41.298
Everypony has things they
like and things they don't.

02:41.538 --> 02:44.030
And scaring Fluttershy
is just lazy.

02:44.996 --> 02:46.326
LAZY?

02:46.732 --> 02:47.963
A prank isn't
very good

02:47.987 --> 02:49.643
if you're the only
pony laughing.

02:49.963 --> 02:51.396
But what if it's really,
really, really, really,

02:51.415 --> 02:53.009
really, really funny?

02:53.243 --> 02:54.935
And I can do funny.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.963
I know you can. I guess
the trick is making sure

02:57.975 --> 02:59.175
that your idea of funny

02:59.206 --> 03:01.200
matches the pony you're
pranking. That way-

03:16.012 --> 03:20.473
Good one, Rainbow! You have
to admit. That was funny.

03:21.372 --> 03:22.418
Not really.

03:22.658 --> 03:26.018
Yeah. A whoopee cushion
is like a joke shortcut.

03:26.338 --> 03:27.520
WHAT!?

03:27.612 --> 03:28.947
Honestly, Rainbow Dash,

03:29.070 --> 03:30.923
if you are not willing
to put forth the effort

03:30.953 --> 03:33.575
required to pull a prank
that everypony can enjoy,

03:33.753 --> 03:35.556
you may as well not
pull one at all.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.612
Fine. If you ponies
want effort,

03:39.944 --> 03:41.735
then that's just
what you'll get.

03:44.332 --> 03:46.061
I'm not sure she
understood what we meant.

03:47.981 --> 03:50.713
I know you're excited about
the Filly Guide cookie drive,

03:50.861 --> 03:52.990
but I still have to do
a few finishing touches

03:53.021 --> 03:54.104
on your uniform.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.726
Mmmm. Not bad.

04:03.292 --> 04:06.689
Hmm. "You asked for it."

04:06.990 --> 04:07.944
What does it mean?

04:08.535 --> 04:12.233
Hmm. I assume this is
Dash's idea of a prank.

04:12.332 --> 04:14.713
Which can only mean she's
rigged some kind of booby trap

04:14.750 --> 04:16.676
to your Filly Guide
uniform up there.

04:17.150 --> 04:18.935
So... how do we
get it down?

04:19.261 --> 04:21.606
We don't. If Dash thinks
I'm going to fall

04:21.630 --> 04:22.812
for whatever she's
got in mind,

04:22.923 --> 04:24.166
she's got another
thing coming.

04:24.578 --> 04:27.347
There's more uniforms
where that one came from.

04:33.298 --> 04:36.080
Mmm. The sewing machine
cake is actually better

04:36.116 --> 04:37.335
than the cake cake!

04:37.956 --> 04:39.587
RAINBOW DASH!

04:39.883 --> 04:46.935
GOTCHA! Ha ha!
How's that for effort?

04:56.793 --> 04:58.110
What's all this, Applejack?

04:58.338 --> 04:59.858
I thought you were
gonna help me get ready

04:59.889 --> 05:01.532
for the Filly
Guide Cookie drive.

05:01.846 --> 05:05.415
Uh, yeah. Sorry about that,
but Rainbow Dash has been

05:05.433 --> 05:08.344
on a pranking tear and you
can never be too careful.

05:08.486 --> 05:10.984
Do you really think Dash
is gonna try to prank you

05:11.040 --> 05:11.840
in your sleep?

05:12.166 --> 05:14.240
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

05:15.538 --> 05:16.855
See you in the
morning, sugar cube.

05:26.910 --> 05:27.612
Huh?

05:29.858 --> 05:30.363
Whooooaa.

05:35.193 --> 05:43.538
Ha! Still think I'm
lazy? Gotcha! Ha ha!

05:44.080 --> 05:46.627
RAINBOW DASH!

06:03.956 --> 06:06.289
Ha ha! Got ya!

06:40.387 --> 06:41.501
Got ya!

06:50.000 --> 06:51.076
Got ya!

07:00.086 --> 07:01.089
Got ya!

07:09.790 --> 07:11.735
Pinkie, we need
your help.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.089
OK!

07:13.981 --> 07:14.683
For what?

07:15.113 --> 07:17.304
Are you honestly going to
stand there and tell us

07:17.341 --> 07:19.360
you know nothing about all
the pranking Rainbow Dash

07:19.403 --> 07:20.240
has been doing?

07:20.492 --> 07:23.655
Oh, no. She's been
pranking up a storm!

07:23.852 --> 07:25.489
Did she get you, too?

07:25.815 --> 07:28.240
Oh, yeah.
She and Gummy both...

07:31.329 --> 07:31.649
Boo.

07:32.092 --> 07:36.067
AHH-HAHAHA!

07:36.793 --> 07:38.640
They got me good.

07:38.904 --> 07:40.400
Well, she needs to stop.

07:40.566 --> 07:43.286
Stop? But pranks
are so much fun.

07:43.476 --> 07:46.067
Not for everypony and it
doesn't seem like Dash

07:46.092 --> 07:48.264
is taking the time to
find out who enjoys them

07:48.338 --> 07:49.507
and who doesn't.

07:51.286 --> 07:54.763
Uh, since you and Dash
share such an... affinity

07:54.793 --> 07:59.224
for pranking, we thought you
might be able to get her to, um...

08:00.123 --> 08:00.769
quit it.

08:10.701 --> 08:12.418
Hey, Rainbow Dash!

08:12.480 --> 08:15.612
I have something very
important to tell you.

08:16.049 --> 08:17.046
Pinkie! Hey.

08:17.347 --> 08:20.578
I actually have something
totally important to tell you!

08:20.978 --> 08:23.390
You do? Oh.
You go first!

08:25.138 --> 08:27.698
OK, you know how I've
been pranking everypony?

08:28.473 --> 08:31.581
Yeah. It's been
pretty funny.

08:31.907 --> 08:33.766
I-I mean, actually,

08:33.926 --> 08:36.307
that's what I have
to talk to you about.

08:36.812 --> 08:37.716
Here, have a cookie.

08:37.932 --> 08:39.384
Oooh. Thanks.

08:40.824 --> 08:43.618
So I got to thinking,
why waste my time

08:43.673 --> 08:45.889
pranking every
pony one at a time,

08:46.024 --> 08:48.369
when I could prank
everypony at once!?

08:49.113 --> 08:53.304
Wow. Everypony at
once? That sounds amazing.

08:53.926 --> 08:56.880
Uh. Wait. I mean,
it's not...

08:57.298 --> 08:58.769
You don't even know
what it is yet.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.812
Pinkie, this is going to
be the best prank ever!

09:03.120 --> 09:05.673
I special ordered
these joke cookies

09:05.741 --> 09:07.809
so the colors would
match my mane.

09:08.043 --> 09:08.861
And...?

09:09.230 --> 09:12.935
And I'm gonna switch them
with the Filly Guide Cookies.

09:13.464 --> 09:15.156
When Scootaloo and
her friends sell them,

09:15.298 --> 09:18.258
everypony in town's gonna
get a rainbow mouth,

09:18.381 --> 09:23.716
courtesy of Rainbow Dash, ha
ha! It's gonna be so awesome.

09:25.501 --> 09:27.138
Uh, I don't know.

09:27.156 --> 09:29.520
I mean, it doesn't really
seem all that funny.

09:30.338 --> 09:31.378
WHAT!?

09:31.649 --> 09:34.369
Maybe this is a good time to
stop pranking for a while.

09:34.689 --> 09:36.184
The other ponies
in town have--

09:36.221 --> 09:40.701
STOP!? No way! This prank
is happening, Pinkie.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.796
And it's going to
be hilarious!

09:55.950 --> 09:59.606
Pinkie! What's the deal? I
told you I needed your help

09:59.704 --> 10:01.243
switching out all the
Filly Guide Cookies

10:01.286 --> 10:02.504
for the joke cookies.

10:02.566 --> 10:05.304
But when you didn't show, I
had to do it all by myself!

10:07.944 --> 10:09.027
Uh, Pinkie?

10:12.972 --> 10:15.680
Wow. Your face is
still pretty rainbowed.

10:15.950 --> 10:20.166
Yeah. I haven't really
been feeling well,

10:20.498 --> 10:22.289
and these joke cookies
are the only thing

10:22.320 --> 10:23.963
that makes me feel better.

10:26.006 --> 10:27.950
You don't have any
more, do you?

10:28.215 --> 10:32.209
Uh, no. I just told you. I
used them all for the prank.

10:32.467 --> 10:33.187
Oh.

10:33.796 --> 10:36.430
Pretty soon, the CMCs
will start selling them

10:36.449 --> 10:37.895
to every pony in town.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.363
Ponies will open their
boxes and start eating.

10:40.652 --> 10:42.855
Then all of their teeth
will turn rainbow-colored

10:42.935 --> 10:44.436
and they'll know it was me.

10:44.621 --> 10:47.643
It's gonna be so awesome! Come
on. You don't want to miss it.

10:47.790 --> 10:52.886
Actually,I don't think
I can even stand up...

10:53.581 --> 10:55.550
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT
MORE COOKIES!

10:55.689 --> 11:00.692
Agh! On second thought, maybe
you better stay here and rest.

11:01.126 --> 11:03.138
Yeah. You're right.

11:03.655 --> 11:07.550
Sorry to miss out. I'm sure
it's going to be hilarious.

11:19.076 --> 11:22.400
All right, who's ready
to sell some cookies?

11:22.707 --> 11:23.790
ME!

11:23.895 --> 11:25.280
Look, here, Rainbow Dash.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.760
I know you promised
Scootaloo you'd help out,

11:27.969 --> 11:29.883
but I don't want
none of your pranks

11:29.926 --> 11:31.409
ruinin' these
fillies' night.

11:31.716 --> 11:33.827
Look, I'll be with
you the whole night

11:33.864 --> 11:35.698
so you can totally
keep an eye on me.

11:36.246 --> 11:38.676
Come on, Applejack,
let's get started.

11:38.898 --> 11:41.329
Yeah! We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

11:41.569 --> 11:43.618
We wanna hit every
house in Ponyville!

11:46.541 --> 11:50.393
Come on! You heard her.
Every house in Ponyville.

11:50.640 --> 11:51.680
Heh heh heh.

12:54.381 --> 12:56.246
I think you three
should be real proud.

12:56.572 --> 12:59.027
Y'all did a mighty impressive
job for your first go-round.

12:59.298 --> 13:01.993
You took the words right
out of my mouth, Applejack.

13:02.246 --> 13:04.283
Isn't that right,
Rainbow Dash?

13:08.018 --> 13:10.184
Any minute now.

13:10.609 --> 13:12.935
Uh...any minute now, what?

13:13.267 --> 13:15.495
Huh? Oh. Uh, nothing.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.049
Have you guys noticed
how quiet it's gotten?

13:18.338 --> 13:20.129
I mean, it's still
early, right?

13:20.430 --> 13:21.747
Of course it's quiet.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.329
Ponies can't talk
while they're eating

13:23.347 --> 13:24.941
those fabulous cookies!

13:25.501 --> 13:26.203
You think?!

13:26.467 --> 13:27.249
Of course.

13:27.495 --> 13:30.953
They're probably all in
a cookie coma right now.

13:31.304 --> 13:34.024
Huh. Maybe you're
right. I'll go check.

13:42.449 --> 13:44.492
What is going on?

13:48.578 --> 13:51.403
OK, definite
cookie-eating happening.

13:51.624 --> 13:53.520
But where is everypony?

13:53.876 --> 13:56.553
They must have seen their
rainbow mouths by now.

13:57.107 --> 13:59.040
They should all be running
out into the streets.

13:59.747 --> 14:02.406
Unless everypony
went to bed early.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.046
Pinkie?

14:15.323 --> 14:16.849
The whole town
got the cookies

14:16.898 --> 14:19.144
and now everypony is
shut up in their houses!

14:19.495 --> 14:21.273
You don't think there's
something wrong

14:21.298 --> 14:23.470
with the joke
cookies, do you?

14:30.646 --> 14:33.427
Mrs. Cake! Whew.
Have you seen Pinkie?

14:33.673 --> 14:35.661
I was thinking I might
have something to do

14:35.692 --> 14:36.880
with her not feeling great.

14:40.750 --> 14:43.107
Uh, Mrs. Cake?

14:47.021 --> 14:51.575
Cooookies! Cooooookies!

14:51.624 --> 14:53.415
Uhhhhh...I can see you're
busy. I'll come back.

14:58.443 --> 15:01.963
COOOOKIEEEES!

15:03.716 --> 15:07.273
More coookies.

15:07.593 --> 15:10.393
COOOOKIEEEES....

15:15.040 --> 15:18.707
COOOOKIEEEES....

15:18.904 --> 15:21.390
COOOOKIEEEES....

15:21.501 --> 15:23.790
More coookies

15:27.070 --> 15:30.652
More cookies!

15:45.643 --> 15:48.763
Twilight! You've gotta come
with me to Sugarcube Corner.

15:48.929 --> 15:50.763
Something's going
on with the Cakes.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.040
Well, not something, exactly.

15:53.107 --> 15:56.209
I mean, it may have something
to do with these joke cookies.

15:58.252 --> 16:01.347
COOOKIEEEEES...

16:01.384 --> 16:02.067
Oh no.

16:02.467 --> 16:05.575
COOOOKIEEEEES.....

16:10.953 --> 16:11.476
Fluttershy?

16:11.544 --> 16:13.883
COOOOKIEEEEES.....

16:19.815 --> 16:26.012
COOOOKIEEEEES.....

16:29.649 --> 16:34.092
COOOOKIEEEEES.....

16:34.547 --> 16:36.541
You sure you don't mind
us all coming over?

16:36.732 --> 16:38.061
Oh, of course not.

16:38.203 --> 16:40.283
I think the girls have
earned a little celebration

16:40.338 --> 16:41.470
for all of their hard work.

16:41.926 --> 16:44.818
And I have plenty of sewing
machine cake left over.

16:45.224 --> 16:47.520
Unless, anypony
wants a cookie.

16:47.587 --> 16:49.200
Don't touch those!

16:49.483 --> 16:51.840
Oh! There is certainly
no call for that.

16:51.975 --> 16:53.981
There is plenty
for everypony.

16:54.141 --> 16:55.944
Come on! We've got
to get out of here.

16:56.246 --> 16:58.609
What in tarnation are
you going on about?

16:58.720 --> 17:00.578
There's no time! You
have to follow me!

17:00.812 --> 17:04.000
Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you
want all those cookies,

17:04.067 --> 17:07.046
you will have to buy them,
just like everypony else.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.473
I don't want the cookies-

17:12.941 --> 17:14.547
--but they do.

17:14.843 --> 17:16.369
Whhh-what's happening?

17:16.658 --> 17:18.455
I'll explain later! Come on!

17:19.150 --> 17:20.812
COOOOOOOKIEEEEEEESSSSS!

17:22.430 --> 17:24.646
We need to find
somewhere to hide!

17:28.030 --> 17:30.000
Cooooookies.

17:30.049 --> 17:30.886
This way!

17:44.221 --> 17:45.212
Did we lose them?

17:46.818 --> 17:49.624
Why are we running from
the ponies of Ponyville?

17:49.790 --> 17:51.766
What happened to
all of our friends?

17:53.372 --> 17:55.673
I think it's something
in the cookies.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.449
Uh, that's ridiculous.

17:58.590 --> 18:01.027
Filly Guide Cookies
haven't changed for years.

18:01.236 --> 18:03.421
It's not like there's a new
ingredient that's turning

18:03.458 --> 18:05.993
the whole town into
cookie-craving zombies.

18:07.403 --> 18:09.772
Unless there is.

18:10.061 --> 18:11.446
What are you saying?

18:11.846 --> 18:13.680
What did you do?

18:14.553 --> 18:19.286
COOKIEEEES.....

18:21.489 --> 18:22.935
Cover the windows!

18:23.113 --> 18:26.572
COOOOOOKIIEEEEEEEES!

18:35.624 --> 18:38.750
OK. So, I may have switched
all the Filly Guide Cookies

18:38.806 --> 18:40.590
for joke cookies that
were supposed to make

18:40.640 --> 18:43.150
ponies' mouths rainbow, but
somehow turned everypony

18:43.175 --> 18:45.415
into mindless cookie-eating
zombies instead.

18:45.698 --> 18:48.449
I figure we just hide out here
until the effects wear off

18:48.578 --> 18:51.193
and as long as nopony
else eats the cookies,

18:51.243 --> 18:52.387
we'll be fine

18:52.621 --> 18:56.092
That's lovely, darling,
except for one thing...

18:56.338 --> 19:00.867
We've already eaten them.

19:02.340 --> 19:06.978
Looks like your prank
up and backfired.

19:10.147 --> 19:13.593
COOOOKIEEEES!

19:16.596 --> 19:20.412
Cooooookies...

19:20.775 --> 19:22.043
More... Cookies...

19:22.090 --> 19:25.046
No. Stay away. They're
making you sick!

19:25.212 --> 19:26.381
You don't want these.

19:26.504 --> 19:32.330
But we dooo. We want COOKIES.

19:33.169 --> 19:36.763
Please. Stop! I never
meant for this to happen.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.504
It was just a harmless prank.

19:38.640 --> 19:42.326
It was supposed to be funny.
But this isn't funny at all!

19:43.421 --> 19:45.396
Exactly!

19:49.729 --> 19:50.596
What?

19:50.873 --> 19:52.695
Wait. What's happening?

19:53.298 --> 19:55.630
Just delighting in
pranking the prankster.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.224
He-heh, yeah.

19:57.366 --> 19:59.975
How does it feel to get
some of your own medicine?

20:00.566 --> 20:04.313
So, you're not sick?
None of you are?

20:04.510 --> 20:06.775
Of course not, silly.

20:07.003 --> 20:08.800
GOTCHA!

20:10.449 --> 20:13.636
This... was all... a PRANK?

20:13.821 --> 20:16.184
Yep. And you can
thank Pinkie Pie.

20:16.529 --> 20:19.224
After you told her about your
plan to prank the whole town,

20:19.470 --> 20:22.000
she got everypony together
and came up with a way

20:22.036 --> 20:23.809
to turn the tables on you.

20:24.116 --> 20:26.953
Aw, shucks. It was nothing.

20:27.015 --> 20:28.941
Just a little something
I threw together.

20:29.593 --> 20:30.763
Uh...

20:31.144 --> 20:33.636
Wow. You should
see your face.

20:33.778 --> 20:35.870
Ha ha! Talk about funny!

20:36.990 --> 20:39.316
Well, I don't think
it's very funny!

20:39.452 --> 20:43.452
And I'm the one that got
pranked. I was really scared.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.550
I thought I made everypony sick.

20:45.778 --> 20:46.984
You can't just go around...

20:47.089 --> 20:48.990
Pranking whoever
you feel like?

20:49.267 --> 20:51.575
Without thinking about how
it might make them feel?

20:51.833 --> 20:53.243
Or if they'd even enjoy it?

20:53.544 --> 20:55.200
Or think it's funny?

20:55.433 --> 20:59.963
Yeah! Oh. I see
what you did there.

21:00.418 --> 21:02.547
Pranks can be a lot
of fun when everypony

21:02.572 --> 21:05.347
has a good time. I thought
you just needed to see

21:05.372 --> 21:07.163
what it's like
when they don't.

21:07.489 --> 21:10.775
I guess I did. I'm
sorry, everypony.

21:11.046 --> 21:14.080
I haven't really been thinking
about how other ponies feel.

21:14.270 --> 21:16.818
Well, I hope you
learned your lesson.

21:17.070 --> 21:19.981
Totally! You ponies pulled
off an amazing prank.

21:20.098 --> 21:22.529
I'll have to work
extra hard to top it.

21:25.433 --> 21:26.160
Gotcha!
