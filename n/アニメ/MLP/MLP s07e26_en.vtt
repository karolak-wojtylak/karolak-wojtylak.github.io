WEBVTT

00:04.071 --> 00:05.304
That's the last entry...

00:05.406 --> 00:08.107
Starswirl's final words
before he vanished!

00:08.209 --> 00:10.876
Applejack: All those legendary
ponies were real too?

00:10.978 --> 00:13.413
And then NONE of them were
ever heard from again?

00:13.515 --> 00:16.015
Twilight: They used their magic to
open a portal to limbo

00:18.353 --> 00:20.152
<i> We need to find items</i>
<i> that are connected</i>

00:20.254 --> 00:21.621
<i> to the pillars in some way.</i>

00:22.223 --> 00:23.389
We brought you back!

00:23.491 --> 00:26.525
You cannot bring ONLY
the pillars back!

01:14.108 --> 01:16.041
Your pitiful attempt
to imprison me

01:16.143 --> 01:18.377
has FAILED, Starswirl!

01:20.814 --> 01:22.681
You must return us to limbo.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.616
It's the only way to stop him.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.752
I only figured out
how to bring you back.

01:26.954 --> 01:27.853
Working on it..

01:27.955 --> 01:29.554
No table of contents..

01:29.656 --> 01:31.657
Allow me to assist.

01:43.369 --> 01:44.068
There!

01:44.370 --> 01:49.274
Without the power of Ponehenge,
your banishing spell is useless.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.210
You have studied my writings.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.312
Surely you have some other plan!

01:53.514 --> 01:56.348
No... I just wanted to save
you, I didn't think--

01:56.450 --> 01:57.348
Don't fret.

01:57.450 --> 02:01.887
When I extinguish the light and
hope of this miserable world,

02:02.089 --> 02:04.089
you won't remember any of this.

02:05.091 --> 02:05.991
No!

02:08.294 --> 02:11.730
This one is almost.. as
strong as you, Starswirl.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.632
But even in my weakened state,

02:13.734 --> 02:16.101
she cannot stop the
might of shadows!

02:20.674 --> 02:22.908
Lucky for her,
she's not alone!

02:25.912 --> 02:27.179
ARRGGGHHH!

02:27.281 --> 02:28.880
Know this, fiend.

02:29.082 --> 02:33.418
We will not rest until we find
a way to return you to limbo.

02:34.822 --> 02:35.654
Never!

02:35.956 --> 02:38.223
Your days of glory are
through, Starswirl.

02:38.625 --> 02:44.563
Now my dark power will reign
and you six will bow to me!

02:47.700 --> 02:49.735
Um, where'd he go?

02:50.137 --> 02:52.137
That is a riddle
we must unravel.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.205
And quickly.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.240
How long have we been gone?

02:55.442 --> 02:57.242
Over a thousand years.

02:58.544 --> 03:02.681
Then my spell worked... before
it was meddled with.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.517
And the realm has been at
peace for a millennia!

03:05.719 --> 03:09.120
Well, we did have to save
everypony from Nightmare Moon

03:09.222 --> 03:11.290
and Discord and Chrysalis and
King Sombra and Lord Tirek and

03:11.392 --> 03:13.158
there was that one time when
Starlight traveled through time

03:13.260 --> 03:14.660
and almost destroyed
life as we know it!

03:15.362 --> 03:17.329
But that's all in the past.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.831
If you are truly
this accomplished,

03:19.933 --> 03:23.368
we will stop the Pony of
Shadows twice as fast together.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.036
We shall see.

03:25.138 --> 03:28.640
It is an easy thing to say
you have saved the world.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.842
It is quite another to do it.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.012
Oh, we've saved
the world, beardo.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.681
And we can do it again.

03:35.783 --> 03:39.751
Be that as it may, the problem
of locating the Pony of Shadows

03:39.853 --> 03:43.122
remains and this land is vast.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.190
It sounds like you need a map.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.759
Luckily, we have just the thing.

03:49.362 --> 03:52.598
Something about this
magic seems familiar.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.904
Did you know he
could do that?

03:59.106 --> 04:00.005
He's Starswirl!

04:00.107 --> 04:01.240
He can do anything!

04:02.042 --> 04:07.012
This map and, indeed, this very
castle are grown from the seed

04:07.114 --> 04:09.815
we planted over a
thousand years ago.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.183
Then it did work!

04:11.485 --> 04:12.283
What worked?

04:12.385 --> 04:15.787
Each of us infused a crystal
seed with our magic

04:15.889 --> 04:18.990
in hopes that it would grow
into a force for good.

04:19.092 --> 04:23.194
We wanted to leave something
to protect the realm in our absence,

04:23.296 --> 04:27.899
but we never dreamed our gift
would become so powerful.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.602
Y'all mean the
elements came from you?

04:33.373 --> 04:35.307
You know, the sparkly
crystal things that grow

04:35.409 --> 04:37.576
from the Tree of Harmony
and represent each of us?

04:38.178 --> 04:38.844
Laughter.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.678
Honesty.

04:39.980 --> 04:40.746
Generosity.

04:41.148 --> 04:41.880
Loyalty.

04:42.082 --> 04:42.814
Kindness.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.849
And magic!

04:46.252 --> 04:50.622
They are reflections of our own
elements of hope, strength,

04:50.824 --> 04:54.860
beauty, bravery,
healing and sorcery.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.532
We had no idea our
small seed would bloom

05:00.634 --> 05:02.735
into the living
spirit of the land.

05:03.137 --> 05:07.339
I am glad our mantles have
passed to such capable ponies.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.909
More importantly, we
no longer need Ponhenge

05:11.011 --> 05:13.245
to send our foe
back to limbo.

05:13.547 --> 05:17.649
We can use the stored magic in
this "Tree of Harmony."

05:17.851 --> 05:20.519
But doesn't a banishing spell
take a lot of power?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.988
We'd have to sacrifice
the elements for that.

05:23.090 --> 05:23.955
Mm hm.

05:24.057 --> 05:24.823
They'd be gone...

05:24.925 --> 05:25.891
Forever?

05:26.093 --> 05:28.693
Starswirl, I don't think
the Tree can survive

05:28.795 --> 05:29.728
without the elements.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.497
If it dies, Equestria
will suffer.

05:32.699 --> 05:36.868
If the Pony of Shadows has his
way, your land will not exist!

05:37.070 --> 05:40.305
So unless you have
a better idea...

05:46.613 --> 05:51.083
Our foe will seek dark places
from which to draw power.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.151
I will prepare my spell,

05:53.353 --> 05:55.988
so that we may strike as
soon as you find him.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.756
What are we waiting for?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.358
I like your spirit!

05:59.760 --> 06:01.426
Uh huh! Oh yeah!

06:06.199 --> 06:07.433
What about
this one?

06:08.835 --> 06:11.505
Sea Pony etiquette isn't going
to help right now, Spike.

06:13.207 --> 06:16.041
Uh, Twilight?
Are you OK?

06:16.243 --> 06:18.844
I just unleashed ultimate
evil and doomed Equestria

06:18.946 --> 06:20.712
because I was obsessed
with meeting my idol!

06:20.814 --> 06:22.214
Why wouldn't I be OK!?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.350
Pfft. You didn't know that
was gonna happen.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.686
But I should have listened to
you and left things alone.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.889
Now the elements of harmony
will be lost to fix my mistake!

06:31.191 --> 06:32.824
Maybe there's another way.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.194
If there is, Twilight
will find it.

06:37.363 --> 06:39.865
Portal gate... portal keys...
portal spells.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.868
YES! If the Pillars can hold
open the gateway to limbo,

06:42.970 --> 06:45.537
a powerful pony can do the
banishing spell herself!

06:45.739 --> 06:47.005
Do you know what this means!?

06:47.174 --> 06:49.875
[pant] I can stop carrying books?

06:50.177 --> 06:52.311
The Pillars don't have
to leave Equestria!

06:52.513 --> 06:53.812
Even though we'll
lose the elements,

06:53.914 --> 06:55.614
we'll have the ponies
that created them.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.083
And the Pony of shadows
will be banished for good!

06:58.685 --> 07:00.685
That's.. great. Heh.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.954
But I was thinking
of another way

07:03.056 --> 07:06.325
that maybe doesn't involve
"banishing" at all?

07:06.727 --> 07:09.628
Starswirl knew what he was
doing when he cast that spell.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.029
If I can make it
even better,

07:11.131 --> 07:14.032
maybe he'll see that I take
magic as seriously as he does.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.606
It seems the dark places

07:21.708 --> 07:24.109
Starswirl indicated on
the map have changed.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.977
I bet the Pony of Shadows

07:26.079 --> 07:28.313
would've loved the
Ghastly Caverns

07:28.615 --> 07:30.615
before 1000
years of erosion

07:30.717 --> 07:32.584
turned it into the
Ghastly Gorge.

07:32.686 --> 07:36.421
The "Appeloosian Wastes" sure
sounded dark and desolate.

07:36.723 --> 07:37.622
Who knew they would become

07:37.724 --> 07:39.958
such a popular square
dancing destination?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.127
And I get how this
part of Equestria

07:42.229 --> 07:44.095
used to be cast
in eternal night

07:44.297 --> 07:47.866
where the Pony of Shadows could
draw power and wreak havoc

07:47.968 --> 07:50.869
while ponies were powerless
to stop him, but,

07:51.271 --> 07:52.571
IT'S KINDA MADE A COMEBACK.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.673
DID I MENTION IT'S
REALLY BRIGHT?

07:59.312 --> 08:03.582
It seems there are fewer dark
corners in the realm these days.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.283
Isn't that a good thing?

08:05.385 --> 08:08.119
True. The Pony of Shadows
will have a hard time

08:08.221 --> 08:09.321
regaining power.

08:09.423 --> 08:12.158
When he rears his
head, we'll be ready!

08:13.160 --> 08:16.495
Isn't there some way to banish
him without losing all of you?

08:16.697 --> 08:18.864
[sigh] I wish there were.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.701
But to save our home, we
are willing to leave it.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.769
I don't think you'll have to!

08:24.871 --> 08:26.069
My spell isn't finished yet,

08:26.271 --> 08:28.340
but I think we can send The
Pony of Shadows to limbo

08:28.442 --> 08:30.209
without all of you
having to go as well!

08:31.744 --> 08:35.781
While I appreciate your
enthusiasm, Twilight,

08:35.983 --> 08:40.351
this is hardly the time to take
risks on half-baked spells.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.788
Begging your pardon,
Mr. The Bearded.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.825
But Twilight doesn't
do anything half-way.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.528
Especially not magic!

08:49.630 --> 08:54.099
Seriously! She got her wings by
finishing one of your spells.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.167
I think you'll find her
work is worth reading

08:56.269 --> 08:58.002
before you dismiss
it out of hoof!

08:58.104 --> 08:58.738
Mm hm!

08:59.640 --> 09:01.806
While it is an
unconventional approach,

09:02.208 --> 09:03.642
I believe it could work.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.077
Hm.

09:05.179 --> 09:07.446
I suppose there
is a chance.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.849
But we still have no idea
where to find the villain.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.526
Maybe we should try there?

09:27.600 --> 09:28.967
The Hollow Shades.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.570
I think a branch of the
Apple family lives there.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.705
They'd have to be
pretty distant.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.641
The Hollow Shades was
abandoned eons ago.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.577
Hm, that's odd.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.145
The only time the map's called
all of us to one place

09:41.247 --> 09:42.747
was Starlight's village.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.617
So it's like a
super-villain tracker!

09:46.419 --> 09:47.519
No offence.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.355
Do you think the map could
be trying to tell us

09:50.457 --> 09:51.756
where the Pony of Shadows is?

09:51.958 --> 09:52.756
Hmmm.

09:52.958 --> 09:57.095
The Tree of Harmony acting to
protect the light of the realm....

09:57.297 --> 09:59.130
Yes, a good thought, Twilight.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.201
I will make my
notes on this spell.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.336
Ready yourselves for battle.

10:04.538 --> 10:07.406
Uh, I know I'm not as
experienced as all of you,

10:07.508 --> 10:10.075
but is banishment
really the only option?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.110
I mean, it's been a long time.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.347
Maybe the Pony of
Shadows is ready to talk?

10:15.549 --> 10:19.017
I doubt we can save our
homeland with a conversation.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.517
But we could try.

10:20.619 --> 10:24.355
Starlight, I'm sure Starswirl
and the others did try.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.492
The Pony of Shadows was not
interested in reconciliation.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.428
Once a villain,
always a villain.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.331
Twilight? Sunburst?
Would you accompany me?

10:33.533 --> 10:36.135
I wish to refine this
spell for our use.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.405
Come! We must prepare
for the struggle ahead.

10:42.342 --> 10:45.477
[sigh] I know Starswirl
is a great wizard,

10:45.479 --> 10:48.480
but this whole
plan seems... wrong.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.816
The map's only ever sent us
to solve friendship problems.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.252
Maybe so, but the
Pony of Shadows

10:54.354 --> 10:57.088
doesn't really seem like the
friendship type.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.188
Honestly?

10:58.390 --> 10:59.825
We don't know
anything about him.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.894
Nopony does.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.963
That's not entirely true.

11:12.872 --> 11:16.541
You all knew the Pony of Shadows
before he became what he is now.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.309
You must've been friends..

11:18.411 --> 11:19.444
So what happened?

11:20.846 --> 11:23.281
The tale of our
rift is a sad one.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.834
Rockhoof:<i> Stygian was a pony</i>
<i> like the rest of us,</i>

11:43.036 --> 11:44.669
<i>though more scholar than hero.</i>

11:44.971 --> 11:46.705
<i> He recognized our</i>
<i> emerging world</i>

11:46.807 --> 11:49.040
<i> would need champions</i>
<i> to defend it.</i>

12:07.526 --> 12:09.327
Flash Magnus:<i> He may have</i>
<i> gathered us together,</i>

12:09.729 --> 12:12.697
<i> but he, himself was just</i>
<i> an ordinary unicorn</i>

12:12.799 --> 12:14.999
<i> who soon grew jealous</i>
<i> of our abilities.</i>

12:16.869 --> 12:19.605
Mistmane:<i> He stole objects</i>
<i> from each of us ...</i>

12:20.607 --> 12:23.142
<i> artifacts to use in a spell.</i>

12:23.944 --> 12:26.377
Meadowbrook:<i> And we cast</i>
<i> him out for it.</i>

12:28.781 --> 12:30.348
Somnambula:<i> We always</i>
<i> thought he'd return</i>

12:30.450 --> 12:31.983
<i> and seek forgiveness.</i>

12:32.385 --> 12:36.756
<i>But when we saw him again, his</i>
<i> heart was bent on revenge.</i>

12:37.858 --> 12:40.491
<i> He dashed even my</i>
<i> hope of saving him.</i>

12:44.064 --> 12:46.464
But why did he steal
the artifacts from you?

12:46.566 --> 12:50.702
No doubt it was an enchantment
to take our powers for himself.

12:51.104 --> 12:51.871
Hm.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.577
That looks like a lot of work.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.080
It is what must be done
and it would be best

13:02.182 --> 13:03.682
if we were not disturbed.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.985
I'm sorry, Starlight, but
we can't stop to talk.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.553
The stakes are too
high and we have to...

13:08.655 --> 13:11.056
banish Stygian to limbo.
I get it.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.157
Uh, who?

13:12.259 --> 13:14.893
Stygian was the name the
Pony of Shadows gave up

13:14.995 --> 13:16.895
when he turned to darkness.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.630
And I'm just trying
to figure out why.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.133
Envy. He wanted more
power than he had

13:22.235 --> 13:24.168
and that desire led
him down a path

13:24.270 --> 13:26.171
from which there is no return.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.374
I know from experience
that's not always true.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.542
When the map called
you six to my village,

13:31.644 --> 13:33.111
it was for a
friendship problem.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.179
Are you sure this is different?

13:35.281 --> 13:35.879
I...

13:35.981 --> 13:39.350
Stygian wants to destroy all
that is good in this world.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.353
There's no way to
befriend a pony like that.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.824
I guess I'm lucky your
idol wasn't around

13:45.926 --> 13:47.992
when you decided to
be my friend.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.395
I might've been
banished to limbo too.

13:57.236 --> 13:59.604
Somnambula: I am glad we
have the chance to see

13:59.706 --> 14:03.174
what has grown from our
efforts so long ago.

14:03.276 --> 14:06.044
It seems a shame
to harm it.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.646
A necessary sacrifice.

14:07.748 --> 14:08.746
With the elements' power,

14:08.848 --> 14:10.849
we will bind the Pony
of Shadows in limbo.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.183
And thanks to Twilight,

14:12.285 --> 14:14.919
we will remain to watch
over the realm ourselves.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.235
Um, how do we use them?

14:31.437 --> 14:34.072
Well, you--Oh. I'm not sure.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.406
They simply work for us.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.075
The elements are
attuned to you.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.043
We must use their
magic in pairs.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.445
No problem!

14:40.547 --> 14:43.381
We're used to banishing
evil before breakfast.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.951
And it'll be an honor to
save Equestria with y'all.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.723
I really hope Twilight
knows what she's doing.

14:55.862 --> 14:58.062
I don't remember reading
anything that said

14:58.164 --> 14:59.999
the Hollow Shades
was like this.

15:00.801 --> 15:04.302
Oh... the Pony of Shadows
must have twisted it

15:04.404 --> 15:05.703
to his purposes.

15:08.774 --> 15:11.276
[evil laugh]
Prepare yourselves.

15:11.678 --> 15:12.977
He is here.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.447
Stygian! Show
yourself and face us!

15:16.549 --> 15:19.983
[evil laughter]
[rumbling]

15:33.799 --> 15:36.901
I definitely would have
remembered reading about this.

15:45.144 --> 15:48.079
Welcome to the Well of Shade!

15:48.681 --> 15:52.583
When you turned your backs on
me, I discovered this place.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.453
The darkness spoke to me of
a power beyond any

15:55.555 --> 15:58.523
I could imagine and I listened.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.025
The shadow and I became one.

16:01.427 --> 16:04.629
Soon all of the realm
will be the same.

16:04.831 --> 16:08.532
Then all ponies will
feel the despair I did

16:08.634 --> 16:10.435
when you cast me out!

16:10.637 --> 16:12.370
We did
what we had to do.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.774
You tried to steal our
powers for yourself!

16:16.176 --> 16:18.476
No! It was you who were selfish!

16:18.778 --> 16:21.512
And now you will pay!

16:23.950 --> 16:26.851
Are you still sure this
isn't a friendship problem?

16:27.753 --> 16:28.386
Ready?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.854
Open the portal...

16:31.924 --> 16:32.891
NOW!

16:45.938 --> 16:48.606
No! You will not
trap me again!

16:48.908 --> 16:50.508
Twilight! Push him in!

16:52.277 --> 16:52.812
Huh?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.314
There's... a pony in there.

17:03.755 --> 17:04.622
Are you...

17:04.724 --> 17:05.690
Stygian?

17:06.292 --> 17:07.792
I was, once.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.961
Until my friends betrayed me.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.630
But Starswirl says
you betrayed them.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.298
You wanted their magic.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.601
No! I wanted
their respect.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.069
I brought them
together.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.104
I planned strategy and
I read all I could

17:20.206 --> 17:21.639
about the beasts we faced.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.775
But I didn't have
magic or strength.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.844
So nopony ever noticed me.

17:26.646 --> 17:30.048
I went to Ponehenge to make my
own copies of the artifacts.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.417
With them, I thought I
could be a Pillar too!

17:32.619 --> 17:34.619
And stand by their
side in battle.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.488
I never wanted to
steal their power.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.391
But instead of sharing
and letting me help,

17:40.593 --> 17:42.226
my friends threw me out.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.829
So I became stronger
than any of them!

17:45.031 --> 17:47.598
The darkness welcomed me
when no pony would.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.134
I will do what I
must to protect it!

17:50.536 --> 17:52.336
This is all a
misunderstanding!

17:52.538 --> 17:54.238
If the Pillars
knew how you felt,

17:54.340 --> 17:56.807
I'm sure they wouldn't have
turned their backs on you.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.110
The shadow isn't
who you really are.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.312
Let me help you
be Stygian again.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.781
Even if my friends
did still care,

18:03.883 --> 18:06.684
what makes you think you
have the power to help me?

18:06.886 --> 18:08.519
Starlight: Because it's
what she does.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.990
I wasn't so different from you
and Twilight helped me change.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.526
If there's one pony in Equestria
that can save a friendship,

18:15.728 --> 18:16.761
it's her.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.431
I--I want to believe you....

18:20.633 --> 18:23.134
But the darkness
will not be stopped!

18:31.244 --> 18:32.811
Fight the darkness, Stygian!

18:33.113 --> 18:34.779
You don't need it anymore.

18:35.381 --> 18:38.749
Revenge isn't what you
want, friendship is!

18:40.919 --> 18:41.853
Twilight!

18:46.960 --> 18:48.793
Ugh.. the shadow won't let go of him.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.396
He wants to stop, but
he can't do it alone!

18:51.998 --> 18:53.531
Then we must help him.

19:19.392 --> 19:23.628
YEAH! It felt so good
to do that again!

19:23.930 --> 19:25.830
Friendship power rush!

19:25.932 --> 19:26.631
WOO!

19:27.633 --> 19:28.499
The elements!

19:28.601 --> 19:29.867
They didn't disappear.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.303
Maybe because we used them
for healing magic

19:32.405 --> 19:33.638
instead of banishing?

19:33.940 --> 19:34.505
Look!

19:37.476 --> 19:39.910
Long ago you needed
our help, Stygian,

19:40.112 --> 19:43.081
but instead of listening,
we turned our backs on you.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.516
Pride clouded my judgment.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.652
I owe you an apology.

19:48.054 --> 19:52.256
Thank you for helping us see the
errors of our ways, Twilight.

19:52.358 --> 19:56.260
It seems I never accounted
for the magic of friendship.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.396
Thank you, Swirlstar.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.898
Er... Starswirl!

20:04.036 --> 20:04.969
AHEM.

20:05.371 --> 20:09.907
So apparently a conversation
can save Equestria?

20:11.309 --> 20:15.980
Something tells me I will be
making a lot of apologies today.

20:19.651 --> 20:22.620
I simply cannot believe
how tall you've gotten!

20:22.922 --> 20:26.157
Well, it has been
over a thousand years.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.893
Will you stay here and
teach magic once again?

20:29.095 --> 20:32.563
My sister and I have such fond
memories of your lessons.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.266
As long as you don't ask for
those essays we owed you

20:35.368 --> 20:36.834
before you disappeared.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.738
I am not certain Canterlot
is where I belong.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.508
The realm has grown and I
believe I'll have a look around

20:44.610 --> 20:46.777
before I settle
in any one place.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.948
And I long to see what
has become of my home.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.417
I believe we all do.

20:53.319 --> 20:56.454
Then I hope you will return to
Canterlot on occasion

20:56.556 --> 20:59.123
and share the wisdom of
your great experience

20:59.225 --> 21:01.626
with the next
generation of ponies.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.695
We would be honored, but
if it is wisdom you seek,

21:04.997 --> 21:07.131
look no further
than your own pupil.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.700
She showed me that the
power of friendship

21:09.902 --> 21:12.070
is a magical force indeed.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.105
And that in turning
away from others,

21:14.307 --> 21:16.074
you hurt yourself as well.

21:19.878 --> 21:21.846
It's funny. I thought
meeting my idol

21:21.948 --> 21:24.148
would give me all the
answers I ever wanted.

21:24.250 --> 21:27.018
But instead, I forgot
what I already knew.

21:27.420 --> 21:30.254
Good thing I had a student
of my own to remind me.
