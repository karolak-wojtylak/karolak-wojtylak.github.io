WEBVTT

00:06.528 --> 00:08.915
Twilight?
Can you slow down a bit?

00:09.871 --> 00:12.648
Sorry, Spike. It's just Pinkie
Pie, Rarity and Applejack

00:12.684 --> 00:14.640
are getting back from their
Seaward Shoals boat trip.

00:14.702 --> 00:16.555
And I can't wait to
hear all about it!

00:18.475 --> 00:20.915
It's such a shame Rainbow Dash
and Fluttershy had to miss it

00:20.968 --> 00:23.142
for their Cloudsdale
Flight School reunion.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.924
Maybe the rest of us not going
was for the best anyway.

00:26.191 --> 00:28.373
I know the three of them
were really looking forward

00:28.426 --> 00:29.626
to getting out of their element.

00:30.986 --> 00:32.315
Getting out of their element?

00:32.773 --> 00:35.102
I think they all just
wanted to try something new.

00:35.457 --> 00:37.893
Huh. I guess a boat
trip qualifies as that.

00:38.235 --> 00:40.008
My only worry is
they'll be so excited,

00:40.044 --> 00:40.937
they'll talk over
each other

00:40.955 --> 00:42.235
and I'll miss some
of the details.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.582
Just to be safe, I may
need you to take notes.

00:45.115 --> 00:46.320
Uh, right.

00:56.844 --> 00:58.440
So how was the trip?

01:07.986 --> 01:10.008
Well, at least you don't
have to worry about them

01:10.035 --> 01:11.324
talking over each other.

01:58.155 --> 02:00.128
I don't know what happened
on that boat trip,

02:00.225 --> 02:02.845
but once Rarity, Applejack,
and Pinkie Pie have some tea

02:02.870 --> 02:06.020
and talk it out, I'm sure
everypony will feel better.

02:12.020 --> 02:13.600
Come on in,
everypony.

02:15.730 --> 02:19.255
Gummy, Opalescence, and
Winona? This is a surprise.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.735
Are Pinkie Pie, Rarity
and Applejack with you?

02:28.260 --> 02:31.025
"Sorry darling, but I must
decline the invitation

02:31.055 --> 02:32.050
to your soirée.

02:32.380 --> 02:35.005
While I'm sure it will be
positively resplendent,

02:35.170 --> 02:38.150
there are certain ponies I'd
rather not associate with

02:38.220 --> 02:40.235
at the moment. Rarity."

02:42.305 --> 02:45.195
Rarity's not coming? Aww.

02:45.455 --> 02:47.570
So I polished my
scales for nothing.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.855
"Sorry I can't make it,
but I'm still a mite upset

02:55.880 --> 02:58.975
about everything that happened
on the boat. Applejack."

03:00.740 --> 03:02.975
"Sorry I can't make
the tea party today,

03:03.065 --> 03:05.355
but there's a small problem
with the guest list.

03:05.575 --> 03:07.890
Plus, I'm right in the middle
of a very important cupcake.

03:08.235 --> 03:09.345
Pinkie."

03:11.295 --> 03:13.625
Come on, Spike. Since our
friends won't come here

03:13.650 --> 03:16.225
and tell us what happened,
we'll just have to go to them.

03:16.875 --> 03:17.840
Right behind you.

03:26.440 --> 03:31.565
I am sorry,
but my mane wasn't made

03:31.600 --> 03:32.980
to support marine life.

03:37.070 --> 03:39.430
Ruined. Completely ruined.

03:39.790 --> 03:41.615
I don't know, Rarity.
Maybe you could--

03:41.670 --> 03:44.195
Throw it away? Yes, I agree.

03:44.295 --> 03:47.860
Just another innocent casualty
of that disastrous boat trip.

03:48.385 --> 03:49.405
About that.

03:49.610 --> 03:52.160
Spike and I were wondering
what happened out there.

03:53.940 --> 03:56.810
Please, darling, I don't
know if I'll ever be able

03:56.855 --> 03:59.130
to discuss it. It's
far too painful.

04:00.580 --> 04:02.115
If it's too difficult
to talk about,

04:02.210 --> 04:03.385
we completely understand.

04:04.335 --> 04:05.875
Well, since you
dragged it out of me:

04:06.560 --> 04:08.775
It all started
at the docks.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.650
I knew Applejack and Pinkie
Pie wanted to get out

04:11.700 --> 04:15.085
of their element, so I
thought I would surprise them

04:15.275 --> 04:17.115
with an elegant cruise.

04:18.375 --> 04:21.805
I had brought a small bag with
just a few key essentials.

04:22.605 --> 04:23.660
All right, ponies.

04:23.875 --> 04:26.915
Prepare yourselves for
luxury on the high seas!

04:27.425 --> 04:29.705
That sounds... fun.

04:33.960 --> 04:37.310
The sea air carries a portent
for trouble this day.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.685
T'is a treacherous
and perilous journey

04:39.720 --> 04:40.950
that lies ahead of us.

04:41.250 --> 04:44.915
We sail to adventure
or our very doom.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.450
I have no idea
what you just said,

04:49.575 --> 04:52.975
but your wardrobe is
delightfully seaworthy!

04:57.695 --> 05:00.995
Despite Applejack's
colorful seafarer attitude,

05:01.445 --> 05:03.725
I was still determined
to get my friends

05:03.765 --> 05:05.570
out of their element
by providing them

05:05.595 --> 05:08.370
with all the refinements
of a luxury cruise.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.345
I'd made sure to bring the
most delectable nibbles

05:11.400 --> 05:12.595
for them to enjoy.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.435
Oooh. I brought food, too!

05:16.665 --> 05:19.635
Let's see, I've got cotton
candy, taffy, circus peanuts

05:19.700 --> 05:22.000
and lots of other
super-yummy stuff.

05:22.470 --> 05:26.025
Oooh Pinkie Pie, that all
looks positively delectable,

05:26.190 --> 05:29.355
but you simply must try one
of these cucumber sandwiches.

05:29.935 --> 05:30.975
Dig in!

05:31.255 --> 05:37.100
Hmmm.

05:37.425 --> 05:39.615
Arrgh! Get those off me ship!

05:43.825 --> 05:45.405
Ohh, I'm so sorry.

05:45.545 --> 05:48.810
I had no idea you had such
distaste for cucumbers!

05:49.080 --> 05:52.360
Yar-har-har-har!
Hardy-har-har-har.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.790
Hmmm. That doesn't
sound like Applejack.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.550
Well, hold on, because
it gets even worse.

06:00.715 --> 06:02.280
Pinkie tried to
lighten the mood

06:02.320 --> 06:04.420
with some fun
maritime games.

06:06.670 --> 06:10.710
It's Piñata O'clock! Wanna
give it a whack, Rarity?

06:10.935 --> 06:12.215
Oh, darling, of course!

06:15.975 --> 06:18.985
Har-har! Har-har!

06:19.090 --> 06:21.260
I'll be chartin' a
course to the very heart

06:21.295 --> 06:22.340
of that maelstrom.

06:28.365 --> 06:31.120
Uh, Applejack?
Just a thought,

06:31.165 --> 06:34.805
but maybe we should steer the
ship toward calmer waters.

06:35.030 --> 06:38.740
This be the only
way to Plunder Cove.

06:45.665 --> 06:48.230
Perhaps if I take a quick
look-see at that map of yours,

06:48.265 --> 06:50.470
I could find us a more
cruise-friendly path.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.970
There'll be no mutiny
aboard me ship!

06:53.485 --> 06:55.870
Look at me! I'm
the captain too!

06:56.590 --> 06:59.910
<i> Clearly Pinkie Pie had caught</i>
<i> Applejack's sea madness.</i>

07:07.090 --> 07:12.640
Is that all you've
got? Yar-hahah-HAR!

07:14.470 --> 07:15.575
Then what happened!?

07:16.175 --> 07:18.045
Oh, the boat sank, obviously.

07:23.265 --> 07:26.875
So, Applejack got some
sort of "sea madness"

07:26.930 --> 07:29.140
and caused the
boat to capsize?

07:29.675 --> 07:32.395
After all the effort I put
in to provide her and Pinkie

07:32.415 --> 07:34.100
with the exact luxury
cruise they needed

07:34.140 --> 07:35.360
to get out of
their elements,

07:35.635 --> 07:38.105
that is how
Applejack thanked me.

07:38.465 --> 07:40.970
So, you were stuck out in
the middle of the ocean?

07:41.155 --> 07:42.985
How in Equestria
did you get back?

07:43.570 --> 07:46.830
Spike, darling, you'll
have to forgive me.

07:47.140 --> 07:49.225
I'm far too emotionally
drained to discuss

07:49.255 --> 07:50.605
the matter any further.

07:50.910 --> 07:53.630
Rarity? I don't suppose
there's any chance

07:53.665 --> 07:57.505
you might be uh, exaggerating
things just a little?

07:58.070 --> 08:01.850
Well! I can assure you that
that is exactly what happened.

08:02.165 --> 08:05.270
And if you don't believe
me, you can ask Pinkie Pie.

08:05.595 --> 08:08.115
I am quite certain her
story will be the same.

08:09.330 --> 08:12.490
So, that's what Rarity said
happened on the boat, huh?

08:15.480 --> 08:18.665
We thought there was a
chance she might have [ahem]

08:18.790 --> 08:21.120
embellished the
story just a tad.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.655
So we wanted to hear about
what happened from you.

08:23.845 --> 08:26.325
Did Applejack really
capsize the boat?

08:26.830 --> 08:29.235
Of course not!
That's just silly.

08:29.365 --> 08:31.550
There's no way Applejack
could have sank the boat.

08:32.035 --> 08:33.190
I knew it!

08:33.390 --> 08:34.400
That's a relief.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.305
Because Rarity did!

08:36.965 --> 08:37.610
What?!

08:38.065 --> 08:40.270
It all started on the docks.

08:42.150 --> 08:44.045
I knew Rarity and
Applejack wanted to get

08:44.065 --> 08:46.245
out of their element, so
I figured I'd throw them

08:46.300 --> 08:48.925
the funnest, silliest
boat party ever.

08:49.135 --> 08:51.930
But I guess Rarity
had other ideas.

08:54.665 --> 08:57.360
<i> I thought I overpacked</i>
<i> until I saw Rarity</i>

08:57.410 --> 08:59.765
<i> and her team of</i>
<i> porter ponies.</i>

09:01.840 --> 09:04.260
Prepare yourselves
for a luxury cruise!

09:04.560 --> 09:08.390
A day of opulence,
decadence and extravagance!

09:09.665 --> 09:10.950
That sounds fun.

09:11.185 --> 09:14.665
Ahoy, mateys! Batten
down the hatches, ya'll

09:14.715 --> 09:17.810
'cause this here's gonna be
a boat ride of adventure!

09:18.290 --> 09:19.820
I can live with that.

09:30.025 --> 09:32.440
Huh. They just keep coming.

09:34.025 --> 09:36.810
<i> Now you can't throw a silly</i>
<i> boat party without snacks,</i>

09:38.210 --> 09:40.720
<i> so I made sure to pack</i>
<i> the funnest party food</i>

09:40.745 --> 09:41.650
<i> I could find.</i>

09:43.530 --> 09:46.030
Rarity? Would you care
for some cotton candy?

09:46.130 --> 09:48.165
It's freshly spun!

09:48.622 --> 09:53.625
Oh, Pinkie Pie, those all
look simply... well, simple.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.650
But they're obviously
unfit for a luxury cruise.

10:00.355 --> 10:02.855
Now my cucumber sandwiches
on the other hoof...

10:03.210 --> 10:05.710
Try one. Then you'll understand.

10:07.055 --> 10:09.560
Oh, are those
chocolate-chip?

10:16.060 --> 10:19.055
Sorry, cucumber sandwiches
are so ten seconds ago.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.670
Wait, wait, wait. That
doesn't sound like Rarity.

10:23.030 --> 10:25.565
Just wait until you hear
how much more unlike her

10:25.600 --> 10:26.440
she sounds!

10:26.715 --> 10:28.740
I thought I'd lighten
the mood with some

10:28.775 --> 10:30.740
super-fun party boat games.

10:31.005 --> 10:34.110
But Rarity was a
real wet blanket.

10:35.255 --> 10:38.955
It's Piñata Time! Oooh! Wanna
give it a whack, Rarity?

10:43.380 --> 10:46.880
Oh, you were serious.
Well, that's adorable.

10:48.590 --> 10:49.695
I'll give it a go!

10:49.985 --> 10:54.310
That's the spirit. Let's get
this boat party started!

10:59.350 --> 11:00.995
Whoa, doggy!

11:14.910 --> 11:17.300
Tug of war? Now we're talking!

11:19.270 --> 11:20.965
Whoever wins gets to
be captain!

11:26.620 --> 11:28.975
Or one of us could
just be captain now.

11:33.300 --> 11:37.465
Oh don't worry, dear.
Luxury cruises never sink!

11:37.585 --> 11:38.375
What?!

11:42.935 --> 11:45.095
And that's why
the boat sinking

11:45.135 --> 11:47.075
was all Rarity's fault.

11:47.625 --> 11:51.830
That seems odd. I mean,
we trust you, of course,

11:52.070 --> 11:54.705
but it's all so
extraordinary.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.920
Oh, it's extraordinary,
all right.

11:58.070 --> 11:59.445
But that's exactly
what happened.

11:59.590 --> 12:01.315
In fact, the only thing
I might have gotten wrong

12:01.355 --> 12:03.140
was that there were
even MORE porter ponies.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.925
But just to be safe, you
should talk to Applejack.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.220
She'll know exactly how many
porter ponies there were.

12:08.050 --> 12:11.865
OK, but if the boat sank,
how did you all get rescued?

12:12.180 --> 12:13.775
Oh, that's easy. We just...

12:14.780 --> 12:16.455
My muffins!

12:17.135 --> 12:19.915
That's it. We've got to
go talk to Applejack.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.260
Good idea. She'll
straighten this out.

12:22.405 --> 12:24.720
I just really, really want to
know how they made it back.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.670
But yeah, that'd be great, too.

12:29.940 --> 12:33.535
Hold on a tick. Pinkie Pie
says it's Rarity's fault

12:33.605 --> 12:36.120
And Rarity says I
sank the boat?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.020
Well, that's plum crazy.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.825
If you two really want to know
what happened, I'll tell ya.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.515
Y'all know how Pinkie
Pie and Rarity wanted to

12:43.545 --> 12:44.765
get out of their element?

12:45.135 --> 12:47.685
Well, I brought a treasure map
to give 'em a rip-roaring,

12:47.735 --> 12:48.960
seafaring adventure!

12:50.225 --> 12:52.865
<i> But they had other ideas.</i>

12:53.450 --> 12:55.960
La-la-la! Prepare
yourselves for the most

12:56.035 --> 12:59.490
luxurious boat outing
that ever outed a boat!

13:01.390 --> 13:04.415
And more fun than you
can shake a stick at

13:05.075 --> 13:07.360
because I brought a stick!

13:07.690 --> 13:10.775
All right, mateys. But just
y'all wait till you see

13:10.800 --> 13:13.425
the high-seas adventure
I've got planned.

13:24.710 --> 13:27.730
<i> Unfortunately, they</i>
<i> seemed less interested</i>

13:27.765 --> 13:29.445
<i> in a treasure</i>
<i> hunting adventure</i>

13:29.595 --> 13:32.055
<i> and more interested</i>
<i> in snacks.</i>

13:34.905 --> 13:37.270
Oh darling, that food
isn't fit for a pony

13:37.295 --> 13:39.860
of proper breeding, darling
and refinement, darling.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.005
Now my cucumber sandwiches
on the other hoof...

13:43.545 --> 13:45.575
Betcha I can fit
them all in my mouth!

13:46.940 --> 13:48.370
Pinkie, darling, please!

13:50.320 --> 13:51.785
Uh-oooh!

13:52.575 --> 13:53.280
Agh!

13:58.920 --> 14:01.110
Rarity, I--

14:01.220 --> 14:03.210
Well, I never! Humpha!

14:04.030 --> 14:06.145
Me neither! Humpha!

14:08.905 --> 14:10.485
Do you want to say
it or should I?

14:10.850 --> 14:11.510
I'll go.

14:11.755 --> 14:14.275
That sure doesn't sound
like Rarity or Pinkie Pie.

14:14.605 --> 14:17.235
Oh, it gets a sight
worse than that.

14:19.500 --> 14:23.085
It's P.W.T.!
Piñata-whacking time!

14:23.985 --> 14:27.290
Oh, darling, "whacking"
is a base pastime

14:27.325 --> 14:30.805
for common ponies, doesn't
interest me in the least.

14:33.415 --> 14:34.105
Meh.

14:37.040 --> 14:37.995
Hee hee!

14:38.170 --> 14:38.920
Huh?

14:43.615 --> 14:46.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:51.385 --> 14:53.285
Looks like we need
to change course.

14:55.630 --> 14:58.315
Oooh! Why, this will
make a perfect tablecloth

14:58.345 --> 14:59.650
for my cheese board.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.155
Maybe so, but it's also the
only way to find Thunder Cove!

15:04.685 --> 15:06.925
And Pinkie Pie was
just about as helpful

15:06.955 --> 15:08.585
as a weasel in a hen house.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.815
Captain Pinkie Pie
reporting for map duty!

15:21.620 --> 15:22.865
Hold on, everypony!

15:27.140 --> 15:30.285
Wait, so it was Rarity
and Pinkie's fault?

15:30.550 --> 15:33.805
Yup. And maybe if
they ever apologize,

15:33.910 --> 15:35.605
I'll consider talking
to them again.

15:37.995 --> 15:39.555
If they all blame
each other,

15:39.715 --> 15:41.805
I don't know how we're going
to get them to talk again.

15:42.140 --> 15:45.195
Neither do I,
Spike. Neither do I.

15:50.970 --> 15:53.890
There's got to be some way
to fix this. If Applejack,

15:53.960 --> 15:56.475
Pinkie Pie, and Rarity keep
not talking to each other,

15:56.665 --> 15:58.880
they could forget what good
friends they really are.

15:59.315 --> 16:00.995
I just don't get it.

16:01.150 --> 16:03.000
All of their stories
are so different.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.550
We're never going to figure
out what really happened.

16:07.615 --> 16:09.160
Their stories were different,

16:09.235 --> 16:11.385
but they also had
a lot in common.

16:11.810 --> 16:15.045
I guess. They were all on
a ship that sank and...

16:15.575 --> 16:16.470
that's about it.

16:16.870 --> 16:18.165
Not quite.

16:25.290 --> 16:28.880
Ah-ha! Not only do I think
I know how the boat sank,

16:29.070 --> 16:31.975
I have a pretty good idea
how to get Rarity, Applejack,

16:32.030 --> 16:34.125
and Pinkie Pie back together!

16:38.725 --> 16:41.200
I hope this plan of yours works.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.755
Winona brought me your note
about a friendship emergency.

16:46.125 --> 16:47.130
How can I help?

16:48.305 --> 16:50.275
Opalescence delivered
your message, Twilight.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.535
What's the emergency?

16:52.125 --> 16:54.080
It's a good thing it was time
for Gummy's bath, or I might

16:54.120 --> 16:56.540
not have seen your note about
the emergency, Twilight.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.750
What's she doing here?

17:00.215 --> 17:02.290
Sorry, but I just
didn't know how else

17:02.320 --> 17:03.965
to get the three of
you here together.

17:04.130 --> 17:07.425
And there really is a
friendship emergency. Yours!

17:08.355 --> 17:12.410
Oh, there's no emergency. I'm
just waiting for an apology.

17:12.930 --> 17:14.440
An apology?

17:14.540 --> 17:15.415
What?

17:15.675 --> 17:17.315
Why would you want
me to apologize,

17:17.375 --> 17:19.080
when it was Rarity's fault?

17:19.185 --> 17:20.490
What are you
talking about?

17:20.550 --> 17:22.585
Applejack clearly
caused the boat to sink!

17:22.640 --> 17:24.635
She stranded us in the
middle of the ocean!

17:25.020 --> 17:28.960
UGH! Will somepony please
tell me how you made it back?

17:41.240 --> 17:44.610
Well, maybe it wasn't
the middle of the ocean.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.275
Even so, I don't appreciate
being hornswoggled

17:49.305 --> 17:50.395
into coming back here.

17:51.415 --> 17:52.985
On that, at
least we agree.

17:53.135 --> 17:53.795
Yeah.

17:54.195 --> 17:56.155
I know you each have a
different perspective

17:56.195 --> 17:58.620
on how the boat capsized
and blame each other...

17:59.045 --> 18:00.435
but if you come on
the boat with me,

18:00.545 --> 18:02.385
I'll show you what
really happened.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.955
Well, not that I
have any doubt,

18:06.990 --> 18:09.305
but it will feel good for
everypony to see exactly

18:09.350 --> 18:10.855
whose fault it was.

18:11.180 --> 18:13.230
I think we all
know which pony's

18:13.270 --> 18:14.980
about to be proven right.

18:16.555 --> 18:18.120
We sure do!

18:19.275 --> 18:21.935
Like I said, I sure
hope this works.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.110
Heh heh heh.

18:28.330 --> 18:31.675
Whatever you're looking for,
I hope you find it soon.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.180
Don't worry, Spike. I've
got it all under control.

18:35.770 --> 18:38.010
While all of your stories
seemed very different,

18:38.260 --> 18:42.240
they all had something in
common. Cucumber sandwiches!

18:45.360 --> 18:47.645
What in the hay does that
have to do with anything?

18:50.160 --> 18:53.125
And why would you waste a
perfectly good hors d'œuvre?

18:53.210 --> 18:55.540
You also mentioned
the bubbling water.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.795
And the swell.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.430
Cucumber just happens
to be the favorite food

19:03.465 --> 19:07.235
of the Tri-horned Bunyip. And
bubbles, followed by a swell

19:07.415 --> 19:09.450
is what happens when they
swim up to the shallows

19:09.500 --> 19:10.600
from deep water!

19:11.925 --> 19:15.815
So, we attracted a tri-horned
whatchamacallit...

19:16.205 --> 19:18.210
With cucumber
sandwiches?

19:18.390 --> 19:20.540
Sounds like a stretch.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.530
Hello, Bunyip, sir.

19:29.675 --> 19:31.250
So that's a...

19:31.345 --> 19:32.710
A Tri-horned Bunyip...

19:32.865 --> 19:34.870
Who's very sorry
he accidentally

19:34.905 --> 19:36.995
knocked over your
boat, right?

19:38.790 --> 19:42.020
Wait; the storm had nothing
to do with the capsizing?

19:42.450 --> 19:43.345
Nope.

19:43.710 --> 19:46.790
All right. Even if our friend
the Bunyip is responsible

19:46.830 --> 19:47.810
for sinking the boat,

19:47.895 --> 19:50.850
that still doesn't excuse
a certain pony's behavior.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.430
Me!? How about you
and Pinkie Pie?

19:54.515 --> 19:56.565
Pfft! Wha-?! How- ME?--

19:56.700 --> 19:58.490
I think I can
explain that too.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.005
Each one of you spent so
much time trying to come up

20:01.060 --> 20:02.460
with the perfect way
to get the others

20:02.505 --> 20:04.555
out of their element,
that you didn't notice

20:04.590 --> 20:06.335
your friends were
doing the same thing.

20:06.875 --> 20:11.100
Wait a minute. You brought all
those games and things for us?

20:11.500 --> 20:14.400
Of course! I figured the boat
trip was the perfect time

20:14.430 --> 20:16.330
to do things that
were silly and fun.

20:16.945 --> 20:19.430
And I was just trying
to give the two of you

20:19.605 --> 20:21.855
the elegant cruise I
thought you deserved.

20:22.205 --> 20:25.355
And I just wanted to give you
two a high seas adventure,

20:25.670 --> 20:28.005
since that'd be something
new and different for y'all.

20:28.710 --> 20:30.975
OOOOHHHHHHH.

20:31.275 --> 20:33.135
That is so sweet.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.280
You must have gone
through so much trouble.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.750
Well, not half as much
trouble as you did

20:37.795 --> 20:41.290
making all that fancy food.
And bringing all those games.

20:41.590 --> 20:44.400
I guess this just teaches us
that even longtime friends

20:44.425 --> 20:46.165
need to work at communication.

20:46.470 --> 20:48.400
Well, there's something
I'd like to communicate

20:48.435 --> 20:49.785
to you all right now.

20:49.980 --> 20:53.395
You girls are the best friends
a pony could ever have.

20:53.830 --> 20:56.080
Oh, let's never
fight again!

20:56.345 --> 20:57.100
Agreed.

20:57.155 --> 20:57.850
You've got it!

21:00.125 --> 21:02.680
All right, you big
softy. Bring it in.

21:07.655 --> 21:10.865
Come on, Bunyip,
sir. You've got it!

21:20.030 --> 21:21.485
One thing's for sure, Spike.

21:21.610 --> 21:24.370
There's nothing like a
luxurious adventure boat party

21:24.395 --> 21:26.325
to get you out of your element.

21:28.490 --> 21:30.100
You said it!
