WEBVTT

00:01.934 --> 00:03.435
Twilight: I can't believe
you two are going

00:03.537 --> 00:04.803
on a Friendship Quest!

00:05.005 --> 00:06.338
This is amazing!

00:06.940 --> 00:08.607
What do ya mean, Twilight?

00:08.709 --> 00:10.442
We've been on one
together before.

00:10.744 --> 00:11.610
Exactly!

00:11.712 --> 00:13.212
This is the first time
the map has teamed up

00:13.314 --> 00:15.381
the same ponies for
a second quest!

00:15.983 --> 00:17.817
That <i>is</i> special!

00:17.919 --> 00:22.354
Heh. Must be 'cause we're extra good
at solvin' friendship problems.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.422
Twilight: I hope so.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.258
Cause it looks like this one
might be a little tricky.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.028
You're going to
the Peaks of Peril.

00:29.530 --> 00:33.032
The... Peaks of... P-P-P-Peril!?

00:33.334 --> 00:34.800
Aw, it's just a name.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.135
It doesn't mean anything.

00:36.237 --> 00:39.204
Like how Cloudsdale
is in the clouds,

00:39.306 --> 00:42.307
and the Crystal Empire
is made of crystal?

00:42.709 --> 00:43.509
Fair point.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.278
So what can you tell us
about the place, Twilight?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.846
Only what Rockhoof told me.

00:47.948 --> 00:51.216
Back in his day, nopony knew
much about the Peaks of Peril.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.986
Except for the legend on
this ancient shield.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.955
It says a group called the
Kirin used to live there,

00:57.157 --> 00:59.591
known for their kindness
and truth-speaking.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.094
Now we know why
the map called us.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.731
Unfortunately, other
creatures also lived there.

01:05.833 --> 01:09.335
The Nirik. Fearsome beasts
of pure fire.

01:09.737 --> 01:14.005
[shudder] Maybe...you should go
instead of me, Twilight.

01:15.175 --> 01:16.508
Sorry, Fluttershy.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.843
Flanks don't lie.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.047
Aw, I'm sure the two of us'll
get that friendship problem

01:22.149 --> 01:24.683
solved, no matter what
kinda creature has it.

02:15.169 --> 02:18.304
Guess nopony else is goin'
out as far as we are.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.840
Maybe they know
something we don't..

02:21.042 --> 02:24.076
Now Fluttershy, I've
told you a dozen times!

02:24.178 --> 02:25.010
There's nothing
to be scared--

02:27.748 --> 02:29.281
[old pony's voice]
I'm sorry.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.220
You really startled us!

02:34.622 --> 02:38.023
Oh it's just that I'm not
used to seeing anypony

02:38.125 --> 02:42.394
taking the train to...
the end of the line.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.197
[ominous]
The final destination.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.833
The last stop!

02:48.335 --> 02:50.003
We get the picture. Why?

02:50.705 --> 02:56.775
Nothing but uncharted terrain
and wild beasts out that way...

03:09.390 --> 03:13.092
Well, maybe there's a little
somethin' to be scared of.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.628
Eeyah!

03:24.672 --> 03:25.671
Agh!

03:32.313 --> 03:35.080
Those must be the
Peaks of Peril. Phew.

03:35.182 --> 03:38.016
Tough goin', huh
Fluttersh-- Fluttershy?

03:40.154 --> 03:40.853
Agh!

03:46.093 --> 03:46.992
Oh!

03:54.568 --> 03:58.937
There. That should be enough
flowers to keep your tree cozy.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.341
Fluttershy!

04:02.443 --> 04:04.176
What are you doin'!?

04:04.278 --> 04:06.679
This is no time for
visitin' varmints!

04:06.781 --> 04:09.014
We're on a friendship
quest, remember?

04:09.516 --> 04:11.783
Yes, but actual--
-Come on!

04:11.885 --> 04:13.319
We're burnin' daylight!

04:14.021 --> 04:16.255
I know, but what I
found out is that--

04:16.357 --> 04:17.957
Now, we gotta get up that peak.

04:18.159 --> 04:20.325
I figure if we use some
rope and elbow grease,

04:20.427 --> 04:21.127
we can make it up half--

04:21.229 --> 04:23.896
APPLEJACK! CAN YOU
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME?

04:24.398 --> 04:27.499
[Ahem] What I'm
trying to say is,

04:27.601 --> 04:29.434
the squirrels told me
a short cut they take

04:29.536 --> 04:30.769
to the Kirin village.

04:37.144 --> 04:40.112
Oh. Heh heh.
Sorry, Fluttershy.

04:40.214 --> 04:43.182
I s'pose I got a little too
caught up in the adventure.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.750
That's all right.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.752
If you hadn't come
back to get me,

04:46.854 --> 04:49.488
I probably would've talked
to the squirrels all day!

04:57.365 --> 04:59.698
[rustling]
I hope that's not a Nirik..

05:06.473 --> 05:07.806
Show yourself!

05:17.818 --> 05:18.851
Well, hi!

05:18.953 --> 05:21.386
I'm Applejack, and this
here is Fluttershy.

05:27.461 --> 05:30.695
If you have any friendship
problems, we're here to help!

05:35.502 --> 05:37.170
Huh. Quiet bunch,
ain't they?

05:38.272 --> 05:40.372
We're from Equestria.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.708
And we're plum-tickled
to meet y'all.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.445
S-So...

05:46.747 --> 05:48.447
What are <i>your</i> names?

05:51.018 --> 05:55.955
APPLEJACK.
FLUTTERSHY. Remember?

05:56.457 --> 05:58.657
Maybe they don't
understand us.

05:59.759 --> 06:00.392
Do.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.326
You.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.861
Understand.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.062
Ponish?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.968
Oh! But you
don't speak?

06:12.072 --> 06:14.073
Don't or won't?

06:14.375 --> 06:16.408
Will you excuse
us for a moment?

06:18.746 --> 06:22.748
You have to ask "yes or no"
questions, or they won't answer.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.683
Like talkin' to
Angel bunny?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.085
Not exactly.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.454
I can always tell
what Angel is feeling.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.957
But these Kirin,
don't show anything.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.160
Well, how are we gonna
solve a friendship problem

06:35.262 --> 06:37.597
if none of 'em will
tell us what it IS?

06:51.778 --> 06:55.513
These Kirin are quieter than
an apple blossom on snowfall!

06:55.615 --> 06:58.249
Still. There's gotta be some
way to make 'em speak.

07:00.288 --> 07:03.588
Heh heh. Beautiful day,
ain't it?

07:07.360 --> 07:08.260
Knock knock!

07:08.962 --> 07:10.929
Now you say "who's there?"

07:13.266 --> 07:14.099
Police!

07:14.401 --> 07:15.667
Police who?

07:16.169 --> 07:18.169
POLICE say somethin'?

07:22.376 --> 07:26.544
Uh oh. I feel a
sneeze comin' on!

07:26.646 --> 07:28.980
ACHOOOO!

07:30.851 --> 07:31.850
Fluttershy:
Gesundheit!

07:32.352 --> 07:33.118
Ugh!

07:33.520 --> 07:35.620
Don't ANY of y'all talk?

07:41.528 --> 07:43.428
Now we're gettin' somewhere!

07:43.530 --> 07:46.931
A dark spooky path that
leads into unknown territory!?

07:47.033 --> 07:48.199
Tell ya what,
sugarcube.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.068
You stay and see if
you can get anything

07:50.170 --> 07:51.302
out of these here Kirin.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.405
I'll go try to find
one that talks.

07:53.807 --> 07:58.309
Phew! Be careful! And
watch out for Niriks!

08:12.159 --> 08:12.724
Aaaah!

08:15.128 --> 08:16.094
Phew...

08:17.197 --> 08:17.963
Aaah!

08:18.465 --> 08:20.965
Oh! Have you seen a
Kirin that talks?

08:23.404 --> 08:25.203
Any idea where
I should look?

08:27.408 --> 08:29.441
Oh, for the love
of Celestia!

08:29.543 --> 08:31.242
Can't you just
say SOMETHIN'?

08:33.146 --> 08:34.846
[laugh] Gotcha!

08:34.948 --> 08:36.915
Sorry, sorry but
that was too good.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.683
Oh, you don't know
how much I miss jokes.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.952
HI-larity! Am I
pronouncing that right?

08:41.054 --> 08:43.722
Some words I haven't said
in a wil.. While.. While.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.091
Hi, I'm Autumn Blaze.

08:45.593 --> 08:48.193
You've just arrived and perhaps
you're tired or hungry,

08:48.295 --> 08:50.629
or reflective, and want to
sleep and eat and journal?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.998
Which you should do! Of
course. But first, OH! OH!

08:53.100 --> 08:55.534
What joy to talk with another
creature, it's been so long!

08:55.636 --> 08:57.235
You must tell me
everything about you;

08:57.337 --> 08:58.737
there's so much to
say, so much to DO!

08:58.839 --> 09:00.772
Oh, look at me, I'm going
on and you haven't seen--

09:00.874 --> 09:02.758
I mean have you seen--?
What am I saying?

09:02.859 --> 09:04.543
Of course, you haven't,
you just so I will-

09:04.645 --> 09:05.444
Follow me.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.114
That was somethin', all right.

09:16.290 --> 09:17.557
Oh, wow!

09:18.959 --> 09:21.159
This.. is amazing!

09:21.261 --> 09:22.895
Oh, you think so too?

09:23.497 --> 09:25.730
The way the light shimmers
off everything like...

09:25.832 --> 09:27.866
like it all suddenly woke
up the moment you saw it,

09:27.968 --> 09:31.136
and you realize maybe the water
and the mountains and the forest

09:31.238 --> 09:33.772
and the, yes the rainbow
and the stars and the sky

09:33.874 --> 09:36.341
are all looking back at you
thinking the same thing?

09:36.443 --> 09:38.677
That we are a part
of the everything.

09:38.779 --> 09:42.148
That maybe there's just one
thing, and we are all it!

09:43.050 --> 09:47.319
I was gonna say "it's
pretty," but yeah.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.055
Ha ha ha! [sniff] Mmmmm.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.857
And this is just the
first stop on a journey

09:51.959 --> 09:54.059
of amazing things to see,
smell, tiptoe through!

09:54.161 --> 09:57.062
Oh I haven't been able to share all
of this with anypony in forever,

09:57.164 --> 09:58.964
since they all took
that vow of silence,

09:59.066 --> 10:02.868
so it's a lot for me to, you
know, PROcess. Pro-CESS.

10:03.070 --> 10:03.970
Er. Deal with.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.939
Whoa, there...
Vow of silence?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.509
That's uh, that's why
they asked me to leave.

10:10.911 --> 10:14.112
I hope it's not a sore subject,
but you mind explaining

10:14.214 --> 10:16.715
why y'all went quiet
in the first place?

10:17.217 --> 10:18.484
It's a long story.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.620
[sigh] You'd rather not
talk about it?

10:22.222 --> 10:23.722
No.

<i>   ♪  Yeah, sometimes you've

13:36.516 --> 13:38.516
Ah! I can't believe it!

13:38.618 --> 13:41.752
No pony should give up
feelin' their feelins,

13:41.854 --> 13:43.488
just to keep from
gettin' angry.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.089
That's what I said!

13:45.291 --> 13:47.125
Y'know, when I
started talking again.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.695
[gasp] I bet this here's the problem
that Fluttershy and I

13:50.797 --> 13:52.096
came to help y'all with!

13:52.298 --> 13:53.598
Really? Who's Fluttershy?

13:53.700 --> 13:55.333
Oh, did you name your shadow!?

13:55.535 --> 13:58.403
Mine's called Silhouette
Gloom of the Sundown Lands.

13:59.705 --> 14:00.905
Riiiight...

14:01.007 --> 14:04.075
Well, I'm thinking if we just
go talk to the other Kirin,

14:04.277 --> 14:06.511
we can get 'em to welcome
you back proper-like.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.013
Maybe even convince
'em to take your cure!

14:09.315 --> 14:11.116
Oh, Yes, Yes
of course!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.618
Oh.. Just one
small thing.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.586
The antidote from
my anecdote?

14:15.688 --> 14:16.721
It's gone.

14:17.323 --> 14:18.723
There's no cure left!?

14:19.125 --> 14:21.893
I used the last of the Foal's
Breath flowers to make it.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.029
And I haven't seen
them bloom since.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.132
Huh. Well, this wouldn't be a
Friendship Quest if it was easy!

14:29.402 --> 14:32.636
I'm gonna start by gettin' your
friends to welcome you back.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.507
You know? Between you and me,

14:36.709 --> 14:38.909
I'm not sure she's
going to convince them.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.178
"Nope."

14:40.580 --> 14:42.380
But... I hope she does.

14:47.821 --> 14:50.155
[panting] Fluttershy, guess what!

14:50.657 --> 14:52.590
Both: I figured out the
friendship problem!

14:52.792 --> 14:53.558
Me too.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.726
Go ahead.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.496
Bet that's a problem
the Kirin never have.

14:58.598 --> 14:59.664
[giggle] No.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.866
Anyhow, we gotta get
'em all talkin' again.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.701
Oh, no-no-no-no-no!

15:03.803 --> 15:05.771
We can't EVER let that happen!

15:06.073 --> 15:08.740
I thought you said you figured
out the friendship problem!

15:08.942 --> 15:10.608
Was somethin' lost
in translation?

15:13.146 --> 15:15.814
The Kirin are usually
peaceful and kind.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.551
But when they get mad,
they turn into Niriks,

15:19.753 --> 15:22.621
creatures made of
fire and vengeance!

15:23.423 --> 15:26.124
That seemed less scary
when it was in a song.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.994
The last time they all
argued, they got so angry,

15:30.096 --> 15:32.797
they accidentally destroyed
their whole village!

15:32.899 --> 15:34.999
So the Kirin decided
to make sure

15:35.101 --> 15:37.068
it would never happen again.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.537
But that's no reason
to stop talkin'!

15:39.839 --> 15:40.872
Yes it is!

15:40.974 --> 15:42.307
Fire is dangerous.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.743
Especially in a
forest like this!

15:44.845 --> 15:47.078
Think of all the
animals it could hurt!

15:47.380 --> 15:49.514
Not if they don't turn
into fire-breathin' Nirik

15:49.616 --> 15:50.882
in the first place!

15:51.184 --> 15:53.418
And how can you be
sure that won't happen?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.019
There's gotta be
a better way

15:55.121 --> 15:56.788
than givin' up all
your feelings!

15:56.990 --> 15:57.922
APPLEJACK!

15:58.024 --> 15:59.690
You're not LISTENING!

15:59.792 --> 16:02.293
Cause you're not
TALKIN' any sense!

16:03.697 --> 16:05.897
Um, what
are they doing?

16:06.099 --> 16:07.498
Woah! Hey!

16:07.600 --> 16:10.868
Maybe they got worried because
we were arguing with each other.

16:10.970 --> 16:11.903
Aw, shucks.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.273
We were just havin' a
normal, civil disagreement.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.307
Honest!

16:16.609 --> 16:18.209
Where are they taking us!?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.348
To the Stream of Silence!

16:23.450 --> 16:25.716
If we hit that water, we'll
never be able to talk

16:25.818 --> 16:28.286
or FEEL anything ever again!

16:29.556 --> 16:31.189
[evil voice]
PUT THEM DOWN!

16:38.131 --> 16:39.898
It's all right, I
think I know this one.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.066
And she's tryin' to help.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.703
[whoosh] Well, yeah!

16:44.805 --> 16:47.405
Can't have them silence the
only friend who'll speak to me.

16:47.907 --> 16:48.973
She talks!?

16:49.375 --> 16:51.610
You have <i>no </i>idea.

16:51.912 --> 16:54.279
Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.719
Thank you for that,
um, wall of fire.

17:00.821 --> 17:03.855
But.. I thought Niriks were
dangerous when they're angry.

17:03.957 --> 17:06.324
How did you know you could
control your temper?

17:06.826 --> 17:09.794
I didn't. I guess anger's
like other feelings.

17:09.896 --> 17:12.331
It's not about having them,
it's what you do with them.

17:12.733 --> 17:16.835
And giving up happiness to keep
away anger is no kinda life.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.603
I never thought
of it that way.

17:18.705 --> 17:22.508
I can't imagine not being able
to talk to my animal friends.

17:23.270 --> 17:26.204
Fern Flare, you used to
love to laugh at everything.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.547
And Rain Shine, you sung the
most beautiful harmonies.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.682
Don't you miss it?

17:31.684 --> 17:33.518
I know you're worried
about fightin'.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.487
But friends can disagree
without causin' a ruckus.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.656
Every pony gets mad sometimes.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.758
Even Applejack and I argue.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.195
What? When do
we ever argue?

17:43.397 --> 17:45.096
Ahem. On the way here!

17:45.198 --> 17:47.131
And about the
Kirin being silent!

17:47.233 --> 17:48.833
And RIGHT NOW!

17:51.371 --> 17:54.339
[chuckle] We don't
always see eye-to-eye.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.709
But we never let that get in
the way of our friendship.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.279
And if you're really angry,
then take some time away

18:01.381 --> 18:03.915
to be a Nirik where it
won't hurt anypony.

18:08.889 --> 18:10.455
I think they're tryin'
to say somethin'.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.423
OK. Are you hungry?

18:14.027 --> 18:15.594
Oh, no! Somekirin
trapped in a well?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.061
OK, Baby?

18:17.263 --> 18:17.996
Baby fish?

18:18.098 --> 18:19.998
Baby- Baby fish mouth?

18:20.700 --> 18:21.999
Something? Anything?

18:22.135 --> 18:23.368
Ah just write it down!

18:23.470 --> 18:25.136
Ugh! This is making me furious!

18:25.638 --> 18:27.004
Would you excuse me?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.572
I'll be right back.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.809
[roar]

18:33.446 --> 18:34.545
You were saying.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.619
Oh! You want the cure for
the Stream of Silence!

18:43.456 --> 18:44.990
That's wonderful!

18:45.692 --> 18:47.225
Uh, isn't it?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.760
Well, it would be.

18:48.862 --> 18:51.663
Except there aren't any
flowers left to make the cure.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.498
Are you sure?

18:53.700 --> 18:54.966
Oh, beyond sure.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.168
Believe me, I've had a
lot of alone time lately.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.739
I searched the entire forest
seventy three and a half times.

19:01.141 --> 19:05.009
Although I wonder if that second
half could make a difference..

19:07.714 --> 19:11.850
Hm. I wish she'd told us what kind
of flowers she's looking for.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.318
They're called Foal's Breath.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.886
I've never heard of that.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.394
Uh Fluttershy?
A little help?

19:25.398 --> 19:28.166
[gasp] He says he knows where
to find Foals Breath!

19:28.668 --> 19:30.134
Well, what are
we waitin' for?

19:30.336 --> 19:31.335
Lead the way!

19:37.477 --> 19:40.611
[gasp] THAT's what Foal's
Breath looks like!?

19:40.813 --> 19:43.113
Autumn Blaze never would have
made it past the Peaks

19:43.215 --> 19:44.149
to search here!

19:44.951 --> 19:46.285
I owe you an apology.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.286
Why?

19:47.387 --> 19:50.088
'Cause if your kindness hadn't
made you stop to help

19:50.190 --> 19:53.358
the squirrels, we never would've
found this here flower.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.295
And if your honesty hadn't
convinced the Kirin to talk,

19:57.497 --> 19:59.297
we wouldn't NEED to find it.

19:59.799 --> 20:03.300
Heh heh. Guess it's a good
thing the map sent both of us, huh?

20:09.409 --> 20:11.408
[gasp] You found them!
Where were they?

20:11.510 --> 20:12.710
Tell me everything, and
feel free to add

20:12.812 --> 20:14.846
complicated descriptions
and comedic tangents.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.184
Oh, right. First things first.

20:35.935 --> 20:39.971
Autumn Blaze, you
have given us a gift:

20:40.173 --> 20:43.141
the realization that
anger is within us.

20:43.243 --> 20:46.477
But it is our choice
how we let it out.

20:46.779 --> 20:50.448
We would very much like it if
you came back to live with us.

20:50.550 --> 20:54.919
I can't say how much we've
missed your beautiful voice.
