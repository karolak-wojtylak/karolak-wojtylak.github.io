WEBVTT

00:09.099 --> 00:11.965
So, Scootaloo's keeping
Petunia busy like you asked.

00:12.066 --> 00:13.568
What did you two
want to talk about?

00:14.149 --> 00:16.775
I'm sure you get these
questions all the time.

00:17.224 --> 00:19.154
Oh, this is so awkward.

00:20.358 --> 00:23.652
Uh, you're the experts, so we
thought you'd have some insight

00:23.690 --> 00:26.236
into our daughter's
new...uh, cutie mark.

00:26.504 --> 00:27.179
What's wrong?

00:28.003 --> 00:32.344
Obviously, we're both very proud
of her and her cutie mark.

00:32.587 --> 00:35.867
Despite its, um,
unsettling nature.

00:37.666 --> 00:38.643
Unsettling?

00:43.899 --> 00:45.248
I don't get
what you mean.

00:45.467 --> 00:48.386
Her mark doesn't
bother you at all?

00:48.598 --> 00:50.306
Hey! Check out what we found!

00:51.390 --> 00:56.229
Look! A spiny-backed Pon-asaurus
in our own backyard!

00:56.483 --> 00:59.714
And I found them on my
very own. How cool is that?

01:00.361 --> 01:03.888
Oooooh. She's an
archaeologist!

01:04.542 --> 01:08.340
Of course! What did you think
she was gonna be? A pirate?

01:10.466 --> 01:14.184
Pirate! Pfft! Why
would we think that?

01:23.818 --> 01:25.818

By YayPonies
Why "Petunia" has our cutie mark?!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

01:56.212 --> 02:00.330
Whoo-hoo! Another successful
cutie intervention.

02:00.695 --> 02:03.888
You know Crusaders, I don't
want to toot our own horn...

02:04.198 --> 02:06.653
but we've helped a lot of
ponies figure out their

02:06.674 --> 02:07.544
purpose in life.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.005
Like Blue Note, here. Nice
saxophone, Blue Note!

02:13.975 --> 02:15.530
Yep. Everywhere you look,

02:15.700 --> 02:17.975
there's a pony we've
helped find a purpose.

02:23.318 --> 02:26.205
You've gotta admit, we've
had a pretty good effect

02:26.236 --> 02:28.928
on everypony since we
discovered our destiny.

02:29.126 --> 02:31.846
And started helping other
ponies discover theirs!

02:32.083 --> 02:34.146
Could this get any
better or what?

02:35.930 --> 02:39.102
Now, Scootaloo, you do know
there will always be challenges.

02:39.405 --> 02:42.212
Someday, somepony might even
come to us with a problem

02:42.240 --> 02:44.977
that even we can't
handle. Like, say...

02:45.387 --> 02:46.274
...a griffon?

02:46.507 --> 02:51.095
Ha! Exactly. Like a griffon.
But that's just crazy talk.

02:51.342 --> 02:52.504
OR NOT!

02:57.168 --> 02:59.095
Is that really a griffon?

02:59.335 --> 03:00.834
You're durn tootin' it is!

03:01.033 --> 03:02.699
Whaddya think that
griffon wants?

03:03.057 --> 03:05.179
I guess we've gotta
ask her but...

03:05.481 --> 03:08.601
aren't Griffons supposed to
be kind of mean and cranky?

03:09.053 --> 03:11.812
Crusaders, looks like we've
gotta step carefully!

03:15.951 --> 03:17.471
The Cutie Mark Crusaders?

03:17.686 --> 03:19.725
I can't believe it's
really really you!

03:23.408 --> 03:26.257
This... griffon... not cranky!

03:27.147 --> 03:29.857
How in the blooming apples
did you know who we are?

03:30.104 --> 03:32.765
Know who you are?
KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

03:33.478 --> 03:35.944
Why, I've heard about you
from everypony in Ponyville!

03:35.961 --> 03:38.622
I'm so excited to meet
you, I could just EXPLODE!

03:39.412 --> 03:41.436
I'm Gabriella, but
you can call me Gabby,

03:41.453 --> 03:44.003
since we're friends
now. Pleased to meetcha!

03:47.735 --> 03:50.549
Well, howdy, um... Gabby.

03:50.660 --> 03:53.586
OOOOOOH! I'm just
about the most excited

03:53.603 --> 03:56.069
any griffon has ever
been about anything.

03:56.358 --> 03:58.918
Excited? But whatever for?

03:59.269 --> 04:01.293
What for? WHAT FOR?

04:01.499 --> 04:04.546
Everypony in town tells me
of your amazing assistance.

04:04.782 --> 04:07.662
How you help ponies find
their place in the world.

04:08.243 --> 04:09.798
It's a calling. But...

04:09.864 --> 04:12.441
And that's why I'm
here. I need help, too.

04:12.845 --> 04:16.052
I want you to give
me a cutie mark!

04:16.904 --> 04:20.201
Um, can a griffon
even GET a Cutie Mark?

04:20.344 --> 04:23.714
I don't know, but I think we
should probably find out.

04:27.697 --> 04:29.408
So, Gabriella...

04:29.596 --> 04:30.393
Gabby, 'kay?

04:30.730 --> 04:33.843
'Gabby.' Why do you
even want a cutie mark?

04:34.132 --> 04:37.766
It doesn't seem like a very
griffon-y thing to want.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.829
Right? Right? RIIIIIGHT?

04:40.278 --> 04:42.921
You're telling me! I don't
know if you've heard,

04:42.949 --> 04:46.041
but griffons can be a
little bit unfriendly.

04:47.377 --> 04:49.648
<i> Most griffons don't pay much</i>
<i> attention to each other.</i>

04:49.812 --> 04:51.638
<i> And if they do,</i>
<i> it's not, y'know...</i>

04:51.666 --> 04:52.876
<i> the good kind of attention.</i>

04:53.078 --> 04:55.593
<i> As for me, I'm just a little</i>
<i> mail-delivery griffon</i>

04:55.746 --> 04:57.846
<i> who likes to spread a little</i>
<i> bit of griffon-y sunshine</i>

04:57.867 --> 04:59.853
<i> on my rounds! Which</i>
<i> always made me feel</i>

04:59.892 --> 05:01.440
<i> different from the</i>
<i> other griffons.</i>

05:05.871 --> 05:08.640
<i> I'd do anything for any</i>
<i> ol' griffon in need.</i>

05:10.897 --> 05:13.008
<i> But it just always seemed</i>
<i> like the harder I tried,</i>

05:13.255 --> 05:14.299
<i> the less I fit in!</i>

05:14.761 --> 05:16.713
<i> It wasn't until your friends</i>
<i> came to Griffonstone</i>

05:16.904 --> 05:19.050
<i> that I realized some</i>
<i> creatures actually like</i>

05:19.109 --> 05:20.170
<i> helping each other.</i>

05:20.212 --> 05:22.344
<i> And I saw something</i>
<i> so awesomely awesome!</i>

05:22.511 --> 05:25.843
<i> How helping spreads from pony</i>
<i>to pony and griffon to griffon.</i>

05:27.680 --> 05:30.006
<i> I knew then that I had find</i>
<i> out why I was so different</i>

05:30.041 --> 05:31.095
<i> from the other griffons.</i>

05:31.179 --> 05:33.280
<i> And I knew the answer just</i>
<i> HAD to have something to do</i>

05:33.304 --> 05:36.667
<i> with those wonderful, amazing</i>
<i> marks on the ponies' flanks!</i>

05:37.533 --> 05:41.325
<i> And I admit, I became,</i>
<i> maybe, a little obsessed.</i>

05:41.499 --> 05:43.805
<i> So first chance I had to</i>
<i> deliver a letter from Gilda,</i>

05:43.836 --> 05:46.201
<i> I took it so I could</i>
<i> find the perfect ponies</i>

05:46.222 --> 05:48.034
<i> to help me understand</i>
<i> what those marks are.</i>

05:48.911 --> 05:50.866
<i> Everypony here</i>
<i> told me one thing:</i>

05:51.391 --> 05:53.711
<i> I just HAD to see the</i>
<i> cutie mark crusaders.</i>

05:53.954 --> 05:56.292
<i> They've helped everypony</i>
<i> here get their cutie marks.</i>

05:56.448 --> 06:00.403
<i> And I knew, I just knew, that</i>
<i> someday I'd have one, too:</i>

06:00.601 --> 06:03.053
<i> a cutie mark of my very own!</i>

06:04.208 --> 06:05.780
That's why I flew
all the way here.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.686
I want to find my own
place in the world

06:07.766 --> 06:10.911
and I know you can help me
by giving me a cutie mark!

06:11.220 --> 06:13.440
So let's make with
the cutie!

06:14.511 --> 06:15.690
Whenever you're ready!

06:16.521 --> 06:17.600
Did it happen yet?

06:18.504 --> 06:20.354
Uh, not exactly.

06:20.615 --> 06:22.789
How 'bout now? How 'bout now?
How 'bout now? How 'bout now?

06:23.443 --> 06:26.813
Um, Gabby, I hate
to break it to you,

06:26.838 --> 06:29.353
but it sounds like you
mighta heard some tall tales

06:29.373 --> 06:31.238
about what Crusaders can do.

06:31.655 --> 06:34.580
I mean, we are kinda
awesome and all,

06:34.855 --> 06:37.579
but nopony can just
give you a cutie mark.

06:37.843 --> 06:40.420
It just sort of... happens.

06:41.471 --> 06:43.666
Though I'm pretty sure it
doesn't happen to Griffons.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.372
Or if it does, we've
never ever heard of it.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.040
Oh. I hadn't thought of that.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.758
Sounds like a challenge.
And who could be up to it

06:52.782 --> 06:55.151
but the world-famous
Cutie Mark Crusaders?

06:55.478 --> 06:57.213
it's in your name
and everything,

06:57.252 --> 06:58.493
right? Right? RIGHT?

06:59.266 --> 07:01.784
Now I have to deliver Gilda's
letter to Rainbow Dash.

07:01.909 --> 07:03.220
I bet by the time I get back,

07:03.266 --> 07:05.551
you'll have it one-hundred
percent figured out!

07:06.020 --> 07:07.008
Toodles for now.

07:07.874 --> 07:11.099
Wheeeee! Gonna
get my Cutie Mark!

07:11.123 --> 07:14.400
What she wants, it's
not possible, right?

07:14.664 --> 07:18.403
I don't know. But I know
someone who just might!

07:20.229 --> 07:21.819
I've read every
book on the subject.

07:21.843 --> 07:24.020
And I've never read a
thing about any creature

07:24.055 --> 07:25.933
other than a pony
getting a cutie mark!

07:26.125 --> 07:29.356
But Twilight, Gabby flew all the
way here so we could help her.

07:29.582 --> 07:31.433
There's gotta be
something we can do.

07:31.725 --> 07:35.154
Say... is there some kind
of spell you can whip up

07:35.213 --> 07:36.570
to make her mark appear?

07:36.817 --> 07:39.986
Um, I don't know if any of
you remember, but using magic

07:40.017 --> 07:43.092
to get a cutie mark never
really works out all that well.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.935
Ohhhhhh... riiiiight.

07:47.179 --> 07:50.292
Crusaders, I'm sorry. While
I can't say for certain

07:50.320 --> 07:52.963
that it's utterly impossible,
the chances of Gabby

07:53.005 --> 07:56.013
getting an actual mark
are... pretty slim.

07:56.379 --> 07:58.031
Everything I've ever
learned tells me...

07:58.330 --> 07:59.791
it's just not gonna happen.

08:01.001 --> 08:03.012
Oh NO! Poor Gabby!

08:03.280 --> 08:05.241
What the apples are we
ever gonna tell her?

08:10.521 --> 08:12.553
Crusaders, this is terrible!

08:12.883 --> 08:16.820
Gabby really believed in us, and
now we're going to let her down.

08:17.050 --> 08:19.151
But what else can we do?

08:19.516 --> 08:22.459
Hmmm. You know what,
Crusaders? So what.

08:22.744 --> 08:24.723
Maybe we can't help
Gabby get a cutie mark,

08:24.935 --> 08:26.827
but we can still do
what we're best at.

08:27.161 --> 08:29.415
We can help her
find her purpose!

08:29.881 --> 08:32.132
And I reckon doin' that
is the same for Griffons

08:32.170 --> 08:35.704
as it is for ponies... or any
other creature in Equestria!

08:36.132 --> 08:39.429
All we have to do is be extra
special clear with her.

08:39.829 --> 08:42.083
Like, Crystal Empire clear.

08:42.281 --> 08:43.495
Yeah!

08:45.151 --> 08:47.718
INCOMING!

08:52.160 --> 08:54.337
Hiya, you wonderful,
wonderful Crusaders.

08:54.566 --> 08:56.330
I just know you figured
out how to help me

08:56.354 --> 08:57.930
because you're
all so incredible!

08:58.563 --> 09:01.586
Well, Gabby, we've
talked it over

09:01.728 --> 09:04.379
and we think we may just
be able to help you out

09:04.504 --> 09:07.499
but not exactly in
the way you think.

09:07.704 --> 09:10.848
See, here's the thing about
you getting a cutie mark.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.229
I'M GETTING A Cutie
mark! Wooo-whooooo!

09:14.257 --> 09:17.224
Wait, you didn't let me finish!

09:17.280 --> 09:18.420
WHEEEEE!

09:18.598 --> 09:21.746
Um, I think maybe that
could have been clearer.

09:23.356 --> 09:26.608
Cutie mark, cutie mark,
gonna get my cutie mark!

09:26.660 --> 09:29.429
YEAH! Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!

09:29.620 --> 09:33.888
She's still going! Anypony know
if Griffons ever get tired?

09:33.972 --> 09:36.313
What do you think my mark
will be? A lightning bolt?

09:36.406 --> 09:39.711
An erupting volcano?! I don't
care if it's a jar of marmalade.

09:39.864 --> 09:42.361
I know I'll love
it, whatever it is!

09:42.441 --> 09:44.452
Hold on just a hoofstep, Gabby,

09:44.643 --> 09:46.229
there's something
we need to clear up.

09:46.608 --> 09:48.775
We can definitely help
you find your purpose

09:48.800 --> 09:51.572
but that mark's probably
not gonna happen.

09:51.986 --> 09:53.067
WHAT?!

09:53.787 --> 09:56.354
It's true. Twilight's
never heard of a creature

09:56.361 --> 09:58.215
other than a pony
getting a cutie mark.

09:59.255 --> 10:02.841
Oh, pfft, is that all? You
had me worried for a second.

10:03.026 --> 10:05.728
I mean, there's a first
time for everything, right?

10:05.954 --> 10:09.095
And she didn't say it
was impossible, right?

10:09.509 --> 10:11.457
Well, not exactly.

10:11.836 --> 10:14.678
Well, then if anypony can make
it happen, it's you three!

10:14.709 --> 10:16.591
I mean, you haven't failed yet!

10:18.215 --> 10:19.234
You know what, Gabby?

10:19.485 --> 10:22.480
I promise, we're gonna
do everything we can

10:22.511 --> 10:23.662
to help you get your mark!

10:23.780 --> 10:30.041
OH! It's gonna happen! I can
feel it! Whoo hoo! Whoo hoo!

10:30.462 --> 10:31.979
Aaaaand, she's off again.

10:32.270 --> 10:34.386
Why in tarnation would
you promise something

10:34.406 --> 10:36.041
that just can't be done!

10:36.570 --> 10:39.394
I know what it's like to want
something that's out of reach.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.387
And just because it
hasn't happened yet

10:41.676 --> 10:42.740
doesn't mean it can't.

10:43.335 --> 10:45.874
Maybe trying for the
impossible isn't so bad.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.050
I guess we'll never know for
sure unless we give it a try.

10:49.377 --> 10:51.791
All right. But where
do we even start?

10:52.020 --> 10:55.972
Where we always do, with a good
ol' fashioned Crusaders CHART!

10:57.627 --> 11:00.493
The first thing we gotta
do is find your purpose.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.483
No pony gets a mark without one.

11:02.758 --> 11:04.880
All right! Let's do this!

11:05.092 --> 11:07.401
What are you good at?
Do you play any sports?

11:07.488 --> 11:08.671
Or like to dance?

11:08.765 --> 11:13.582
Or how about singing? I just
love to sing. LA LA LA LAAAAAAA!

11:14.194 --> 11:16.744
Wow. I kinda wanna
just try everything.

11:16.796 --> 11:18.671
I mean, I don't even
know what to pick!

11:19.506 --> 11:21.547
Don't worry, that's
what we're here for!

13:38.650 --> 13:40.622
Now how we gonna do THIS?

13:42.090 --> 13:45.360
Gabby's special purpose
can't be everything, right?

13:45.603 --> 13:46.925
It may as well be.

13:47.245 --> 13:49.290
I don't know how we find
what she's supposed to do

13:49.339 --> 13:51.196
when she can do it all.

13:52.361 --> 13:54.904
And if finding her
purpose seems impossible,

13:55.377 --> 13:57.822
we can just forget about
the whole Griffon-getting

13:57.850 --> 14:01.060
-a-cutie-mark thing which
is actually impossible.

14:01.961 --> 14:04.073
I never should have
gotten her hopes up.

14:04.302 --> 14:07.836
I Did. It. All! So? Lay
it on me, Crusaders.

14:07.916 --> 14:09.387
What's my purpose?

14:09.683 --> 14:12.372
And how do we get a mark
on these here haunches?

14:13.923 --> 14:18.226
Gabby, we ... we don't.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.841
Wait! What are you saying?

14:21.126 --> 14:23.516
We're saying that since
you can do everything

14:23.561 --> 14:25.262
so amazingly well...

14:25.763 --> 14:28.747
we just can't figure out what
one thing you're supposed to do.

14:29.784 --> 14:32.726
Gabby. We can't help you.

14:33.116 --> 14:36.149
But-but you're the world-famous
Cutie Mark Crusaders!

14:36.521 --> 14:40.142
I can't believe it. I
- I WON'T believe it.

14:40.507 --> 14:42.000
Gabby! Wait!

14:42.173 --> 14:45.655
We're sorry! We're so, so sorry!

14:46.271 --> 14:47.947
This is just awful!

14:48.153 --> 14:51.325
For the first time ever,
the Cutie Mark Crusaders

14:51.366 --> 14:53.972
are cutie mark... failures!

14:58.459 --> 15:02.653
I'm sorry, Crusaders. I really
thought we could help Gabby.

15:03.008 --> 15:05.102
I thought we could help anypony.

15:05.436 --> 15:08.977
Maybe that's just it. Maybe
we can only help ponies.

15:09.262 --> 15:11.478
Or maybe we just plain failed.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.640
Failed? Then what
do you call THIS?

15:15.906 --> 15:17.645
A CUTIE MARK!?

15:18.820 --> 15:21.206
WHAT? You got your
mark after all!

15:21.321 --> 15:23.120
Even though we couldn't
find your purpose?

15:23.213 --> 15:26.034
But - whaaaa? Huh? HOW?

15:26.222 --> 15:28.730
An' what does it
mean? A cauldron?

15:29.172 --> 15:33.227
Um, I don't know. Maybe
it means my purpose is uh,

15:33.363 --> 15:34.900
helping uh, Zecora with potions.

15:35.081 --> 15:36.591
That's the first thing I tried.

15:36.657 --> 15:40.191
I guess it just took some time
to appear but here it is!

15:40.361 --> 15:44.003
This. Is. AWESOME!
We're not failures.

15:44.121 --> 15:45.561
Whatever we did WORKED!

15:45.690 --> 15:48.389
I had a feeling we could
help you and we did!

15:48.605 --> 15:51.262
Ooh, we've gotta go see
Twilight right away!

15:51.335 --> 15:52.772
She'll want to know about this.

15:53.217 --> 15:55.954
Correction: she NEEDS
to know about this.

15:56.184 --> 15:57.551
I bet she'll want to
write a whole book

15:57.593 --> 16:00.379
about the very first Griffon to
get a cutie mark of her own!

16:00.660 --> 16:05.697
Oh, totally. Um, but you
know Rainbow Dash asked me

16:05.714 --> 16:07.210
to pick up her answer
to Gilda's letter.

16:07.453 --> 16:09.673
I better take care of
that before I forget.

16:09.850 --> 16:12.553
Here's an idea: uh,
you head to the castle,

16:12.587 --> 16:17.888
I'll meet you there, cutie
mark and all. Um.... toodles!

16:18.803 --> 16:20.125
Wow, can you believe it?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.375
We were able to help her
get her mark after all!

16:22.660 --> 16:25.102
Come on, Crusaders;
let's tell Twilight!

16:27.589 --> 16:30.107
Gabby? You just missed her!
She was in such a hurry

16:30.118 --> 16:31.175
she didn't even come in.

16:31.262 --> 16:33.360
Just dropped this
letter and zoomed away.

16:34.466 --> 16:37.474
Dear Crusaders: I'll
never forget you!

16:37.780 --> 16:40.688
You really are every bit
as awesome as I heard.

16:40.859 --> 16:43.853
I'm heading home to
tell all the griffons

16:43.881 --> 16:45.349
how you did the impossible

16:45.377 --> 16:48.747
by getting me my
cutie mark. Toodles!

16:50.626 --> 16:52.939
Wait a second, CUTIE MARK?

16:53.481 --> 16:55.784
You actually got a
griffon a cutie mark

16:55.805 --> 16:57.603
for the first time
in recorded history?

16:57.659 --> 17:01.707
You know what this calls for?
A full-scale research project!

17:02.045 --> 17:03.335
This makes no sense.

17:03.488 --> 17:05.328
Gabby didn't come in
and show you her mark?

17:05.902 --> 17:08.000
You have GOT to get Gabby
back here right away.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.843
I have so many
questions!

17:10.417 --> 17:11.954
I hope I have
enough ink and parchment

17:11.970 --> 17:13.133
to document EVERYTHING!

17:13.175 --> 17:15.836
SPIKE! Guess what just happened!

17:16.020 --> 17:18.848
Weird. Gabby didn't
show Twilight her mark,

17:18.880 --> 17:20.469
like she said she
was gonna do?

17:20.914 --> 17:23.680
Something in this here
applesauce smells kinda fishy.

17:24.017 --> 17:26.135
We better find her and
find out what's going on!

17:26.313 --> 17:27.408
Come on, Crusaders.

17:28.939 --> 17:30.542
Keep your eyes on
the skies, ponies.

17:30.688 --> 17:32.083
Gabby can't have gone far.

17:32.153 --> 17:34.462
She's not in the air,
she's right THERE!

17:34.664 --> 17:37.429
Gabby! Hold up, we're a-comin'!

17:37.895 --> 17:40.994
Um, sorry, no time to chat.
I just stopped to help

17:41.026 --> 17:43.575
this pony get out of the muck
and then I really gotta fly!

17:43.606 --> 17:46.361
OK, HEAVE-HOHHHH!

17:49.283 --> 17:50.838
Gabby, we're your friends!

17:50.911 --> 17:53.568
Why in Equestria you
running away from us?

17:53.655 --> 17:56.660
Running away? Oh,
I'm not running away.

17:56.813 --> 18:00.970
I'm just, um, excited to
show my lovely new cutie mark

18:01.019 --> 18:03.137
to everyone in Griffonstone.

18:03.346 --> 18:06.278
You mean the cutie mark that's
runnin' right off your flank?

18:06.810 --> 18:08.817
Yup. That's the one.

18:09.412 --> 18:11.495
I guess the one thing I'm
really not that good at...

18:11.509 --> 18:13.321
is faking things.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.629
Wow, Gabby, painting
on a fake cutie mark

18:16.657 --> 18:20.233
to make yourself feel better?
You must have been REALLY upset.

18:20.643 --> 18:22.629
Sure, I was disappointed

18:22.744 --> 18:25.801
but I didn't do it to
make myself feel better.

18:26.076 --> 18:28.438
I wanted to make
you feel better!

18:30.215 --> 18:32.452
I couldn't bear you three
thinking you failed

18:32.480 --> 18:34.636
after you tried so
hard to help.

18:34.845 --> 18:37.860
That's why I had to leave before
you or Twilight found out

18:37.888 --> 18:42.059
the truth. I'm sorry
I wasn't honest with you.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.873
I'll just wing my way
back to Griffonstone.

18:45.363 --> 18:46.594
Thanks for trying.

18:47.356 --> 18:49.415
You don't need to
apologize for caring about

18:49.436 --> 18:50.994
how other ponies are feelin'!

18:51.252 --> 18:53.474
I'm just sorry we couldn't
come through for you.

18:53.864 --> 18:57.043
Hmmm... maybe we can.

18:57.276 --> 19:00.212
Gabby, clean up and meet us
at the Crusaders clubhouse!

19:03.586 --> 19:06.493
I know you all tried
your very best,

19:06.873 --> 19:09.954
but I guess griffons and
cutie marks just don't mix.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.426
Maybe I don't even
have a special purpose.

19:13.763 --> 19:16.633
Hang on a second! We
were wracking our brains

19:16.660 --> 19:19.575
trying to figure out your
destiny until we remembered

19:19.634 --> 19:21.826
how every time you
did something new,

19:22.073 --> 19:24.542
you tried to help
everypony around you.

19:24.862 --> 19:26.848
Even us! How did it feel

19:26.862 --> 19:28.633
when you showed up
with that fake mark

19:28.737 --> 19:30.852
and the three of us thought
we'd actually helped you?

19:31.690 --> 19:35.332
Well...I was really glad
I helped you feel happier!

19:35.725 --> 19:38.396
So maybe helping is
your thing.

19:38.747 --> 19:41.276
You might even say
it's your purpose.

19:41.707 --> 19:45.787
But helping just feels good.It
couldn't have anything to do

19:45.801 --> 19:48.723
with what I'm supposed to
do with my life, right?

19:49.311 --> 19:52.212
Gabby, finding your special
purpose doesn't have to be

19:52.226 --> 19:53.791
about being good at something,

19:54.080 --> 19:57.356
it's about feeling good
about something inside.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.036
And it looks like your destiny
is a whole lot like ours:

20:01.332 --> 20:02.441
helping others.

20:02.657 --> 20:05.325
And you don't need a symbol
on your flank to know that!

20:05.537 --> 20:08.539
But since we ARE the
Cutie Mark Crusaders,

20:08.779 --> 20:11.666
we made you one
anyway! Behold!

20:12.629 --> 20:15.019
Your very own cutie mark!

20:15.262 --> 20:16.657
TA DA!

20:17.040 --> 20:19.453
We carved it to mark the
moment we all figured out

20:19.481 --> 20:20.744
what you should
do with your life!

20:21.133 --> 20:25.853
But they look just like
yours? You can't mean...

20:26.403 --> 20:31.366
You bet we do! You're one of us
now! Gabby, today we dub thee...

20:31.711 --> 20:35.513
the very first Griffon member
of the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

20:35.798 --> 20:37.506
WOOHOO!

20:38.257 --> 20:40.779
You may not be able
to get a cutie mark...

20:41.064 --> 20:42.866
...but you're selflessly
dedicatin' your life

20:42.886 --> 20:44.337
to helpin' others anyhow!

20:44.556 --> 20:47.513
I can't think of anything
more Crusadery than that!

20:49.081 --> 20:53.332
AWESOME! My very own cutecinera!

20:54.274 --> 20:56.949
Landsakes, you sure
have earned it!

20:57.140 --> 21:00.549
And so have we. Scootaloo,
you're pretty amazing.

21:00.904 --> 21:02.222
Even though things
looked bleak,

21:02.243 --> 21:04.504
you still found a way to
help Gabby in the end.

21:04.772 --> 21:06.813
'Course! Helping's
what we do, right?

21:07.133 --> 21:11.457
Ooooo, I am SOOOOO grateful!

21:11.773 --> 21:14.118
I'm gonna go home and
do my very very best

21:14.198 --> 21:17.363
to bring Cutie Mark Crusader
values to Griffonstone,

21:17.565 --> 21:19.092
I promise!

21:19.673 --> 21:21.387
Promise us one other thing, too?

21:22.062 --> 21:23.721
COME BACK SOON!

21:24.013 --> 21:27.846
After all, you're a Crusader
now. Crusaders forever?

21:28.111 --> 21:30.313
Crusaders forever!
