00:06.656 --> 00:09.335
This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!

00:09.963 --> 00:11.038
Awesome!

00:12.674 --> 00:16.416
You know, this shower only happens
once every 100 years.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.360
A centennial celebration!

00:19.599 --> 00:20.884
We better get a move on!

00:21.453 --> 00:22.485
Don't wanna be late!

00:26.063 --> 00:26.912
There.

00:27.009 --> 00:28.977
Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?

00:29.526 --> 00:30.089
Check!

00:30.408 --> 00:31.197
Scrolls?

00:31.595 --> 00:32.240
Check!

00:32.539 --> 00:35.453
I've also packed a telescope,
apples, bananas, fruit punch...

00:35.453 --> 00:39.465
...and my freshly baked home-made
triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!

00:40.622 --> 00:41.765
I can see that.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.452
Once again you read my mind, Spike.

00:46.452 --> 00:49.766
And that is why you are my number one assistant.

00:50.124 --> 00:52.545
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

00:52.850 --> 00:56.416
That is why you are my number one assistant.

00:56.608 --> 00:58.213
Missed that! Huh...?

00:58.515 --> 00:59.746
I said...!

01:02.088 --> 01:03.943
Come on, let's get going.

01:04.649 --> 01:06.162
Wait! I almost forgot.

01:06.362 --> 01:09.873
I wanna bring the "Astronomical Astronomer's
Almanac to All Things Astronomy".

01:10.183 --> 01:12.403
The Astronomo-lomo homono what?

01:12.677 --> 01:17.339
You know that really old big blue book
on stars, moons, planets, the Universe...?

01:17.645 --> 01:18.870
Right. Check!

01:37.473 --> 01:40.614
Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?

02:23.410 --> 02:25.795
I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back.

02:25.795 --> 02:28.986
The book would have helped me identify
different planets and stars tonight.

02:29.541 --> 02:32.307
Well... Maybe someone borrowed it?

02:32.507 --> 02:34.723
Besides, you don't need that book.

02:35.004 --> 02:37.908
You can already name
all the planets and stars, cause...

02:37.908 --> 02:39.204
...you're super smart and...

02:39.204 --> 02:40.622
...astronomically awesome!

02:41.214 --> 02:43.563
Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer.

02:43.769 --> 02:45.173
Yeah, I'm a sweet talker.

02:45.507 --> 02:48.060
And a number one assistant, right?

02:48.210 --> 02:48.959
Check!

02:56.779 --> 03:00.029
Wow, Twilight! You're lucky
to have such a rad assistant.

03:00.029 --> 03:02.239
I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them.

03:02.734 --> 03:04.382
Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me!

03:04.382 --> 03:06.506
I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!

03:07.034 --> 03:08.775
Oh yeah, pipsqueak?

03:08.775 --> 03:10.860
How about taking out the trash?

03:11.226 --> 03:12.050
Yes, maâ€™am!

03:13.636 --> 03:16.544
Do we have Spike to thank again
for this amazing spread?

03:16.544 --> 03:18.356
Isn't he simply amazing?

03:18.912 --> 03:20.676
Oh, come on.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.682
I said come on.

03:24.882 --> 03:26.603
Little Spikey-wikey!

03:26.767 --> 03:30.509
Who knew that big ferocious dragon
started off so cutesy wootsy?

03:31.099 --> 03:35.727
Spike, you are such a little star,
that I had to make a little bow tie for you.

03:37.808 --> 03:41.739
Gosh. You guys are embarrassing me. Stop it.

03:42.892 --> 03:44.071
Twilight, your turn.

03:44.316 --> 03:45.740
Spike, that's enough.

03:45.945 --> 03:47.427
All right. That's enough.

03:47.514 --> 03:49.649
Hey, everypony! The show is starting!

04:08.095 --> 04:09.794
Wow...

04:13.154 --> 04:13.884
Huh?

04:30.115 --> 04:32.918
Wow! These cookies are deeleesh!

04:33.157 --> 04:34.288
Spike made them.

04:34.288 --> 04:37.275
Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch?

04:39.274 --> 04:39.882
Spike?

04:43.399 --> 04:45.033
Ooh, poor little thing.

04:45.306 --> 04:47.937
Aww... He's worked himself to the bone.

04:48.137 --> 04:49.601
And now the punch has been...

04:50.146 --> 04:50.984
...spiked!

04:58.105 --> 04:59.378
Goodnight, Spike.

05:03.362 --> 05:05.585
Sweet dreams, number one assistant.

05:11.651 --> 05:12.874
"The Study of Comets."

05:13.135 --> 05:15.373
"Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies..."

05:15.373 --> 05:19.139
"...that are made of non-volatile grains
and frozen gasses. They..."

05:37.547 --> 05:40.250
"...have body structures
that are fragile and diverse..."

05:46.628 --> 05:47.484
Shoot!

05:53.690 --> 05:55.833
Oh... This is a job for Spike.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.222
If only he were awake...

05:57.667 --> 05:58.281
Hoo!

06:03.489 --> 06:05.045
Wait! Don't go!

06:05.045 --> 06:06.175
Don't be afraid.

06:06.910 --> 06:08.826
Thank you for returning my scroll.

06:08.886 --> 06:10.154
Hoo! Hoo!

06:11.614 --> 06:12.472
Uhoo.

06:13.036 --> 06:14.353
Gosh, it's cold tonight.

06:14.713 --> 06:18.142
Say, would you like to relax in here
and keep me company while I work?

06:19.363 --> 06:20.659
Hoo! Hoo!

06:20.847 --> 06:21.990
Now, where was I?

06:22.241 --> 06:26.665
Oh, yes. "...fragile and diverse with
a surrounding cloud of material called a coma..."

06:26.665 --> 06:29.547
"...that grows in size and brightness
as the comet approaches the sun..."

06:36.311 --> 06:37.211
I overslept!

06:37.929 --> 06:39.160
I know it's already ten, but...

06:39.160 --> 06:40.445
...I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed...

06:40.445 --> 06:41.933
...and ready to work twice as fast.

06:41.933 --> 06:43.065
Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight.

06:43.065 --> 06:44.472
And what do you want for breakfast? Oatmeal?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.250
How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes?

06:46.250 --> 06:47.902
Spike, don't worry.

06:47.902 --> 06:49.652
But my morning chores...

06:49.763 --> 06:52.712
It's okay. Owloysius did them for you.

06:53.436 --> 06:54.118
Who?

06:54.157 --> 06:55.966
He's our new junior assistant.

06:56.066 --> 06:59.542
He's gonna help out with your chores
so you won't be so tired all the time.

07:00.029 --> 07:01.312
Wha... Wh...

07:01.312 --> 07:02.942
What do we need a junior assistant for?

07:02.942 --> 07:05.762
I'm not tired. I do fine on my own.
I don't need sleep, I...

07:05.762 --> 07:09.192
Spike, don't worry.
He's just here to help out a little.

07:09.192 --> 07:12.596
Now, I have to go out. So why don't you
introduce yourself to Owloysius?

07:12.696 --> 07:13.999
He's in the library.

07:14.462 --> 07:16.669
Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried.

07:16.786 --> 07:17.574
Who's worried?

07:20.876 --> 07:21.852
Hello?

07:22.389 --> 07:23.575
Hellooo!

07:27.880 --> 07:28.562
Whoa!

07:28.962 --> 07:30.196
Dude, that's creepy.

07:30.878 --> 07:32.252
Uh... Hi there!

07:32.352 --> 07:35.415
I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight
has told you all about me...

07:35.827 --> 07:36.658
Hoo.

07:36.876 --> 07:39.198
Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one?

07:39.198 --> 07:39.981
Hoo?

07:40.653 --> 07:41.955
I'm Spike!

07:42.155 --> 07:44.487
And who are you? And what are you?

07:44.617 --> 07:45.330
Hoo!

07:45.330 --> 07:46.563
-Who?
-Hoo!

07:46.563 --> 07:47.809
I thought your name was Owloysius!

07:47.809 --> 07:48.326
Hoo?

07:48.326 --> 07:51.297
Okay, "Who", "Owloysius", whatever.

07:51.397 --> 07:52.639
I'm Spike, okay?

07:52.939 --> 07:55.498
Look! All you need to know
is that I'm number one...

07:55.498 --> 07:57.276
...and you're number two. Got it?

07:57.276 --> 07:58.059
Hoo?

07:59.609 --> 08:02.819
So, a man of mystery, huh?

08:04.119 --> 08:05.889
I'm keeping my eye on you!

08:06.528 --> 08:08.799
I've got eyes in the back
of my head too, you know?

08:11.846 --> 08:13.285
Well, not really, but...

08:13.285 --> 08:14.530
You know what I mean!

08:16.228 --> 08:18.012
That bird is out for my job.

08:18.046 --> 08:19.451
He wants to be number one.

08:19.937 --> 08:22.438
I'll prove to Twilight that
I deserve to be number one.

08:22.438 --> 08:24.203
Not Freaky Feathers over there.

08:24.530 --> 08:27.899
I won't let him have my job
if it's the last thing I do!

08:35.853 --> 08:39.294
Oh, what a fantastical,
fluffelicious feathery little friend!

08:39.294 --> 08:40.682
I'm... HOOked!

08:44.465 --> 08:46.314
He's just wonderful.

08:46.487 --> 08:48.496
"He's just wonderful."

08:49.438 --> 08:50.844
Uh, yes. Wonderful.

08:50.942 --> 08:51.981
He's quite...

08:52.281 --> 08:53.435
...the charmer.

08:54.198 --> 08:56.583
And Owloysius's just such a star...

08:56.583 --> 08:59.133
...I just had to make this little bow for you.

09:06.636 --> 09:08.480
What's he all saddle sore about?

09:08.480 --> 09:11.122
He's probably just jealous of Owloysius.

09:11.598 --> 09:15.526
Maybe Spike feels threatened
or worried that Owloysius will replace him?

09:15.673 --> 09:18.155
Replace him? Hah! It's crazy!

09:18.155 --> 09:20.555
Spike knows he can't be replaced.

09:20.746 --> 09:22.677
They're trying to replace me!

09:22.677 --> 09:25.612
I better step it up and make sure
that Twilight and Owloysius...

09:25.612 --> 09:27.550
...know that I'm still number one...

09:33.279 --> 09:36.321
Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book
called Two-headed Myth...

09:36.321 --> 09:38.103
...Mythological Mysteries!

09:38.122 --> 09:39.229
I know where it is.

09:43.922 --> 09:45.032
Thanks, Owloysius.

09:45.582 --> 09:46.938
Hey, Spike, no worries.

09:47.038 --> 09:49.102
Owloysius flew up and got the book for me.

09:50.907 --> 09:51.877
Oh, and gee!

09:51.877 --> 09:54.076
I guess I need Ferrets of Fairyland too.

09:55.188 --> 09:56.057
Hey!

09:57.551 --> 09:59.491
Climb down from there before you fall.

10:06.407 --> 10:07.300
Shoot!

10:07.508 --> 10:08.537
Yes, sir!

10:08.753 --> 10:11.003
My last writing quill. It's broken.

10:11.003 --> 10:14.177
Never fear, Spike, your
number one assistant, is here.

10:14.930 --> 10:17.028
Quill... quill... Where is it?

10:17.028 --> 10:18.014
Not here...

10:18.495 --> 10:19.253
Quill...

10:21.708 --> 10:22.804
Quill, where is it...?

10:25.094 --> 10:26.001
Hoo.

10:28.717 --> 10:30.535
Where am I gonna get a quill?

10:32.623 --> 10:34.803
Spike, wait! Wait!

10:36.873 --> 10:40.024
But the store is called "Quills and Sofas".

10:40.024 --> 10:42.102
You only sell two things!

10:42.102 --> 10:44.884
Sorry, Junior. All outta quills until Monday.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.516
Need sofa?

10:48.674 --> 10:50.913
I swore I had one here somewhere.

10:51.242 --> 10:52.483
Ah, here it is!

10:52.558 --> 10:53.635
A quince!

10:53.635 --> 10:55.558
Not a quince. A quill!

10:55.669 --> 10:57.422
Right. A quail?

10:58.780 --> 10:59.680
A quilt!

11:00.054 --> 11:01.259
A quesadilla?

11:02.367 --> 11:03.127
Aha!

11:03.287 --> 11:04.753
A quiche!

11:04.753 --> 11:07.262
Not a quiche. A quill!

11:07.314 --> 11:09.766
Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.

11:10.736 --> 11:11.506
Shoot.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.116
Come on, chicken!

11:16.116 --> 11:17.243
Here, chicky chicky chicky!

11:17.428 --> 11:18.764
Here, chick chick chick chicky!

11:19.007 --> 11:19.973
Come here!

11:24.860 --> 11:25.798
Come here!

11:39.240 --> 11:39.874
Spike...

11:40.569 --> 11:42.284
...to the rescue.

11:42.944 --> 11:44.219
Oh, Spike.

11:44.377 --> 11:47.310
I was calling out for you when you were
turning this place upside down.

11:47.310 --> 11:50.086
Owloysius gave me one of
his feathers to use as a quill.

11:54.679 --> 11:56.150
That's just great.

11:56.270 --> 11:57.034
Perfect!

11:57.239 --> 11:58.074
Sweet!

11:58.627 --> 11:59.926
I think I'll just, uh...

12:00.102 --> 12:01.664
...finish up the rest of my chores!

12:01.664 --> 12:03.947
Or did Owloysius already do them?

12:03.947 --> 12:06.526
Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them.

12:06.866 --> 12:09.663
Well, that's fine. Because I can just
stay up all night and finish...

12:13.744 --> 12:14.902
Poor Spike.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.542
He'll come around.

12:16.781 --> 12:19.446
He's genuinely a good little guy.

12:25.238 --> 12:27.725
Spike. What is this?

12:27.841 --> 12:29.563
You said this book was missing.

12:29.563 --> 12:32.076
Well, Owloysius found it right where it belongs...

12:32.076 --> 12:33.470
...but like this.

12:33.615 --> 12:35.117
How did it get this way?

12:35.117 --> 12:37.213
Uh... Well, um...

12:37.393 --> 12:38.394
You see, I...

12:38.911 --> 12:41.884
I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh...

12:42.649 --> 12:44.065
Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?

12:44.422 --> 12:45.965
I've seen a dragon lie.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.381
I'm very disappointed in you, Spike.

12:52.073 --> 12:53.178
You set me up!

12:53.401 --> 12:55.489
Well, two can play that game.

12:55.711 --> 12:56.472
Hoo!

12:56.596 --> 12:58.747
Not "who"! Two!

13:01.512 --> 13:04.662
Owloysius is out to take my place. I just know it!

13:04.862 --> 13:06.276
I've gotta stop him.

13:06.618 --> 13:07.738
But how?

13:13.611 --> 13:14.829
Ah...

13:26.686 --> 13:27.614
Come along, Opal.

13:27.614 --> 13:29.882
Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.

13:48.075 --> 13:50.038
So lifelike.

13:50.613 --> 13:53.894
And when Twilight discovers it
shredded up on her floor...

13:53.894 --> 13:57.277
...she'll think mouse-eating Owloysius is to blame.

13:57.277 --> 13:59.587
And I'll be number one...

14:00.032 --> 14:01.284
...again!

14:44.843 --> 14:47.075
That poor little field mouse!

14:47.275 --> 14:48.947
Torn to pieces!

14:49.285 --> 14:51.627
It must have been Owloysius!

14:51.827 --> 14:53.867
You know, since owls eat, you know, mice.

14:53.967 --> 14:56.706
What a terrible, terrible bird!

14:56.706 --> 14:58.102
He must be punished!

14:58.505 --> 14:59.153
Right?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.663
Spike! I don't know what upsets me more.

15:02.663 --> 15:05.223
That you deliberately tried to set up Owloysius...

15:05.223 --> 15:08.101
...or that you actually thought
this pathetic attempt would work!

15:08.497 --> 15:11.047
You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike.

15:11.047 --> 15:12.944
I am truly disappointed.

15:12.944 --> 15:16.048
This is NOT the Spike I know and love.

15:22.991 --> 15:23.670
She...

15:24.350 --> 15:26.562
She doesn't love me anymore.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.431
Twilight hates me.

15:31.801 --> 15:35.928
I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely.

15:36.422 --> 15:37.844
Could it get any worse?

15:42.338 --> 15:43.708
I guess that's a yes.

15:50.970 --> 15:51.929
Hello?

15:53.627 --> 15:54.976
Hello!

16:00.367 --> 16:02.146
What is that?

16:09.943 --> 16:11.833
If this is what running away is all about...

16:11.833 --> 16:13.237
...I never wanna go home!

16:14.700 --> 16:16.627
Gems! Mmm... Woohoo!

16:22.463 --> 16:24.080
Even if my tummy's full...

16:24.403 --> 16:26.226
...the rest of me is still empty.

16:26.921 --> 16:29.188
I miss Twilight and the pony gang.

16:29.580 --> 16:31.657
But she doesn't love me anymore.

16:32.169 --> 16:33.987
So, I'm better off here.

16:34.442 --> 16:35.988
All by myself.

16:38.147 --> 16:40.376
Wow. Seems to be getting warmer.

16:42.363 --> 16:44.198
The steam is great for my complexion...

16:44.329 --> 16:46.402
...but it's sure getting hot in here.

16:50.666 --> 16:53.696
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY CAVE?

16:53.696 --> 16:57.280
AND WHY ARE YOU EATING MY GEMS?

16:58.998 --> 16:59.937
Heyah bro!

17:00.209 --> 17:01.907
I didn't know this was your cave.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.704
And I didn't know these were your gems, but...

17:04.041 --> 17:05.026
...we're cool, right?

17:05.026 --> 17:06.029
Whoa, whoa!

17:06.133 --> 17:08.536
Hey... We're like brothers, you know?

17:08.854 --> 17:11.176
I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon...

17:11.276 --> 17:12.797
It's us against the world, right?

17:16.597 --> 17:17.783
You don't scare me!

17:18.081 --> 17:19.003
So you're big.

17:20.572 --> 17:21.780
Really big.

17:23.789 --> 17:25.614
And your claws are super sharp.

17:25.951 --> 17:26.713
Tail...

17:27.775 --> 17:29.239
...extra spiky.

17:29.617 --> 17:30.358
But, uh...

17:30.441 --> 17:32.442
You don't scare me! Ha!

17:34.264 --> 17:35.627
How'd you like that?

17:40.941 --> 17:41.533
Uh...

17:41.635 --> 17:43.376
I'd love to stay, but gotta go!

17:43.381 --> 17:44.941
See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!

18:04.364 --> 18:05.722
Uhoo!

18:20.882 --> 18:22.522
Spike! Over here!

18:26.601 --> 18:28.170
Am I glad to see you!

18:28.266 --> 18:29.910
Hurry! Hop on!

18:38.717 --> 18:40.942
It's too dark! I can't see!

18:41.690 --> 18:42.967
Hoo. Hoohoo!

19:07.228 --> 19:09.840
Spike. We were so worried about you.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.593
*I* was so worried about you.

19:11.593 --> 19:13.224
Why did you run away?

19:13.648 --> 19:15.724
I thought you didn't need me anymore.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.967
And that you didn't love me anymore.

19:18.955 --> 19:21.805
Spike. Sure, I was disappointed...

19:21.805 --> 19:23.988
...but you are my number one assistant!

19:23.988 --> 19:25.344
And friend.

19:25.344 --> 19:27.097
And you always will be.

19:27.097 --> 19:29.902
It's just that sometimes I need some help at night.

19:30.254 --> 19:32.216
I can't ask you to stay up late.

19:32.216 --> 19:35.113
You're a baby dragon and you need your rest.

19:35.113 --> 19:38.982
Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owloysius to help.

19:38.982 --> 19:40.878
But not to take your place.

19:42.027 --> 19:44.289
No one could ever replace you, Spike.

19:44.439 --> 19:47.322
Not even when you are being a jealous numskull.

19:48.196 --> 19:49.542
I'm sorry, Twilight.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.430
I've never should have been so jealous.

19:52.197 --> 19:53.916
And I'm sorry too, Spike.

19:54.116 --> 19:55.739
I should have been more sensitive.

19:56.956 --> 19:58.273
And Owloysius...

19:58.899 --> 20:01.518
I know now that you weren't out to take my job.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.014
Forgive me?

20:03.286 --> 20:03.938
Hoo?

20:04.499 --> 20:06.116
Me. Forgive me, Spike.

20:06.388 --> 20:07.054
Hoo!

20:10.850 --> 20:12.570
He forgives you, Spike.

20:12.701 --> 20:15.406
Hey! How did you guys know where I was?

20:15.587 --> 20:17.436
It was your ketchup covered feet.

20:17.436 --> 20:21.120
Owloysius discovered your footprints and
we followed them all the way to the cave.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.291
Oh yeah, the ketchup.

20:22.391 --> 20:23.969
It looked pretty real though, didn't it?

20:26.356 --> 20:27.005
Uh...

20:30.872 --> 20:34.239
I know Princess Celestia will wanna
read about what happened today...

20:34.391 --> 20:35.576
I'm ready when you are.

20:37.595 --> 20:40.550
Hey, Spike. Why don't you
write to Princess Celestia?

20:40.550 --> 20:42.430
And tell her what you've learned?

20:42.635 --> 20:43.547
Really?

20:43.741 --> 20:45.927
Why, that's a big responsibility!

20:46.263 --> 20:47.093
I know.

20:47.291 --> 20:49.942
But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.

20:50.088 --> 20:51.975
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:52.167 --> 20:55.013
"This is Spike, writing to you
about my adventures."

20:55.218 --> 20:57.685
"This week I've learned that being jealous..."

20:57.910 --> 21:00.536
"...and telling lies gets you nowhere in friendship."

21:01.743 --> 21:05.860
"I also learned that there's plenty of love
for every friend to share."

21:06.043 --> 21:09.364
"So from here on out,
I promise, that I, Spike, will..."

21:16.152 --> 21:17.531
Oh, Spike.

21:17.854 --> 21:18.509
Hoo?

21:19.428 --> 21:21.669
Who? Spike! You kno...

21:21.824 --> 21:23.308
Oooooh...

21:29.232 --> 21:32.732
