00:04.571 --> 00:06.305
Hey there, my
unicorn friend.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.473
Have you heard?

00:07.575 --> 00:09.775
About Princess Twilight
Sparkle's coronation?

00:09.877 --> 00:10.776
Who hasn't!

00:10.878 --> 00:13.312
I'm on my way there now. So
much baking to do and...

00:13.414 --> 00:16.582
No, no, about the
Earth ponies.

00:16.984 --> 00:20.019
I know their crops have
been underperforming, but...

00:20.121 --> 00:20.953
That's not it.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.289
They're HOARDING the
food for themselves!

00:23.691 --> 00:25.224
I heard the Mayor
of Appleoosa say

00:25.326 --> 00:27.459
that if unicorns and
pegasi want to eat,

00:27.561 --> 00:30.029
they can use their
OWN hooves to dig.

00:30.131 --> 00:30.996
How awful!

00:31.098 --> 00:33.999
We unicorns have to
stick together, right?

00:42.309 --> 00:44.243
Ah, Chrysalis.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.613
<i>Another</i> successful
field trip, I presume?

00:47.715 --> 00:50.716
Spreading distrust among the
unicorns and earth ponies

00:50.818 --> 00:52.952
is almost TOO easy.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.820
We could take down
Twilight and her friends

00:54.922 --> 00:56.688
a hundred times,
but as long as

00:56.790 --> 00:59.258
they have the "love" of
Equestria behind them,

00:59.360 --> 01:03.128
they'd crawl back to
defeat us. Not anymore!

01:03.230 --> 01:05.531
No friendship,
no magic!

01:05.633 --> 01:07.867
It's SO obvious when
you think about it.

01:07.969 --> 01:10.269
I did my part freaking
out the pegasi!

01:10.371 --> 01:14.006
And Grogar's long absence
has given ME time to prepare

01:14.108 --> 01:15.907
the next part
of our plan.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.613
Grogar's Bell!

01:21.815 --> 01:25.284
This artifact can steal
ANY creature's magic.

01:25.386 --> 01:31.023
It holds that magic until
it is released by THIS spell.

01:31.625 --> 01:37.596
Which means.. all the power
inside is OURS for the taking!

01:39.033 --> 01:40.232
You're drooling
on the bell.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.169
Let's try the spell
<i>before</i> Grogar gets back.

01:44.371 --> 01:47.506
I'm sick of waiting for that
old goat's "master plan."

01:48.475 --> 01:49.741
Take my hands.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.279
So we can all be
part of the spell!

01:54.481 --> 01:58.884
Unless you'd prefer I
take all the magic myself?

01:59.887 --> 02:03.522
Our pact stands. What
we do, we do together.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.058
Once we defeat the
protectors of Equestria,

02:06.160 --> 02:11.163
we can claim this land and rule
our kingdoms, ALONE once more.

09:55.496 --> 09:57.496

Why wait until now for
such a horrible plan?

10:21.021 --> 10:24.155
You don't take a final exam

10:24.257 --> 10:27.659
Just think, after
defeating THREE baddies,

10:27.761 --> 10:29.928
Twilight would
HAVE to believe

10:30.030 --> 10:33.231
that she's the leader
we all know she is!

10:33.433 --> 10:37.302
You have made a grave
misjudgment, Discord..

10:37.504 --> 10:40.905
Do you have anything ELSE
you would like to tell us?

10:41.107 --> 10:44.008

news or the bad news?

10:44.110 --> 10:46.044

11:03.864 --> 11:05.797
Compared to me
losing my powers,

11:05.899 --> 11:08.299

11:22.950 --> 11:26.584
Oh! Just listen to my voice
and use your imagination.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.401
Have I mentioned how
great revenge is?

11:43.503 --> 11:47.506
I hope you got a name picked
out for your future kingdom.

11:47.608 --> 11:50.609
Because it's time to
destroy Equestria!

11:55.015 --> 11:59.718
They're probably on their way
to attack Canterlot.. right now!

11:59.820 --> 12:01.586
Then we'll stop 'em!

12:01.688 --> 12:05.056
HOW? Stopping Sombra by
himself was hard enough!

12:05.158 --> 12:07.558
And that was with lord-of-
chaos training wheels!

12:08.228 --> 12:11.095
Twilight, it doesn't
matter if Discord set up

12:11.197 --> 12:12.931
your successes or not.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.668
WE believe in you..
and always have.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.604
