WEBVTT

00:03.287 --> 00:08.930
OK. Library... library... Where
did they put the library?

00:14.290 --> 00:17.498
This Castle looked a lot
smaller from the outside.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.755
Morning, Starlight.

00:22.880 --> 00:23.701
Whoops!

00:23.861 --> 00:27.810
Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still
trying to find my way around.

00:28.021 --> 00:30.596
You don't happen to know
where the library is, do you?

00:31.185 --> 00:32.174
Next door on the left.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.527
Oh. Thanks.

00:36.072 --> 00:39.236
Acceptance, mm-hmm,
Altruism, definitely.

00:39.934 --> 00:41.941
Starlight! Good
morning! Come in!

00:42.145 --> 00:44.552
Sorry I'm late. I got
a little turned around.

00:44.916 --> 00:47.520
I still can't believe you're
letting me stay here.

00:47.840 --> 00:51.025
As your pupil. After
everything I did.

00:52.123 --> 00:55.170
Well, I'm not one to dwell on
the past and neither should you.

00:55.381 --> 00:59.083
The castle is your home now and
as far as being my pupil goes...

00:59.258 --> 01:00.552
I was just trying to figure out

01:00.574 --> 01:02.414
what your first friendship
lesson should be!

01:02.625 --> 01:05.520
Oh. Well, it looks like you're
really narrowing it down.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.040
Oh, these are just the As. After
this, I move on to the Bs!

01:20.414 --> 01:25.410

01:53.789 --> 01:55.629
I know I'm just learning
about friendship,

01:55.643 --> 01:58.727
but I didn't think there were
this many lessons for anything.

01:58.996 --> 02:00.305
How do we choose?

02:00.538 --> 02:03.163
Maybe I should pare things down
a bit before we go through them.

02:04.152 --> 02:05.920
Why don't you join the
others in the throne room?

02:06.036 --> 02:07.912
They're planning our trip
to the Crystal Empire

02:07.934 --> 02:10.763
when Shining Armor and Princess
Cadance have their baby.

02:10.952 --> 02:12.247
Throne room. Got it!

02:14.785 --> 02:17.003
Um, which way is
the throne room?

02:19.752 --> 02:21.803
Well, I think we should leave ASAP!

02:21.854 --> 02:23.294
I don't want to miss
the Crystalling!

02:23.694 --> 02:26.530
But, um, shouldn't we
wait for the invitation?

02:26.894 --> 02:29.418
Frankly, I'm not exactly
clear on all the customs

02:29.432 --> 02:31.243
and traditions of
the Crystal Empire.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.505
Especially when it
comes to a Crystalling.

02:33.709 --> 02:34.981
What's a Crystalling?

02:35.192 --> 02:37.301
Well, that's just
it, Darling.

02:37.570 --> 02:40.530
Princess Cadance and Shining
Armor's baby is due any day

02:40.872 --> 02:42.429
and we're still not sure.

02:42.669 --> 02:45.730
The Crystal Empire was
gone for a thousand years.

02:46.043 --> 02:48.589
A lot of their customs
are a bit murky.

02:48.981 --> 02:51.280
We know it's got something
to do with the new baby.

02:51.469 --> 02:52.283
And a party!

02:52.770 --> 02:53.905
And the Crystal Heart.

02:54.218 --> 02:55.054
And a party!

02:55.250 --> 02:57.207
And some kind of cool energy.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.480
And...

02:58.770 --> 03:00.152
A PARTY!

03:02.603 --> 03:04.472
It's not hard
to understand.

03:04.712 --> 03:06.909
Most things in the
Crystal Empire aren't.

03:07.992 --> 03:11.032
Like how I'm a big hero
there, for example.

03:17.549 --> 03:18.705
Plus, I've had to help Twilight

03:18.727 --> 03:20.261
do a lot of research
on Crystallings.

03:21.745 --> 03:23.890
Whenever a baby is born
in the Crystal Empire,

03:24.101 --> 03:26.181
the parents bring it
before the Crystal Heart.

03:26.698 --> 03:29.047
They get the purest shard
of crystal they can find,

03:29.069 --> 03:31.505
then pick a Crystaller
to present the baby

03:31.527 --> 03:33.141
to everypony who comes.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.247
Then they all share the
light and joy they feel,

03:36.429 --> 03:38.785
feeding it into the crystal
that joins with the Heart

03:38.967 --> 03:40.603
and increases its power.

03:41.643 --> 03:43.600
And this is going to
be a Royal Crystalling,

03:43.730 --> 03:45.941
so pretty much the whole
Empire will show up.

03:46.174 --> 03:47.978
That hasn't happened
in a millennia.

03:49.258 --> 03:52.203
What do you mean it increases
the Crystal Heart's power?

03:52.334 --> 03:55.112
The energy it uses to protect
the Crystal Empire, I guess.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.829
Protect it from what?

03:57.095 --> 03:59.452
I didn't help Twilight
with that part.

04:07.427 --> 04:09.612
Hey, Twilight, can
I ask you something

04:09.630 --> 04:10.738
about the Crystal Empire?

04:11.126 --> 04:13.083
Ha! Funny you
should mention it...

04:13.280 --> 04:15.335
Because I just narrowed your
first friendship lesson

04:15.353 --> 04:16.387
down to three options.

04:16.652 --> 04:18.670
And one of them is in
the Crystal Empire.

04:18.818 --> 04:19.852
Really?

04:20.621 --> 04:22.227
I found out that's
where the first pony

04:22.246 --> 04:23.520
you ever cared about lives!

04:23.772 --> 04:24.941
Sunburst?

04:25.138 --> 04:26.978
Of course that's just one idea.

04:27.144 --> 04:28.603
We could also go to
Griffinstone.

04:28.627 --> 04:31.470
Making friends with a Griffin
is a challenge all by itself.

04:31.766 --> 04:33.507
Or we could tag
along with the CMCs

04:33.550 --> 04:35.286
the next time they help a
pony who can't figure out

04:37.347 --> 04:39.864
Starlight, is something wrong?

04:39.987 --> 04:43.612
What? Oh, no. Those
all sound great.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.563
I know! I guess you
were right.

04:45.649 --> 04:47.581
It is going to be
hard to choose one.

04:49.950 --> 04:50.990
Yeah.

05:03.569 --> 05:06.867
Ugh! I am never going to find
my way around this place!

05:07.556 --> 05:09.040
Gee, Starlight, what's wrong?

05:09.390 --> 05:10.720
I don't know, Spike.

05:10.904 --> 05:13.612
Twilight's figuring out what
my first friendship lesson is

05:13.630 --> 05:17.064
and I guess I'm not exactly
thrilled with the options.

05:17.575 --> 05:19.544
Well, with one of them.

05:20.006 --> 05:20.609
Which one?

05:21.255 --> 05:23.864
Reuniting me with
my first friend.

05:24.529 --> 05:26.160
What's so terrible about that?

05:31.212 --> 05:32.455
When we were foals,

05:32.473 --> 05:35.636
Sunburst knew everything there
was to know about magic.

05:45.489 --> 05:47.476
He always knew just what to do.

05:55.907 --> 05:58.418
And he was always
there to help me.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.556
I guess it's not surprising that
Sunburst got his cutie mark

06:11.587 --> 06:15.230
in magic and went off to
Princess Celestia's school.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.169
But when he left...

06:17.741 --> 06:19.643
You blamed cutie marks and
stripped a whole village

06:19.661 --> 06:21.249
of theirs and when Twilight
and the others stopped you,

06:21.267 --> 06:23.341
you went back in time and
almost destroyed Equestria.

06:25.156 --> 06:28.289
Not really stuff I'm super
eager to tell Sunburst about.

06:28.584 --> 06:32.209
I mean, he's probably some
big, important wizard now

06:32.246 --> 06:36.006
and I can't even find my way
around Twilight's Castle.

06:36.289 --> 06:38.781
Well, if Sunburst is
that good at magic,

06:38.880 --> 06:42.036
maybe he'd appreciate
your exploits.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.298
You should talk to
Twilight about it.

06:45.513 --> 06:47.735
I'm sure she'd want to
hear what you have to say.

06:47.913 --> 06:51.624
I know, but I don't want her to
think I'm not ready to learn

06:51.815 --> 06:54.535
or that I'm not grateful
for everything she's doing.

06:54.701 --> 06:56.363
SPIKE! COME QUICK!

07:07.163 --> 07:08.916
It's a Crystalling invitation!

07:09.101 --> 07:12.443
Shining Armor's a
father! I'm an Aunt!

07:13.280 --> 07:14.584
Well, this settles it.

07:14.787 --> 07:16.603
Since we're going to
the Crystal Empire,

07:16.627 --> 07:18.886
your first friendship
lesson is going to be

07:19.366 --> 07:21.341
reuniting with Sunburst!

07:22.480 --> 07:23.538
Great.

07:41.692 --> 07:44.523
Um, Applejack, what is that?

07:44.744 --> 07:46.849
Oh, just a little
something for the young'un.

07:48.209 --> 07:51.212
Made from genuine Sweet
Apple Acres apple trees.

07:51.630 --> 07:52.966
We make 'em for all the Apples

07:53.187 --> 07:56.338
and anypony related to Twilight
is practically family.

07:57.476 --> 08:03.427
Yeah. It's OK, but it's no
Cloudsdale Mobile...BAM!

08:03.876 --> 08:06.092
Oooh! Pretty!

08:08.252 --> 08:10.701
Well, a mobile is real nice...

08:10.880 --> 08:14.012
as long as you have something to
lay in so you can look at it.

08:14.289 --> 08:17.144
And a fetching blanket
to keep you warm.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.110
I'm sure Shining Armor
and Princess Cadance

08:20.135 --> 08:22.898
will love all our gifts, but
I think they're more happy

08:22.910 --> 08:24.892
we'll be attending the
baby's Crystalling.

08:25.107 --> 08:27.550
Ooh! I can't wait to see
all that light and love

08:27.575 --> 08:30.504
make the Crystal Heart even
more sparkly and shiny!

08:30.750 --> 08:32.676
Actually, Pinkie,
the Crystal Heart

08:32.695 --> 08:34.652
is an ancient and
powerful relic.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.996
Without its magic, the
Crystal Empire would be lost

08:37.015 --> 08:37.981
to the Frozen North.

08:38.301 --> 08:42.289
Wow. This Crystalling
sounds pretty important.

08:42.707 --> 08:45.883
I'd understand if you
wanted to, you know,

08:46.049 --> 08:48.676
wait to do a different
friendship lesson

08:48.695 --> 08:49.846
when we get back.

08:50.221 --> 08:52.449
Are you kidding?
This trip is perfect.

08:52.690 --> 08:55.698
Not only do I get to see the
baby and take part in a ceremony

08:55.723 --> 08:57.895
that helps maintain the
magic of the Crystal Empire,

08:58.098 --> 08:59.870
but I'm starting
my new pupil off

08:59.895 --> 09:03.581
with the most amazing friendship
lesson ever. I can't wait!

09:04.867 --> 09:07.526
Right. Me neither.

09:11.083 --> 09:14.283
Actually, Twilight,
I am a little worried

09:14.301 --> 09:15.760
about meeting Sunburst.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.292
Oh, trust me, I know what
it's like to see old friends,

09:19.476 --> 09:21.360
but I'll be right there
to help things along.

09:21.563 --> 09:24.129
I've broken the whole lesson
down into a few easy steps

09:24.147 --> 09:26.707
to ensure this reunion
goes off without a hitch.

09:34.916 --> 09:37.735
Step one, head to Sunburst's
house and get you two started

09:37.753 --> 09:38.775
on the right hoof.

09:38.929 --> 09:42.166
Step two, get to the Castle with
enough time to visit the baby.

09:42.996 --> 09:44.535
Shining Armor!

09:44.880 --> 09:46.424
Twilight!

09:46.996 --> 09:48.547
I didn't know you
were meeting us.

09:48.972 --> 09:52.578
Of course I am. It's me.
Right here. Here I am.

09:52.590 --> 09:54.609
Why wouldn't I come
meet my sister?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.584
Though we have met before.

09:57.458 --> 09:58.480
Are you all right?

09:58.775 --> 10:02.098
Never better! Being a father
is amazing and wonderful

10:02.123 --> 10:05.384
and amazing and
confusing and amazing...

10:05.458 --> 10:07.261
But surprising too, you know?

10:07.587 --> 10:11.126
I mean, not that you'd know. You
wouldn't know, I know. You know?

10:13.120 --> 10:16.443
Sorry. I haven't really slept
since Cadence had the baby.

10:17.101 --> 10:19.680
Come to think of it,
she hasn't either.

10:20.043 --> 10:21.858
It sure would be
great to get a break.

10:22.196 --> 10:25.489
Oh. Of course. I don't
know what I was thinking.

10:25.796 --> 10:27.735
You two probably need
all kinds of help!

10:28.135 --> 10:30.584
I'm sorry, Starlight,
but I guess combining

10:30.609 --> 10:33.495
your first lesson with this
visit wasn't such a good idea.

10:33.950 --> 10:37.827
Oh, don't be ridiculous!
You're an aunt now.

10:38.043 --> 10:41.907
That's way more important
than some friendship lesson.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.566
I just wish there
was a way to do both.

10:46.178 --> 10:48.381
Maybe there is.

10:48.566 --> 10:50.375
You've already done the
work for Starlight's lesson

10:50.393 --> 10:51.310
with this list.

10:51.513 --> 10:53.126
All we have to do is follow it.

10:54.024 --> 10:56.080
Spike, you're a genius!

10:56.443 --> 10:59.396
Yeah. Genius.

11:00.012 --> 11:00.775
Then it's settled.

11:00.978 --> 11:03.249
Shining Armor and I will
head straight to the castle

11:03.470 --> 11:05.575
and you two can head
straight to Sunburst's.

11:05.790 --> 11:06.966
Aye, aye, princess.

11:11.150 --> 11:12.609
All right, big brother.

11:12.836 --> 11:15.384
Let's go see this
amazing baby pony.

11:22.110 --> 11:24.172
I know you're a little
worried about this reunion,

11:24.301 --> 11:26.609
but I'm sure Twilight's
got everything covered.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.867
Everything except how I'd rather
do absolutely anything else.

11:31.489 --> 11:33.458
I bet she's taken
that into account too.

11:33.753 --> 11:37.784
It's all part of the
lesson. Trust the lesson.

11:38.135 --> 11:39.353
Right.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.661
Hey, is that you?

11:46.100 --> 11:48.400
Oh. Yep. It sure is.

11:48.849 --> 11:51.649
Now... according to the
list, Sunburst's house is--

11:51.667 --> 11:54.461
Why is there a statue of
you in the Crystal Empire?

11:54.855 --> 11:57.310
Because Spike, the
brave and glorious,

11:57.347 --> 11:59.563
saved all of us
from King Sombra.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.252
And then again during
the Equestria Games.

12:02.418 --> 12:03.304
Really?

12:03.409 --> 12:05.181
Really! Big fan.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.880
Um, when were you going
to tell me about this?

12:09.243 --> 12:11.421
Oh, it's no big deal.

12:11.495 --> 12:13.686
IT MOST CERTAINLY IS!

12:15.021 --> 12:16.073
That's it.

12:16.584 --> 12:19.753
We're not going anywhere
until I get the whole story.

12:24.701 --> 12:28.492
Before we go in, I should
probably tell you,

12:28.806 --> 12:31.821
seeing the baby might
be a bit of a shock.

12:32.150 --> 12:34.861
Come on, big brother,
I've met babies before.

12:35.095 --> 12:37.704
I expect meeting this one
won't be any different.

12:45.470 --> 12:47.618
Of course, I could be wrong.

12:52.910 --> 12:55.833
iiiiiaaa, ahhh, GNAGRN

12:55.883 --> 12:57.212
The baby is an Alicorn?

12:58.049 --> 12:59.987
It looks that way.

13:00.067 --> 13:00.695
But! but!

13:01.052 --> 13:03.150
But I thought Alicorn
wings had to be earned

13:03.175 --> 13:06.436
by accomplishing some great
princess-worthy deed.

13:06.683 --> 13:09.230
Yeah, how can you just
be born with them?

13:09.476 --> 13:10.769
The birth of an Alicorn

13:10.790 --> 13:13.224
is something Equestria
has never seen.

13:13.507 --> 13:15.815
It is beyond even
our understanding.

13:16.203 --> 13:18.190
That's not very reassuring.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.652
Wow, a unicorn and a Pegasus!

13:20.756 --> 13:24.738
So, she could be a super strong
flyer and have crazy baby magic.

13:25.310 --> 13:28.080
Well, I know all about
super strong flying.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.480
And I can help keep
tabs on her magic.

13:43.569 --> 13:46.018
It appears her magic
is more powerful

13:46.036 --> 13:47.809
than that of a newborn unicorn.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.969
The crowds have already
started to gather.

13:52.467 --> 13:55.095
This Crystalling is
gonna be some party!

13:56.849 --> 13:59.046
Do you think we
should call it off?

13:59.390 --> 14:03.200
Um, we've all faced a lot
worse than baby magic.

14:03.649 --> 14:04.898
I can't imagine cancelling

14:04.916 --> 14:06.867
such a beautiful and
important ceremony

14:07.089 --> 14:09.544
over something so
potentially adorable.

14:09.624 --> 14:12.080
Yeah! Of course! Come on!

14:12.498 --> 14:14.566
In light of the little
one's abilities,

14:14.695 --> 14:17.409
this Crystalling might be
more important than ever.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.753
Perhaps you should
address your subjects

14:19.778 --> 14:21.021
and remind them of that.

14:29.981 --> 14:32.012
Shining Armor, do you
have everything you need

14:32.043 --> 14:32.984
for the ceremony?

14:33.913 --> 14:37.913
Huh? Oh! NO! I still have to
interview the Honor Guards,

14:37.940 --> 14:40.609
chose the Purity Crystal
and pick a Crystaller!

14:42.430 --> 14:44.043
All right. Take it easy.

14:44.246 --> 14:46.683
Pinkie can stay here with me
and keep an eye on the baby.

14:48.756 --> 14:51.747
And we'll all help you
with everything else.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.633
That is if you can stay awake
long enough to tell us how.

15:00.258 --> 15:01.907
And that's how we found
the Crystal Heart,

15:02.049 --> 15:04.775
defeated King Sombra
and saved the Empire.

15:04.935 --> 15:07.876
Yay! We love you, Spike! Yeah!

15:08.018 --> 15:10.572
Tell the one about
the Equestria Games!

15:10.892 --> 15:14.381
Well, as much as I love
reliving my heroic deeds,

15:14.547 --> 15:16.713
Starlight and I have an
important lesson to do

15:16.861 --> 15:18.898
by order of the
Princess of Friendship.

15:19.132 --> 15:20.646
AWWWWW!

15:20.929 --> 15:24.430
Oh, come on, Spike. I want to
hear about the Games, too.

15:25.655 --> 15:27.581
I know you're nervous
about seeing Sunburst,

15:27.852 --> 15:29.680
but it says right
in step three to,

15:30.092 --> 15:33.513
"deal with your fears by facing
them," not by putting it off.

15:34.824 --> 15:37.544
Ugh. Let's go get
this over with.

15:44.264 --> 15:45.255
Wait!

15:45.421 --> 15:46.049
What?

15:46.276 --> 15:48.596
Knocking on the door isn't
the next thing on the list.

15:48.916 --> 15:49.913
Seriously?

15:50.221 --> 15:52.172
I know Twilight can
be a little nitpicky,

15:52.258 --> 15:54.043
but this is your first
lesson as her pupil

15:54.180 --> 15:56.055
and it's important
that we do it right.

15:57.175 --> 16:00.036
Fine. What's the next
thing on the list?

16:01.360 --> 16:04.363
"Before they see each other,
make sure to highlight

16:04.387 --> 16:05.827
the importance of the meeting."

16:06.116 --> 16:08.430
I'm pretty sure
we can skip that.

16:08.690 --> 16:09.690
I don't know!

16:09.926 --> 16:12.153
I mean, if we skip it, the
whole lesson could go south.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.486
And then you might end up
taking a giant step backwards

16:14.504 --> 16:15.513
instead of forwards.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.243
Maybe you'll never be
able to learn anything

16:17.267 --> 16:18.510
about friendship at all.

16:19.464 --> 16:22.676
It's almost like your whole
future depends on this moment.

16:24.073 --> 16:26.400
"Highlight the importance
of the meeting." Check.

16:26.781 --> 16:28.640
I can't believe you
wanted to skip that.

16:42.289 --> 16:43.723
Sunburst?

16:44.073 --> 16:46.080
Yes? What can I do for you?

16:46.393 --> 16:49.630
It's, it's me. Starlight.

16:49.938 --> 16:52.061
We used to be friends?

16:53.938 --> 16:59.163
Oh, of course! Starlight. My
goodness, it's been a long time.

16:59.692 --> 17:01.993
What, what have
you been up to?

17:02.424 --> 17:07.587
Me? Oh, you know, some
of this, some of that.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.080
Different stuff.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.747
Right now I'm sort of,
Twilight Sparkle's new pupil.

17:14.006 --> 17:16.006
The Princess of Friendship?

17:16.381 --> 17:20.596
Heh. Yeah. That's actually
kind of why I'm here.

17:20.824 --> 17:23.833
I mean, I know you're
probably very busy.

17:23.963 --> 17:24.867
What do you mean?

17:25.489 --> 17:27.636
Well, I figured
after Magic School,

17:27.655 --> 17:30.258
you'd go on to do important
wizard work, but...

17:30.843 --> 17:35.723
Oh. No. Yes. Oh yes, that's
me. Yep. Important wizard.

17:35.876 --> 17:39.513
Really busy with lots of,
uh... wizarding stuff.

17:41.710 --> 17:44.787
Right, well Good to see you.

17:46.627 --> 17:48.547
Huh. Maybe we
should have skipped

17:48.560 --> 17:50.929
"highlighting the importance
of the meeting" after all.

17:51.587 --> 17:53.353
Well? I guess that's that!

17:53.470 --> 17:55.335
Starlight, come on!

17:55.593 --> 17:57.944
We have to at least explain
what Twilight wants!

17:58.633 --> 17:59.667
Ugh.

18:07.175 --> 18:11.723
Dearest Citizens, I am sure
you are all just as thrilled

18:11.747 --> 18:15.889
and ready for this Crystalling
as myself and Shining Armor.

18:21.076 --> 18:23.901
I'm not ready!

18:24.006 --> 18:25.187
Take it easy.

18:25.273 --> 18:28.418
Just pick whoever looks the
most like Honor Guard material.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.326
Right. Right!

18:34.221 --> 18:35.298
I'm sorry;

18:35.581 --> 18:38.732
fatherhood is way more
stressful than I ever thought.

18:38.923 --> 18:40.756
I can only imagine.

18:41.021 --> 18:43.686
Now, I know choosing
the crystal of purity

18:43.704 --> 18:45.433
is a very important decision,

18:45.643 --> 18:48.350
so I have gone through the
trouble of arranging them

18:48.375 --> 18:52.018
in order from incredibly
pure to outrageously pure.

18:52.455 --> 18:56.080
Um, Rarity? Don't they
all sort of look the same?

18:56.227 --> 18:58.849
Oh well, to the
untrained eye, perhaps.

18:59.255 --> 19:01.390
What do you think,
Shining Armor?

19:03.556 --> 19:04.873
I DON'T KNOW!

19:06.406 --> 19:07.944
I hope Twilight and Pinkie

19:07.969 --> 19:09.790
are having better
luck with the baby.

19:11.380 --> 19:14.670
Well, at least she's having fun!

19:22.855 --> 19:24.326
Pinkie, hold her still!

19:24.516 --> 19:27.403
I'm trying!

19:34.732 --> 19:40.110
So, the Princess of
Friendship wants you and I

19:40.135 --> 19:41.501
to be friends again?

19:42.670 --> 19:45.384
I know. Weird, right?

19:46.153 --> 19:47.243
I don't understand.

19:47.446 --> 19:50.590
Did something happen to you
after I left for Magic School?

19:50.836 --> 19:54.510
What? No! I don't see what
that has to do with anything.

19:55.046 --> 19:56.449
Why would you even ask that?

19:58.609 --> 20:01.889
I mean, did something
happen to you

20:01.907 --> 20:03.723
after you left for magic school?

20:03.852 --> 20:10.424
What? Um. No. Like you said,
I'm a important wizard.

20:12.990 --> 20:14.670
I'm sure there's something
on Twilight's list

20:14.695 --> 20:15.612
that can help here.

20:24.676 --> 20:27.790
OK. I chose the Honor Guard,
picked the Purity Crystal

20:27.840 --> 20:30.756
and I know exactly who I
want to be our Crystaller.

20:30.892 --> 20:32.824
So, all we need is...

20:34.350 --> 20:35.353
The baby?

20:36.560 --> 20:37.600
We're here!

20:38.726 --> 20:41.353
She's a really strong flyer!

21:12.615 --> 21:15.716
I'm guessing that's gonna make
it hard to do the Crystalling.

21:16.092 --> 21:17.212
It's worse than that...

21:17.723 --> 21:20.646
Without the Heart, the Crystal
Empire is about to be buried

21:20.664 --> 21:22.461
under a mountain
of ice and snow!
