00:01.867 --> 00:05.971
<i>Please put your hooves together</i>
<i>  for your next performer...</i>

00:06.073 --> 00:07.773
<i> Maud Pie!</i>

00:11.580 --> 00:15.748
What do you call an Alicorn
with no wings and no horn?

00:17.351 --> 00:18.551
"Earth Pony."

00:18.653 --> 00:21.052
[Pinkie Pie shrieks
with laughter]

00:22.356 --> 00:26.192
But seriously, being an
Earth Pony isn't so bad.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.494
We've got magic powers, too.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.462
Like walking around...

00:30.764 --> 00:33.032
and picking stuff
up with our teeth.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.603
That's sarcasm by the way.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.810
It's funny cause it's true!

00:47.214 --> 00:50.182
My favorite thing to
listen to is clastic rock.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.085
The accumulation of sediments
over millennia forming

00:53.187 --> 00:56.422
to create sandstone,
shale and breccia.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.991
It sounds something
like this.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.165
And that's my time.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.200
Pinkie: Hahahahaha!

01:08.302 --> 01:10.702
Isn't my sister Maud the
most hilarious, entertaining,

01:10.804 --> 01:13.272
AMAZING comedian ever?

02:05.326 --> 02:05.959
Your jokes!

02:06.060 --> 02:06.993
Your hilarious delivery!

02:07.094 --> 02:09.327
Your.. your EVERYTHING!

02:09.730 --> 02:13.132
How was my... timing?

02:13.534 --> 02:14.900
Ha! You got me!

02:15.002 --> 02:17.336
C'mon! Let's celebrate,
sister style!

02:17.438 --> 02:20.506
We could get matching stickers
that say "Eyes on the Pies!"

02:20.608 --> 02:22.841
then show them off at the
Ponyville Sticker Convention

02:22.943 --> 02:25.611
that I could plan for
tomorrow if you want?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.813
Actually, I'm
busy tonight.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.015
Aw, that's what
you said yesterday.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.851
And the day before that.

02:32.053 --> 02:34.554
And the day before
the day before that!

02:35.356 --> 02:38.557
[sigh] It's just, we haven't hung
out in a really long time

02:38.659 --> 02:40.392
because you always
have other plans,

02:40.494 --> 02:44.195
even when you promised to build
whip cream pyramids with me.

02:46.200 --> 02:50.602
I know. I am sorry, Pinkie. The
reason is I have a--

02:50.704 --> 02:52.271
Apology accepted.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.206
As long as we get some
serious sister time

02:54.308 --> 02:55.358
before your birthday.

02:55.459 --> 02:57.409
And there's uh,
definitely no reason

02:57.511 --> 02:59.278
I want to hang out
before your birthday.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.548
Just, you know, not
planning anything special.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.183
OK.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.651
What about
tomorrow morning?

03:06.253 --> 03:07.218
OK.

03:07.620 --> 03:08.220
Yay!

03:08.322 --> 03:09.239
Just you and me!

03:09.340 --> 03:11.957
Best Sister
Friends Forever!

03:12.659 --> 03:15.361
Best Sister
Friends Forever.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.596
I can't wait for
tomorrow to be today!

03:17.698 --> 03:21.900
Eeeeeeeee!

03:22.002 --> 03:23.435
Tomorrow is today!

03:23.737 --> 03:27.206
Who's ready for some fun
times at Sugarcube Corner?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.408
The answer is YOU!

03:30.010 --> 03:31.544
I would also accept "Maud."

03:32.546 --> 03:33.279
Maud?

03:34.648 --> 03:35.547
MAUD?

03:39.019 --> 03:40.786
[gasp] Oh, I get it!

03:40.888 --> 03:42.721
We're playing hide
and go seek!

04:22.629 --> 04:24.863
Ah-HA! Found you!

04:38.178 --> 04:39.434
Where's Maud?

04:39.535 --> 04:40.991
I've already checked
Discord's dimension,

04:41.092 --> 04:43.548
Granny Smith's wax
museum, AND Yakyakistan!

04:43.750 --> 04:45.384
She HAS to be here!

04:45.586 --> 04:49.021
Nope, it's just me, reading.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.793
Story checks out..

04:54.895 --> 04:55.895
OR DOES IT?

04:56.797 --> 04:57.563
It does.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.566
But are you sure
there's nopony hiding...

05:00.968 --> 05:02.334
IN YOUR CLOSET?

05:04.972 --> 05:07.138
Pinkie...I don't
have a closet.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.507
Is everything OK?

05:08.809 --> 05:11.009
No. I was supposed to go
birthday cake shopping

05:11.111 --> 05:12.644
with Maud today.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.646
And ruin her
surprise party?

05:14.948 --> 05:17.449
I wasn't going to
tell her why, silly!

05:17.551 --> 05:19.384
But now I can't
even find Maud.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.121
I'm usually way better at
hide and seek than this.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.422
Oh, she probably just found
a new rock formation

05:24.524 --> 05:26.091
and forgot you two
were gonna hang out.

05:26.393 --> 05:28.326
Tell you what, you
take care of the cake,

05:28.428 --> 05:29.461
and I'll look for Maud.

05:30.363 --> 05:30.929
Really?

05:31.031 --> 05:31.997
Thanks, Starlight!

05:34.801 --> 05:35.735
Just checking.

05:41.408 --> 05:44.977
I've got to get very important
ingredients for a very important

05:45.079 --> 05:49.047
pony's cake, and it's gotta be
tippy-top-super-duper-secret.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.983
Technically... it's
not your turn yet.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.452
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.120
Didn't mean to cut
in front of anypony.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.693
Um, whatcha doin'?

06:01.095 --> 06:04.429
I am currently speaking to a
pony at a baking supply shop

06:04.531 --> 06:06.999
two minutes before it
closes for lunch.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.201
Riiiiight.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.636
OK..?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.505
It's just that I'm trying
to plan a party here,

06:13.607 --> 06:15.374
and the clock is
ticking while you, uh...

06:15.676 --> 06:17.309
What are you doing, anyway?

06:17.811 --> 06:19.878
I am currently
speaking to--

06:19.980 --> 06:22.314
I mean, can I help
you move this along?

06:22.416 --> 06:23.348
What are you looking for?

06:23.850 --> 06:24.800
Rolling pins? Cupcake tins?

06:24.901 --> 06:26.051
Cookie cutters with
tails and fins?

06:28.455 --> 06:29.454
Goodbye.

06:31.292 --> 06:33.993
THAT'S what you've been standing
here all this time to say?

06:34.295 --> 06:39.065
I was deciding between
"goodbye" and "see you later."

06:39.167 --> 06:41.767
Uh...but...they're
the same thing!

06:41.969 --> 06:44.503
Technically?
They're very different.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.772
"See you later" implies an
event in the near future

06:47.874 --> 06:49.908
wherin we see each other.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.244
"Goodbye" expresses good
wishes where parting

06:53.346 --> 06:55.447
or at the end of
a conversation.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.948
Yeah. Same thing.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.085
I will not apologize for
speaking with precision.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.021
In that case,
apology not accepted!

07:03.223 --> 07:04.489
Goodbye-later-seeya-same thing!

07:05.175 --> 07:07.158
Ah! Can you believe that guy?

07:07.560 --> 07:08.161
Huh?

07:09.663 --> 07:10.795
"Out to lunch?"

07:10.897 --> 07:12.097
Oh, come on!

07:12.599 --> 07:16.201
Ugh. No Maud, no cake, no anything!

07:16.603 --> 07:18.670
And how annoying was that pony?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.038
Who takes that long
to say goodbye?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.540
Or was it "see you later?"

07:21.642 --> 07:23.675
UGH, now he's got me doing it!

07:25.378 --> 07:26.878
Hello, Pinkie Pie.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.113
MAUD!

07:28.215 --> 07:28.880
Found you!

07:28.982 --> 07:30.081
My turn to hide!

07:31.385 --> 07:33.552
I'm sorry I wasn't
around this morning.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.221
Oh, psh, what are you
apologizing to me for?

07:36.323 --> 07:38.623
I'm not upset, you silly willy.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.792
The reason is I
met somepony--

07:40.894 --> 07:41.994
Want to hang
out right now?

07:42.095 --> 07:43.595
I mean, I can see you're
not doing anything

07:43.697 --> 07:44.698
with anypony else.

07:44.799 --> 07:49.100
Unless they're invisible
or really small.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.020
Pinkie.

07:50.121 --> 07:53.539
The reason I've been so busy
is that I have a boyfriend now.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.507
A WHA?

07:55.809 --> 07:56.875
A boyfriend.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.977
A WHAAAAAA?

07:59.279 --> 08:00.312
A boyfriend.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.781
A WHAAAAAA?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.283
A boyfriend.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.151
That's so exciting!

08:06.253 --> 08:07.252
MY sister!

08:07.354 --> 08:08.954
IN LOVE!

08:09.256 --> 08:12.023
Technically, we're
"in like."

08:12.125 --> 08:13.958
Tell me EVERYTHING!

08:14.677 --> 08:16.193
Who is he? What's
his favorite color?

08:16.396 --> 08:17.246
Does he like ice cream?

08:17.347 --> 08:19.197
If he were a bird, what
kind of bird would he be?

08:19.400 --> 08:21.367
Wait. Is he
actually a bird?

08:21.468 --> 08:23.835
Oh! I don't know because you
haven't told me anything yet!

08:24.838 --> 08:25.904
You'll like him.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.039
We have a lot in common.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.874
Well, I love you,

08:29.976 --> 08:31.910
so I know I'm going to
love your boyfriend!

08:32.012 --> 08:34.613
Oh! I can't wait
to meet him!

08:35.015 --> 08:36.414
You don't have to.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.419
He's a rock!

08:40.521 --> 08:43.222
And you love rocks,
so it's perfect!

08:43.624 --> 08:45.690
[gasp] Is Boulder jealous?

08:46.092 --> 08:48.026
No, behind the rock.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.529
Mudbriar, are you back there?

08:51.331 --> 08:53.599
Technically?
Not anymore.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.934
[gasp] WHA WHA WHAAAAA?

09:01.408 --> 09:04.776
Pinkie Pie,
meet Mudbriar.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.677
Technically?

09:05.779 --> 09:07.079
We've already met.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.047
You...?

09:09.349 --> 09:09.981
Yes.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.616
You?

09:11.918 --> 09:12.517
Yes.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.885
You.

09:14.187 --> 09:14.920
Yes.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.988
I mean... haha, you!

09:18.391 --> 09:20.359
You! You! You!

09:20.761 --> 09:23.162
Yes. Yes. Yes.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.931
I'm sorry, let's
start over.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.767
Hi! I'm Maud's
sister, Pinkie Pie.

09:29.669 --> 09:30.470
I know.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.039
So...

09:34.241 --> 09:35.340
How did...

09:35.742 --> 09:37.476
You two meet?

09:38.378 --> 09:39.611
At a rock show.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.646
Oh, you're into
rocks too?

09:41.848 --> 09:44.349
No. I like sticks.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.152
Then why were you
at a rock show?

09:47.354 --> 09:50.855
It was a petrified wood show,
which technically

09:50.957 --> 09:52.624
makes it a stick show.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.093
Except that in the
permineralization process

09:55.195 --> 09:58.563
of petrification, all organic
material is replaced with

09:58.665 --> 10:01.500
silicates, i.e. rocks--

10:01.602 --> 10:05.236
--while retaining the original
structural elements of wood.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.840
Q.E.D. It was a stick show.

10:08.642 --> 10:11.409
I'm... really
into sticks too!

10:11.511 --> 10:13.945
They're great for
hitting piñatas!

10:14.047 --> 10:15.313
Aaahhh!

10:16.483 --> 10:17.649
Pinkie!

10:18.251 --> 10:20.018
Oh, you
wanna go first?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.220
That is stick abuse.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.254
It is?

10:24.791 --> 10:25.925
I'm sorry.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.460
Oh, this is awful, I am not
being a very good sister.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.412
Let's start over.

10:30.513 --> 10:32.863
I'm Pinkie Pie,
nice to meet you.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.332
Technically?

10:34.434 --> 10:35.967
We've already met.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.903
You should introduce
Pinkie to your pet.

10:40.105 --> 10:40.772
Oh!

10:40.974 --> 10:42.440
Your pet likes fetch!

10:42.642 --> 10:44.375
This<i> is</i> my pet.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.244
So no.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.449
Aw. Look at Twiggy and
Boulder playing together.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.152
They're adorable.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.287
It's just a stick.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.789
Don't be rude.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.325
Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

11:00.627 --> 11:01.760
One more time...

11:02.062 --> 11:04.896
I'm Pinkie Pie,
nice to meet you.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.464
Technically?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.033
We've already met.

11:15.742 --> 11:16.575
AHHHH!

11:16.676 --> 11:17.909
I don't get this guy!

11:19.246 --> 11:21.079
Wow! Maud has a boyfriend?

11:21.381 --> 11:22.647
Agh!

11:22.749 --> 11:24.482
How can she like
someone so weird?

11:26.887 --> 11:29.221
He has an inanimate
object for a pet!

11:29.923 --> 11:30.873
So does Maud.

11:31.174 --> 11:32.924
Boulder has TEN times
the personality

11:33.026 --> 11:35.093
of some random stick.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.195
Mudbriar too, for that matter.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.364
He's not like Maud AT ALL.

11:40.066 --> 11:43.335
Maud is hilarious, friendly,
caring, and easy to talk to!

11:44.037 --> 11:45.437
Yup, that's Maud.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.874
But this guy is awkward,
quiet, and kind of...

11:49.676 --> 11:50.609
strange!

11:50.711 --> 11:53.478
Uh, that also
sounds like Maud.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.047
Hah! You're so
funny, Starlight!

11:56.149 --> 11:57.767
Maud is nothing
like Mudbriar.

11:57.868 --> 12:00.986
If she were, then we wouldn't
be best sister friends forever.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.189
Well, Maud obviously
likes something about him.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.727
Maybe you just need to
spend more time with him,

12:08.829 --> 12:10.161
find out what you
have in common.

12:10.663 --> 12:11.462
That's easy.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.263
Nothing!

12:13.800 --> 12:15.567
You both care
about Maud.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.303
I know! He could help
you with her party!

12:19.005 --> 12:20.238
I guess...

12:20.440 --> 12:22.874
And I'll keep Maud busy
while you and Mudbriar

12:22.976 --> 12:25.177
plan the best surprise
birthday ever!

12:25.879 --> 12:27.646
That, I can do.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.183
Listen. Maud's
birthday is tomorrow

12:32.285 --> 12:33.885
and there's no
time to waste.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.587
You're not afraid
of slides, are you?

12:35.789 --> 12:38.289
No, wh-aaaahhhhhhhh!

12:39.192 --> 12:40.024
No reason!

12:40.226 --> 12:41.726
Weeeeee!

12:47.801 --> 12:51.002
Welcome to my PARTY
PLANNING CAVE!

12:52.605 --> 12:53.539
Technically?

12:53.640 --> 12:56.274
Due to the speleothems
growing from the ceiling,

12:56.376 --> 12:58.810
this is more of a
cavern than a cave.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.412
Maud taught me that.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.013
Yeah OK.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.818
Here's what I'm thinking for
her surprise party:

13:06.920 --> 13:09.420
edible rock candy plates,
gem-shaped ice cubes,

13:09.522 --> 13:10.755
a pebble piñata--

13:11.425 --> 13:13.191
--uh, we'll skip that one.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.494
Might I make some
suggestions?

13:16.896 --> 13:18.830
Oh, suggest away!

13:19.032 --> 13:20.365
That's why you're here.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.168
You and me,
planning... together.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.770
Friends.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.540
I have a vision board of
everything Maud loves,

13:28.742 --> 13:31.142
and none of those
things are on it.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.077
Hm.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.446
Let me see this "vision board."

13:34.848 --> 13:36.347
It's not a physical thing.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.685
I'm envisioning it.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.054
I enter through the large
door of my mind palace

13:43.156 --> 13:45.356
and enter to the back where
I have all of my books

13:45.458 --> 13:48.660
and possessions and what do I
encounter, The Maud Room.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.930
None of those things are there.

13:52.632 --> 13:53.932
Just as I thought.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.034
Maud doesn't like surprises.

13:57.871 --> 13:58.870
Where does it say that?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.439
She never told me that!

14:00.641 --> 14:03.942
Mm. It sounds like she was
protecting your feelings.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.144
She's very caring that way.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.447
Stop acting like you know
my sister better than me!

14:09.849 --> 14:11.849
Technically, I never said that.

14:13.353 --> 14:17.222
Well, technically,
I don't care!

14:17.324 --> 14:19.290
And since I've been best sister
friends forever with Maud

14:19.392 --> 14:22.694
my entire life, I think
I'M the expert here!

14:22.896 --> 14:26.097
Oh, but fine. If you don't
believe me, let's ASK HER.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.399
BUT WE HAVE TO BE SUPER SNEAKY!

14:28.601 --> 14:30.335
Can you be more specific?

14:30.537 --> 14:31.470
NO!

14:37.510 --> 14:40.613
Huh! You must
be Mudbriar!

14:41.815 --> 14:43.748
I'm Starlight Glimmer,
nice to meet you!

14:43.950 --> 14:45.584
I've heard great things.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.854
I'm so glad the two of you
are spending time together!

14:50.156 --> 14:52.958
So, how's it.. going?

14:53.960 --> 14:57.162
Mudbriar and I have just spent
the BEST time bonding

14:57.264 --> 14:58.930
and we're really starting
to make some headway

14:59.032 --> 15:01.499
becoming besties, except
for one teensy weensy

15:01.601 --> 15:03.701
disagreement that maybe
you could settle, Maud.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.603
See, Mudbriar here
seems to think

15:05.705 --> 15:08.406
that you don't like
surprise parties.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.409
Isn't it funny how
WRONG HE IS?

15:11.311 --> 15:13.078
I like surprise parties...

15:13.490 --> 15:14.490
Hmm?

15:15.315 --> 15:16.948
...because I know they
make you happy

15:17.050 --> 15:18.483
when you throw
them for me.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.018
See?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.071
WAIT, WHAT?

15:21.472 --> 15:25.123
I'd rather just do something
small with you, Starlight,

15:25.225 --> 15:28.326
Boulder, and Mudbriar
for my birthday.

15:28.928 --> 15:29.928
No party?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.596
NO. PARTY?

15:32.198 --> 15:33.832
Did he put you
up to this?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.300
Mm mm.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.602
Maybe you should
consider, I don't know,

15:37.704 --> 15:40.071
taking things a little
less serious with Mudbriar,

15:40.173 --> 15:42.073
because he's kinda, sorta...

15:42.275 --> 15:44.008
IMPOSSIBLE TO LIKE.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.178
Hey, Mudbriar!

15:47.280 --> 15:49.180
Have you ever flown a kite?

15:49.482 --> 15:51.048
Lemme tell you
all about it, see,

15:51.150 --> 15:52.984
the first thing
you should do is...

15:53.086 --> 15:55.286
I just can't believe you would
choose sitting around with him

15:55.388 --> 15:57.622
over a party with
your own sister.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.425
I didn't "choose" either of you.

16:00.927 --> 16:01.827
Technically?

16:01.928 --> 16:03.828
I said I wanted to
be with both of you.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.464
TECHNICALLY!?

16:06.566 --> 16:08.867
UGH! You even like
the way he TALKS?

16:09.569 --> 16:11.902
Everything about
him makes me happy.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.057
Then I guess you don't need

16:15.158 --> 16:17.475
a best sister friend
forever forever anymore.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.946
Pinkie...

16:21.648 --> 16:25.083
Wait, let's all slow down
and talk about this--

16:25.185 --> 16:29.385
No! [blubbering]

16:30.923 --> 16:32.623
See you later!

16:38.031 --> 16:39.397
I don't understand!

16:39.499 --> 16:41.600
How could Maud like Mudbriar?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.702
Is it opposite day?

16:44.204 --> 16:46.104
Nothing makes sense!

16:46.706 --> 16:48.239
<i> I'm not shy! </i>

16:48.441 --> 16:50.541
<i>  And I hate animals. </i>

16:51.043 --> 16:52.176
<i> Fashion? </i>

16:52.378 --> 16:54.445
<i> Not for me, Darling. </i>

16:54.747 --> 16:59.617
<i> Pthew, an apple a day
is downright disgusting. </i>

16:59.819 --> 17:04.188
<i> Slow and steady wins the race. </i>

17:04.290 --> 17:06.257
<i> I never learned to read! </i>

17:10.663 --> 17:12.864
WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE CUPCAKES?

17:24.410 --> 17:25.310
Good morning!

17:25.912 --> 17:28.346
Oh, wait... bad morning.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.617
GET OUTTA BED, SIS!

17:32.819 --> 17:34.719
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
HERE, YOU GOTTA WORK!

17:35.921 --> 17:36.954
Oh.

17:40.510 --> 17:42.794
You're probably wondering why I
came back to the family farm

17:42.896 --> 17:44.529
in the middle
of the night.

17:44.931 --> 17:45.764
Mmm-hmm.

17:45.966 --> 17:47.532
Well, it all
started when--

17:47.634 --> 17:49.600
Less talking,
more farming!

17:50.002 --> 17:50.719
Mmmmm.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.237
It's just... Maud
has a boyfriend.

17:53.940 --> 17:54.939
I'm not jealous.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.641
Who said anything about jealous?

17:57.143 --> 17:57.843
Don't be!

17:57.944 --> 17:59.644
He's super-duper weird!

17:59.746 --> 18:01.913
And somehow he tricked
Maud into liking him.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.048
And now I'll never get
to see her again.

18:05.819 --> 18:08.352
I came home because you two
know her better than anypony.

18:08.454 --> 18:09.487
What am I missing?

18:09.589 --> 18:10.655
What does she see in him?

18:10.857 --> 18:13.257
What does he have that I don't!?

18:16.129 --> 18:17.329
Buck up, Pinkie Pie!

18:17.430 --> 18:20.430
You look as miserable
as I feel all the time.

18:22.569 --> 18:26.204
It's just.. that I love Maud
and I WANT to love Mudbriar,

18:26.306 --> 18:29.740
but I can't see anything
to LIKE about him!

18:32.645 --> 18:33.878
Ugh, fine.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.246
We're taking a work break.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.114
C'mon.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.919
I'm looking at a sparkling
bright blue and white rock.

18:42.021 --> 18:42.688
See it?

18:43.890 --> 18:45.890
You mean that lumpy gray one?

18:45.992 --> 18:48.894
No, the beautiful blue and
white one, right there.

18:50.196 --> 18:53.397
I would not describe that as
beautiful, blue, or white,

18:53.499 --> 18:55.834
but... heh heh, OK!

18:56.436 --> 18:57.236
Show her.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.173
It's a geode.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.142
The outside looks
like a regular rock,

19:04.244 --> 19:06.678
but the inside is filled
with beautiful gems.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.779
So you're saying...

19:08.881 --> 19:11.515
I should crack open
Mudbriar like a rock!

19:11.917 --> 19:13.718
IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.553
No wait, it doesn't.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.889
It's a METAPHOR, Pinkie!

19:18.291 --> 19:21.392
You see Mudbriar as a rock,
but Maud sees him as a gem.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.528
Even if you never see
past his dullness,

19:23.630 --> 19:25.964
you CAN see how
happy he makes Maud.

19:26.066 --> 19:28.199
And to a sister, that's
all that matters.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.300
Mmm-hmm!

19:33.673 --> 19:36.641
Oh, Limestone,
Marble, thank you.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.776
I don't know what I'd
do without you two!

19:39.178 --> 19:40.444
PIE PILE!

19:41.346 --> 19:43.982
OK, OK. You're crushing
me to gravel, Pinkie!

19:44.284 --> 19:46.785
I really owe
Mudbriar an apology.

19:47.087 --> 19:49.621
[gasp] And I owe Maud a party!

19:49.923 --> 19:51.555
I just hope I'm not too late!

20:03.937 --> 20:07.171
I brought you an olive
branch to say sorry.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.907
I was really unfair to you,

20:09.008 --> 20:11.642
and I'm ready to listen to your
ideas for Maud's birthday,

20:11.944 --> 20:14.146
if you still want to
plan it together.

20:15.348 --> 20:18.249
Technically, this isn't
even an olive branch.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.986
It's a<i> quercus,</i> most
likely<i> castaneifolia.</i>

20:22.088 --> 20:24.188
OH COME ON!

20:24.959 --> 20:27.158
Uh... Sorry.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.061
Keepin' it together...

20:30.263 --> 20:32.463
And I love a
good<i> quercus</i>.

20:32.765 --> 20:33.664
Friends?

20:34.234 --> 20:35.233
Friends!

20:35.935 --> 20:38.136
Now, do you have any
ideas for the party?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.605
There is one...

20:50.450 --> 20:52.149
SURPRISE!

21:09.068 --> 21:11.803
This is my favorite party ever.

21:12.005 --> 21:14.305
It was all your amazing
boyfriend's idea.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.507
He said the best present would
be me throwing you a surprise

21:16.609 --> 21:18.576
party you didn't have to go to.

21:18.878 --> 21:19.745
Technically?

21:19.846 --> 21:22.613
It wasn't a surprise because
she could see the pre-party

21:22.715 --> 21:24.416
preparations from up here.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.151
"Technically..?"

21:27.653 --> 21:29.253
You're right!
