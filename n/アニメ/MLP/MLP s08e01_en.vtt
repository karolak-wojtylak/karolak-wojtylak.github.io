WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:05.571
Twilight: THIS happened
while we were gone?

00:06.273 --> 00:08.307
Applejack: Wow! Those are
all the places we went

00:08.409 --> 00:10.042
when we left to
save Equestria!

00:10.144 --> 00:13.545
Ugh! There's that HORRID town
where we were almost sold!

00:13.747 --> 00:16.248
The pirates! They were
pretty awesome...

00:16.450 --> 00:18.851
er.. once they decided not
to throw us overboard.

00:19.053 --> 00:21.286
And Mt. Aris! Ooo, Starlight!

00:21.688 --> 00:28.193
Did you know we made seashell
necklaces for AAALLL-LLLL the seaponies?

00:28.595 --> 00:29.495
I...

00:29.797 --> 00:30.629
you...

00:30.731 --> 00:31.447
Really?

00:31.948 --> 00:33.464
What about that unicorn?

00:33.567 --> 00:35.167
The one who attacked
Canterlot?

00:35.469 --> 00:37.836
Tempest. I invited her
to come to Ponyville,

00:37.938 --> 00:39.304
but she wanted to
spread the word

00:39.406 --> 00:40.806
of the Storm
King's defeat...

00:40.908 --> 00:42.741
and share what she
learned about friendship.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.210
Y'all think that's
why the map grew?

00:45.312 --> 00:47.646
Friendship quests
beyond Equestria?

00:47.848 --> 00:49.065
I hope not.

00:49.166 --> 00:51.583
I've had quite enough
life-threatening adventures,

00:51.685 --> 00:52.918
thank you very much.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.890
How many friendship quests do
you think we need to go on

00:58.192 --> 01:00.793
before we have to
expand the throne room?

01:01.395 --> 01:02.962
We can't do it all alone.

01:03.364 --> 01:04.581
Sure we can!

01:04.682 --> 01:07.199
We just need to knock this wall
down, get some paint--

01:07.301 --> 01:09.801
No. I mean the world is
filled with so many different

01:09.903 --> 01:11.871
creatures who know nothing
about friendship.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.439
We need help if we're gonna
teach them all about friendship.

01:14.641 --> 01:15.591
Lots of help.

01:15.892 --> 01:17.442
Rarity: Perhaps. But
where does one go

01:17.545 --> 01:19.345
to learn about
friendship?

01:19.947 --> 01:22.281
Here! They can all go here!

01:22.483 --> 01:24.616
Because we're gonna
open a school!

02:03.957 --> 02:05.891
Celestia: I think a
School of Friendship

02:05.993 --> 02:08.026
is a wonderful
idea, Twilight.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.028
I'll help in
any way I can.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.267
I just have a few questions:

02:15.369 --> 02:16.802
What time should
school start each day?

02:16.903 --> 02:18.536
It really de-
What's the ideal
length for class?

02:18.639 --> 02:19.722
Do you test regularly?

02:19.823 --> 02:21.506
Oh, well that's--
What about
class projects?

02:21.607 --> 02:23.190
That's a ver--
Assigned seating?
Open seating?

02:23.291 --> 02:25.074
Or is that too
unstructured?

02:25.579 --> 02:28.547
Oh, Twilight! You
were my star pupil.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.417
If anyone knows how to
run a school, it's you.

02:32.119 --> 02:34.453
There's a big difference
between attending a school

02:34.555 --> 02:35.371
and running one.

02:35.472 --> 02:37.288
It's not like there's a
rulebook to follow.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.057
Actually, there is.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.560
The EEA guidebook
is very specific

02:41.662 --> 02:42.894
about how to
run a school.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.697
The EEA? I've never
heard of that.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.199
Should I have
heard of that!?

02:47.601 --> 02:50.335
Of course not, you've never
run a school before!

02:50.437 --> 02:52.804
The Equestria Education
Association is a board

02:52.906 --> 02:56.141
of learned ponies that oversee
every school in Equestria.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.576
Even YOUR school?

02:57.978 --> 02:59.511
But you're...YOU!

03:00.013 --> 03:02.114
Not even a Princess can
do whatever she likes

03:02.216 --> 03:04.683
when it comes to shaping
young pony minds.

03:04.885 --> 03:08.053
The EEA ensures that whether
it's unicorns studying magic,

03:08.355 --> 03:09.555
pegasi learning weather,

03:09.657 --> 03:11.890
or earth ponies
researching agriculture,

03:12.092 --> 03:15.194
all schools are held to
the same high standard.

03:15.596 --> 03:16.928
They'll need to
approve your plan

03:17.030 --> 03:18.797
before you can
move forward.

03:19.599 --> 03:20.565
OK, Spike.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.701
Looks like we have a
presentation to make!

03:22.903 --> 03:26.439
Pff. After everything we've been
through, how hard can that be?

03:29.643 --> 03:31.510
I'm gonna go with
really hard.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.246
Uh. Hello. My name is--

03:34.348 --> 03:37.048
Princess Twilight
Sparkle.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.117
I am Chancellor Neighsay.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.353
Equestria owes you
a great debt.

03:41.655 --> 03:45.390
But Princess or no, we expect
you to do things by...

03:45.892 --> 03:46.458
The...

03:46.560 --> 03:47.193
Book!

03:51.098 --> 03:52.698
I think you'll
find my curriculum

03:52.800 --> 03:54.899
meets all your
requirements, Chancellor.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.742
And can we trust you to follow
through with this plan?

04:03.944 --> 04:05.811
Or will you leave the
school unattended

04:05.913 --> 04:08.848
to gallop off on your
... adventures?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.384
My journey beyond Equestria
showed me first hoof

04:12.486 --> 04:15.053
that the threats out there
are greater than we imagined.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.692
If we want to keep
our land safe,

04:20.794 --> 04:22.561
and create a
friendlier tomorrow,

04:22.663 --> 04:25.464
we need to teach the magic
of friendship far and wide.

04:25.966 --> 04:29.735
A school for ponies to learn
how to protect themselves...

04:30.637 --> 04:33.705
Uh, more like respecting
differences and communicating.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.010
The EEA concurs.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.481
Everypony should be prepared
to defend our way of life.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.484
So, if your work is in order,

04:45.886 --> 04:49.621
provisional EEA
approval is granted.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.924
We will need to observe your
school up and running

04:53.026 --> 04:55.627
before it can be
fully accredited.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.664
Then please, join us for
Friends and Family Day.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.932
It'll be a perfect time
to see our progress!

05:17.985 --> 05:19.050
Rainbow Dash: It's too much!

05:19.252 --> 05:21.019
TOO MUCH!

05:21.121 --> 05:22.772
Rarity: Ah! You think so!?

05:22.973 --> 05:25.824
I had hoped dressing the part
would help me<i> feel</i> the part.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.526
Not your dress!

05:27.728 --> 05:30.729
This! Us! Teaching?

05:30.831 --> 05:33.231
They're gonna think
I'm an egghead!

05:35.469 --> 05:38.937
Well, the students are gonna
LOVE my confetti cannon class.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.006
It's gonna be.. a blast!

05:41.976 --> 05:44.409
Um. Hello there.
I'm your teacher.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.044
I hope you enjoy class.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.647
But if you don't enjoy it,
that's OK, too.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.584
I don't know about all this...

05:52.786 --> 05:54.319
It's going to be fine.

05:54.621 --> 05:57.356
Everything about this
school just feels right.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.358
See? If Twilight
isn't stressed,

06:00.460 --> 06:02.394
you've got nothing
to worry about!

06:03.296 --> 06:06.398
And you're SURE you
want US to be teachers?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.300
In.. classrooms?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.536
The EEA is VERY clear on how
schools should be run.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.139
We have a HUGE
responsibility,

06:14.241 --> 06:16.742
and I need you all to do
this by the book.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.278
That means no cannons
in class, Pinkie.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.048
Awwwwww! Not even
a teeny cannon..?

06:25.786 --> 06:28.752
I know it's not some big adventure
against the forces of evil.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.055
But this could be the
most important thing

06:31.158 --> 06:32.190
we've ever done!

06:32.292 --> 06:33.658
I can't run a school
of Friendship

06:33.760 --> 06:35.126
without my best friends.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.628
Can I count on you?

06:37.130 --> 06:39.264
Of course you
can, darling.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.934
Call me Professor
Egghead. I'm in.

06:45.557 --> 06:49.508
AHHHH! FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!
SO MANY NEW PONIES!

06:49.810 --> 06:52.344
About that. ONE thing
I forgot to mention.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.279
It's not JUST ponies...

06:59.286 --> 07:00.785
That was unexpected!

07:06.660 --> 07:09.728
Oooh! Students certainly
traveled from far and wide

07:09.830 --> 07:11.396
to attend our school!

07:11.498 --> 07:13.999
Princess Celestia helped me
reach out to all the kingdoms.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.734
After all, friendship
is something

07:15.836 --> 07:18.637
that needs to be shared
with every...creature.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.874
Welcome to the School
of Friendship!

07:23.176 --> 07:25.444
I'm your headmare,
Twilight Sparkle!

07:25.646 --> 07:27.612
Please follow Guidance
Counselor Starlight

07:27.714 --> 07:29.715
to sign in and get your
class assignments.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.883
Then we can show you
your living quarters!

07:34.621 --> 07:35.987
Whoa, sorry!

07:36.289 --> 07:37.356
I'm Sandbar.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.291
Are you a student
here, too?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.893
No. I just figured I'd
randomly stand here

07:41.995 --> 07:43.795
and see how many ponies
would walk into me.

07:44.697 --> 07:45.997
Angry male voice: GALLUS!

07:48.936 --> 07:50.335
Grandpa Gruff!

07:50.437 --> 07:51.570
What are you
doing here?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.438
Flew all the way
from Griffonstone

07:53.540 --> 07:56.140
to introduce Gallus.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.077
Rainbow Dash, right?

07:59.179 --> 08:00.712
Gilda told me about you.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.848
You're a teacher?

08:01.949 --> 08:04.783
Huh. Thought you'd
be... cooler.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.486
Gruff male voice: PONIES!

08:07.788 --> 08:09.922
Prince Rutherford!

08:10.524 --> 08:11.924
This Yona Yak.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.359
She come to pony school.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.195
Make it better.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.897
Yak can't wait
to meet ponies

08:19.199 --> 08:21.366
and tell ALL about
Yakyakistan!

08:27.841 --> 08:30.476
Why don't I show you around
before you destroy the place?

08:30.978 --> 08:32.778
But dragons are
better than this.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.347
Why am I here?

08:35.449 --> 08:39.318
Because as Dragon Lord,
I'm ordering you to be here!

08:40.220 --> 08:43.054
Hey! Spike! Come meet Smolder.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.190
Great to see you, Ember.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.194
Uh... Which one is Smolder?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.033
Ocellus!

08:54.735 --> 08:56.168
What did we
talk about?

08:58.705 --> 08:59.504
I told you.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.206
Stay in your
own form.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.908
It's the polite
thing to do.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.210
Sorry.. She's shy.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.979
What is THAT?

09:13.186 --> 09:14.853
No way!

09:14.955 --> 09:17.489
I didn't know ponies
could turn into...

09:17.591 --> 09:19.157
Um...what are you?

09:19.459 --> 09:20.426
A changeling.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.795
Ponies can turn into
changelings!?

09:24.197 --> 09:27.366
No. But changelings
can turn into ponies.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.901
Huh. That's confusing.

09:33.658 --> 09:37.843
I am General Seaspray of Her
Majesty Queen Novo's navy.

09:38.145 --> 09:42.080
I would like to introduce the
queen's niece, Silverstream.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.884
This place is amazing!

09:45.986 --> 09:47.953
I've spent most of my life in
a coral reef under water.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.055
I was a seapony. But now I'm
a hippogriff, long story.

09:50.157 --> 09:53.458
Anyways... WOW!
IS THAT A YAK!?

09:58.432 --> 10:00.799
Thank you so much for
supporting the grand opening

10:00.901 --> 10:01.951
of our school.

10:02.152 --> 10:04.802
I hope you'll all join us for
Friends and Family Day

10:04.905 --> 10:08.039
to see the amazing progress
your students are making!

10:11.144 --> 10:12.977

Is this what boring is?

12:50.170 --> 12:50.969
Am I bored?

12:51.071 --> 12:52.571
Ugh. Please.

12:52.673 --> 12:55.774
THESE ponies are the
heroes of Equestria?

12:55.876 --> 12:59.878
Listen, "these ponies" saved
all of us from The Storm King.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.081
How? By boring him
into surrender?

13:03.283 --> 13:06.585
Our teachers are a little
different than I expected.

13:06.687 --> 13:08.987
Agh! Pony school
waste of time!

13:09.189 --> 13:11.356
YAK school teach how
to braid Yak hair!

13:11.458 --> 13:13.057
BRAIDING YAK HAIR IS BEST!

13:13.159 --> 13:14.092
Whoa!

13:14.194 --> 13:15.294
Oof!

13:16.196 --> 13:19.231
Is there anything in Yakyakistan
that isn't the best?

13:19.733 --> 13:21.800
Yes! Wait. No!

13:21.902 --> 13:22.701
Yaks best.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.103
No claws, no
wings, no fire.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.238
What is it exactly
you're proud of?

13:27.340 --> 13:29.240
Whoa, cool it.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.911
No need to harsh Yona's
love for her heritage. OK?

13:33.013 --> 13:33.913
Aww.

13:34.014 --> 13:37.214
Are we not being sweet and
friendly enough for you, pony?

13:37.517 --> 13:38.650
That was sarcasm, right?

13:38.752 --> 13:41.352
Because you weren't
being sweet or nice?

13:41.454 --> 13:44.555
Maybe dragons and griffons are
just too tough for friendship.

13:45.759 --> 13:46.658
Yaks tough.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.360
Just not nasty.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.395
Who you calling
nasty, klutz?

13:51.799 --> 13:55.000
OK, break it up!
BREAK. IT. UP!

13:55.502 --> 13:57.269
What is going
on here?

13:57.671 --> 14:01.172
Just a friendly discussion
about the magic of friendship

14:01.274 --> 14:03.208
amongst friends.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.077
Everypony--I
mean--everyONE--

14:06.179 --> 14:07.578
go to your next class!

14:09.650 --> 14:10.749
I just can't
believe it.

14:10.951 --> 14:11.767
Fights breaking out

14:11.868 --> 14:13.784
when they're supposed to
be learnin' friendship?

14:14.187 --> 14:16.755
Things definitely aren't
going as "by the book"

14:16.857 --> 14:18.256
as Twilight planned.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.426
That's because we're
terrible teachers!

14:21.628 --> 14:25.029
Face it. This school
isn't gonna work.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.168
Applejack: Fights breaking out
in the hallways!

14:31.905 --> 14:33.738
I don't look like
that! Do I?

14:35.275 --> 14:36.208
I get it.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.842
Things are getting off to a
rougher start than expected.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.512
But that's OK!

14:40.914 --> 14:43.348
Who are you and what have you
done with Twilight Sparkle?

14:44.518 --> 14:47.218
Every school in Equestria
follows these rules.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.554
As long as we do
too, we'll be fine.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.256
Maybe we should...

14:51.458 --> 14:52.491
try something new?

14:52.693 --> 14:54.492
The EEA will be
here this afternoon

14:54.594 --> 14:55.895
for Friends and Family Day.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.797
They need to see a school that
follows their guidelines.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.100
Even if those guidelines
aren't working..?

15:02.602 --> 15:05.737
Well, then, we have to try
harder and make sure they do.

15:07.508 --> 15:10.909
Another morning, another
chance to inspire our students.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.550
Hey! Professor Dash's
class is this way.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.418
Where are you going?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.987
You're not...
skipping, are you?

15:23.089 --> 15:24.889
That's exactly
what we're doing.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.324
But Friends and
Family Day--

15:26.426 --> 15:28.660
--is AFTER class.

15:29.062 --> 15:33.264
Relax! This is just a
quick... mental health break.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.601
That sounds legit.

15:36.803 --> 15:37.636
We're in.

15:37.738 --> 15:39.704
I guess I'll
tag along too...

15:40.006 --> 15:42.907
make sure you don't
get into.. trouble.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.679
Fluttershy: This
way, Angel.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.180
Professor Fluttershy!

15:49.282 --> 15:50.782
We're busted!

15:53.653 --> 15:56.087
Oh my! What are
you all doing?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.889
Aren't classes
that way?

15:59.226 --> 16:02.995
A generosity field
trip, dahhhling.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.830
I'm taking the students
to the laaake...

16:06.232 --> 16:08.533
to look at our
divine reflections.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.670
Oh. That sounds nice.

16:12.772 --> 16:13.672
Have fun!

16:19.646 --> 16:22.513
I take back everything
I said about you.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.082
That was cool!

16:24.284 --> 16:24.983
Thanks!

16:25.285 --> 16:26.985
Wait...What did you
say about me?

16:29.055 --> 16:31.022
You're sure sticking to the
book is going to work?

16:31.324 --> 16:32.958
My friends can
handle anything.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.526
They'll have these problems
turned around before we know it.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.794
Problems?

16:37.764 --> 16:38.997
Chancellor Neighsay!

16:39.199 --> 16:40.065
You're here!

16:40.567 --> 16:44.502
Yes. And you
seem unprepared.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.137
If there are problems...

16:46.439 --> 16:48.506
Problems? Ha!
Of course not!

16:48.608 --> 16:50.208
We can't wait to
show you around.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.478
[nervous laugh]

16:54.580 --> 16:59.050
And that's why griffons
breathe fire when we get mad.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.551
They do NOT!

17:00.653 --> 17:01.986
Wait, do they?

17:02.088 --> 17:03.421
No. Really?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.590
Griffons just full of hot air.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.194
And yaks are actually
good at jokes.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.062
How about that?

17:11.264 --> 17:12.998
What are dragons
good at?

17:13.600 --> 17:14.833
Competition.

17:14.935 --> 17:16.167
Who's up for a race?

17:19.773 --> 17:21.073
Rainbow Dash!

17:21.274 --> 17:22.674
Why aren't you in
class teaching?

17:22.876 --> 17:24.475
Because my
students are gone!

17:25.545 --> 17:27.646
Uh, gone...somewhere else!

17:28.048 --> 17:29.481
Doing a loyalty lesson.

17:29.583 --> 17:32.984
And I was just going to
grab, uh ... this pencil!

17:33.086 --> 17:34.118
Because they need it.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.086
Wherever they are.

17:35.188 --> 17:35.788
Which I know...

17:35.889 --> 17:38.089
cause.. I'm the teacher.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.960
I see. Well, Chancellor,
we have other classes.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.962
We can just...---
Let's follow the... professor.

17:45.365 --> 17:48.933
I'm quite curious about
this "lesson in loyalty."

17:53.473 --> 17:55.473
<i> Twilight: Of course,</i>
<i> we want to instill</i>

17:55.575 --> 17:57.776
<i> a sense of loyalty</i>
<i> towards others.</i>

17:58.378 --> 18:01.079
<i> We encourage acts of</i>
<i> generosity and kindness.</i>

18:04.184 --> 18:06.751
Figured we shouldn't be the
only ones enjoying the view.

18:07.153 --> 18:12.390
AGH! YAKS NOT BEST AT FLYING!

18:12.492 --> 18:15.059
<i> An appreciation for</i>
<i> the value of laughter.</i>

18:15.261 --> 18:17.628
FLYING IS BEST!

18:17.730 --> 18:19.931
Congratulations, Yona!

18:20.033 --> 18:23.334
You are officially the weirdest
thing I've seen so far!

18:23.536 --> 18:25.069
What do you say, Ocellus?

18:25.171 --> 18:28.005
Can you be weirder
than a flying yak?

18:30.377 --> 18:31.910
OH!

18:32.012 --> 18:34.645
... and to always be
honest in any situation.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.314
Honesty is imperative.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.683
Princess, are we
going in circles?

18:38.985 --> 18:40.285
Uh...look at the time!

18:40.487 --> 18:42.754
We'd better head to the lake
for Friends and Family Day!

18:42.856 --> 18:45.356
I'm sure all the students and
faculty will be there!

18:56.669 --> 18:57.502
Ha ha!

18:59.239 --> 19:00.505
What is that!?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.416
THE SCHOOL IS UNDER ATTACK!

19:19.592 --> 19:20.725
Oh my goodness!

19:20.927 --> 19:22.328
Whoa!

19:32.005 --> 19:35.340
Uh, maybe skipping class
wasn't the best idea?

19:36.042 --> 19:37.809
How DARE you!

19:38.011 --> 19:39.844
This act of aggression
against ponies--

19:39.946 --> 19:41.412
I'm so sorry,
Chancellor.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.082
We clearly had some students
get a little carried away.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.884
THOSE are students?

19:46.186 --> 19:48.319
But, you said you were
opening this school

19:48.421 --> 19:49.854
to protect Equestria!

19:50.056 --> 19:53.258
To defend ponies from
dangerous creatures

19:53.560 --> 19:56.261
who don't have our best
interests at heart.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.863
My school teaches for all
of us to work together

19:58.965 --> 19:59.832
through friendship.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.668
And how do you know
these.. creatures

20:03.770 --> 20:07.105
won't take what they've learned
here and use it against us?

20:07.507 --> 20:09.207
Friendship isn't
just for ponies.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.675
It should be!

20:11.277 --> 20:13.678
Unicorn think yaks
no need friendship?

20:14.280 --> 20:17.248
Maybe yaks no
need pony school!

20:17.450 --> 20:22.386
Well, then perhaps you
should return to your kind.

20:22.588 --> 20:24.322
"Your kind!?"

20:24.424 --> 20:26.290
Smolder? Let's go!

20:29.229 --> 20:31.796
Queen Novo will want
to hear of this.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.700
This place seemed
lame anyways.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.306
It's fine.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.341
We know not everypony
sees us the way you do.

20:43.643 --> 20:44.943
We're used to it.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.215
Princess Celestia helped me
reach out to all the kingdoms.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.001
When she hears you closed
the school because--

20:53.102 --> 20:56.586
Because you failed to
meet the EEA's standards?

20:56.889 --> 20:57.755
What!?

20:57.857 --> 20:59.423
Irresponsible teachers.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.059
Students skipping class!

21:01.161 --> 21:02.994
Endangering ponies!

21:03.096 --> 21:05.130
Your school is a disaster.

21:05.732 --> 21:09.133
Perhaps if you had higher
standards for who was admitted,

21:09.235 --> 21:10.868
this could have been avoided.

21:11.804 --> 21:12.804
Regardless...

21:22.915 --> 21:24.849
By order of the EEA,

21:24.951 --> 21:28.686
I am shutting
this school DOWN.

21:28.888 --> 21:29.721
Oh!
