00:04.119 --> 00:08.228
Once upon a time,
in a magical land of Equestria...

00:09.948 --> 00:12.510
...there were two regal sisters
who ruled together...

00:12.852 --> 00:14.935
...and created harmony for all the land.

00:15.620 --> 00:20.289
To do this, the eldest used her unicorn
powers to raise the sun at dawn...

00:20.897 --> 00:23.593
...the younger brought out
the moon to begin the night.

00:24.569 --> 00:28.766
Thus, the two sisters maintained balance
for their kingdom and their subjects:

00:28.866 --> 00:31.128
All the different types of ponies.

00:31.214 --> 00:34.868
But as time went on,
the younger sister became resentful.

00:35.215 --> 00:39.069
The ponies relished and played in the day
her elder sister brought forth...

00:39.085 --> 00:41.996
...but shunned and slept
through her beautiful night.

00:42.775 --> 00:47.716
One fateful day, the younger unicorn refused
to lower the moon to make way for the dawn.

00:47.916 --> 00:50.716
The elder sister tried to reason with her...

00:50.967 --> 00:53.090
...but the bitterness in the young one's heart...

00:53.183 --> 00:56.151
...had transformed her into a
wicked mare of darkness:

00:56.422 --> 00:58.327
Nightmare Moon.

00:58.796 --> 01:02.403
She vowed that she would shroud
the land in eternal night.

01:03.340 --> 01:08.156
Reluctantly, the elder sister harnessed
the most powerful magic known to ponydom:

01:08.487 --> 01:10.774
The Elements of Harmony!

01:11.112 --> 01:15.573
Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony,
she defeated her younger sister...

01:15.599 --> 01:17.922
...and banished her permanently in the moon.

01:19.734 --> 01:23.790
The elder sister took on responsibility
for both sun and moon....

01:23.896 --> 01:27.455
...and harmony has been maintained
in Equestria for generations since.

01:30.610 --> 01:32.906
Hm... Elements of Harmony.

01:33.332 --> 01:35.406
I know I've heard of those before.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.215
But where?

01:39.632 --> 01:45.318
<i>My Little Pony, My Little Pony...
Aaaaah...</i>

01:45.319 --> 01:47.468
<i>My Little Pony</i>

01:47.680 --> 01:49.744
<i>I used to wonder what friendship could be.</i>

01:49.745 --> 01:51.451
<i>My Little Pony</i>

01:51.650 --> 01:53.979
<i>Until you all shared its magic with me.</i>

01:54.269 --> 01:56.086
<i>Big adventure
Tons of fun</i>

01:56.087 --> 01:58.244
<i>A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong</i>

01:58.344 --> 02:00.155
<i>Sharing kindness
It's an easy feat</i>

02:00.156 --> 02:02.189
<i>And magic makes it all complete!</i>

02:02.289 --> 02:04.389
<i>You have My Little Pony...</i>

02:04.616 --> 02:11.484
<i>Do you know you are my very best friends?</i>

02:17.916 --> 02:19.901
There you are, Twilight!

02:19.902 --> 02:23.397
Moondancer is having a little get-together
in the west castle courtyard.

02:23.581 --> 02:24.599
You wanna come?

02:24.608 --> 02:29.079
Oh, sorry girls. I got a lot
of studying to catch up on.

02:32.307 --> 02:34.850
Does that pony do anything except study?

02:35.121 --> 02:38.330
I think she's more interested
in books than friends.

02:38.632 --> 02:41.275
I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.

02:54.310 --> 02:56.575
Spike! Spike!!!

02:56.832 --> 02:57.950
Spike?

02:58.265 --> 02:59.476
There you are.

03:01.054 --> 03:03.884
Quick, find me that old copy of
"Predictions and prophecies".

03:04.695 --> 03:05.921
What's that for?

03:07.232 --> 03:10.354
Well, it was a gift for Moondancer, but...

03:11.072 --> 03:14.181
Oh, Spike. You know we don't
have time for that sort of thing.

03:14.315 --> 03:15.990
But we're on a break!

03:21.392 --> 03:24.570
No... no, no, no no no!

03:25.806 --> 03:26.774
SPIKE!!!

03:26.775 --> 03:28.591
It's over here!

03:36.326 --> 03:39.607
Elements... elements, e e e... Aha!

03:39.621 --> 03:43.070
Elements of Harmony... See: Mare in the Moon?

03:43.296 --> 03:46.599
Mare in the Moon?
But that's just an old ponies' tale.

03:47.007 --> 03:48.936
Mare... mare... AHA!

03:49.105 --> 03:52.336
"The Mare in the Moon - myth
from olden pony times..."

03:52.411 --> 03:54.938
"...a powerful pony, who
wanted to rule Equestria..."

03:55.219 --> 03:57.984
"...defeated by the Elements of Harmony
and imprisoned in the moon."

03:58.205 --> 04:00.904
"Legend has it that on the longest
day of the thousandth year..."

04:01.174 --> 04:05.333
"...the stars will aid in her escape and
she will bring about nighttime eternal."

04:05.731 --> 04:07.819
Spike! Do you know what this means?

04:07.979 --> 04:09.097
No.

04:12.163 --> 04:14.437
Take a note, please. To the Princess.

04:14.438 --> 04:15.868
Okie dokie.

04:16.489 --> 04:21.026
"My dearest teacher. My continuing studies
of pony magic have led me to discover..."

04:21.180 --> 04:23.879
-"...that we're on the precipice of disaster."
-Hold on!

04:24.156 --> 04:26.086
Preci... preci...

04:28.143 --> 04:30.088
-Threshold.
-Threee...

04:32.211 --> 04:33.552
Uh... Brink?

04:36.674 --> 04:38.797
That something really bad is about to happen!

04:40.581 --> 04:44.473
"For you see, the mythical Mare in
the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon..."

04:44.583 --> 04:48.349
"...and she's about to return to Equestria
and bring with her eternal night."

04:48.591 --> 04:52.341
"Something must be done to make sure this
terrible prophecy does not come true."

04:53.137 --> 04:57.717
"I await your quick response.
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

04:57.874 --> 05:02.463
Twilight. Sparkle. Got it!

05:02.495 --> 05:03.563
Great! Send it.

05:04.062 --> 05:05.554
-Now?
-Of course!

05:06.650 --> 05:08.079
I don't know, Twilight.

05:08.171 --> 05:11.937
Princess Celestia is a little busy getting
ready for the Summer Sun Celebration.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.796
And it's, like, the day after tomorrow.

05:14.133 --> 05:15.326
That's just it, Spike.

05:15.505 --> 05:19.383
The day after tomorrow is the thousandth
year of the Summer Sun Celebration.

05:19.471 --> 05:22.033
It's imperative that
the Princess is told right away.

05:23.496 --> 05:26.867
Impera... impera...

05:26.891 --> 05:28.154
Important!

05:28.909 --> 05:30.901
Okay, okay.

05:34.184 --> 05:35.874
There! It's on its way.

05:36.412 --> 05:38.676
But I wouldn't hold your breath.

05:38.677 --> 05:39.996
Oh, I'm not worried, Spike.

05:40.024 --> 05:41.896
The Princess trusts me completely.

05:42.082 --> 05:45.336
In all the years she's been my mentor,
she's never once doubted me.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.686
See? I knew she would wanna
take immediate action.

05:53.658 --> 05:56.391
"My dearest, most faithful student, Twilight."

05:56.561 --> 06:00.513
"You know that I value your diligence
and that I trust you completely."

06:01.181 --> 06:04.688
"But you simply must stop
reading those dusty old books."

06:08.618 --> 06:12.118
"My Dear Twilight. There is more to
a young pony's life than studying."

06:12.951 --> 06:15.401
"So I'm sending you
to supervise the preparations..."

06:15.453 --> 06:20.026
"...for the Summer Sun Celebration in
this year's location, Ponyville."

06:21.133 --> 06:25.040
"And I have an even more essential
task for you to complete."

06:25.440 --> 06:27.260
"Make some friends!"

06:28.714 --> 06:30.370
Look on the bright side, Twilight.

06:30.371 --> 06:34.272
The Princess arranged for you to stay in a library.
Doesn't that make you happy?

06:35.105 --> 06:38.174
Yes! Yes it does. You know why?
Because I'm right.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.497
I'll check on the preparations
as fast as I can...

06:40.651 --> 06:43.452
...then get to the library and find
some proof of Nightmare Moon's return.

06:43.468 --> 06:46.698
Then when will you make friends,
like the Princess said?

06:46.951 --> 06:51.284
She said to check on preparations.
I am her student and I'll do my royal duty.

06:51.424 --> 06:54.481
But the fate of Equestria does
not rest on me making friends.

06:57.290 --> 06:58.693
Thank you, sirs.

06:59.550 --> 07:03.046
Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have
interesting things to talk about?

07:04.628 --> 07:06.750
Come on, Twilight. Just try.

07:09.102 --> 07:10.009
Hello?

07:14.764 --> 07:16.698
Well, that was interesting, all right.

07:19.807 --> 07:23.675
Summer Sun Celebration:
Official Overseer's Checklist.

07:23.829 --> 07:27.900
Number 1: Banquet preparations.
Sweet Apple Acres.

07:28.376 --> 07:30.433
YEEHAW!

07:37.397 --> 07:39.145
Let's get this over with.

07:39.317 --> 07:42.694
Good afternoon. My name is Twilight Sparkle...

07:43.449 --> 07:46.906
Well, howdy-do, miss Twilight?
A pleasure makin' your acquaintance.

07:47.009 --> 07:51.200
I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres
sure do like makin' new friends.

07:51.359 --> 07:54.254
Friends? Actually... I...

07:54.470 --> 07:56.165
So, what can I do you for?

07:59.957 --> 08:03.794
Well, I am in fact here to supervise
preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration.

08:03.966 --> 08:05.659
And you're in charge of the food?

08:05.734 --> 08:08.532
We sure as sugar are.
Would you care to sample some?

08:08.756 --> 08:10.824
As long as it doesn't take too long.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.057
Soup's on, everypony!

08:21.129 --> 08:24.256
Now, why don't I introduce
y'all to the Apple family?

08:25.241 --> 08:27.411
Thanks, but I really need to hurry.

08:27.412 --> 08:31.489
This here's Apple Fritter,
Apple Bumpkin, Red Gala...

08:31.490 --> 08:36.865
...Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel
Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apple,
Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp...

08:37.842 --> 08:43.151
Big Macintosh, Apple Bloom
aaaand Granny Smith.

08:43.605 --> 08:46.158
Up and at 'em Granny Smith. We got guests.

08:46.855 --> 08:49.345
Wha...? Soup's on?

08:49.346 --> 08:51.549
I'm up, here I come, I'm comin'...

08:51.755 --> 08:54.808
Why, I'd say they're already part of the family.

08:57.320 --> 09:02.834
Okay. Well, I can see the food situation
is handled, so we'll be on our way.

09:03.016 --> 09:04.943
Aren't you gonna to stay for brunch?

09:06.985 --> 09:10.372
Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do...

09:14.412 --> 09:15.388
Fine.

09:22.265 --> 09:25.146
Food's all taken care of. Next is weather.

09:26.529 --> 09:29.625
Ugh... I ate too much pie.

09:30.679 --> 09:34.856
There's supposed to be a pegasus pony
named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds.

09:36.415 --> 09:38.933
Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she?

09:46.229 --> 09:48.090
Uh... Excuse me?

09:51.407 --> 09:52.671
Let me help you.

10:01.553 --> 10:06.191
Oops. I guess I overdid it.
Um... uh, how about this?

10:06.442 --> 10:10.666
My very own patented Rain-Blow Dry.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.378
No no, don't thank me. You're quite welcome.

10:23.172 --> 10:26.073
Let me guess, you're Rainbow Dash.

10:26.574 --> 10:28.589
The one and only!

10:29.194 --> 10:30.450
Why? You heard of me?

10:30.534 --> 10:33.087
I heard you're supposed
to be keeping the sky clear.

10:34.613 --> 10:37.683
I'm Twilight Sparkle and the Princess
sent me to check on the weather.

10:37.695 --> 10:39.579
Yeah, yeah. That'll be a snap.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.735
I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon
as I'm done practicing.

10:42.766 --> 10:44.293
Practicing for what?

10:44.407 --> 10:46.491
The Wonderbolts!

10:46.945 --> 10:48.963
They're gonna perform at
the celebration tomorrow.

10:49.214 --> 10:51.383
And I'm gonna show 'em my stuff.

10:51.691 --> 10:53.676
-*The* Wonderbolts?
-Yup.

10:53.862 --> 10:57.010
The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?

10:57.186 --> 10:57.949
That's them!

10:58.027 --> 10:59.364
Pfft... Please.

10:59.365 --> 11:03.866
They'd never accept a pegasus who can't
even keep the sky clear for one measly day.

11:03.909 --> 11:07.523
Hey. I could clear the sky in ten seconds flat.

11:08.157 --> 11:09.168
Prove it.

11:16.762 --> 11:19.044
Loop-de-loop around and WHAM!

11:20.481 --> 11:24.045
What'd I say. Ten. Seconds. Flat.

11:24.502 --> 11:26.603
I'd never leave Ponyville hanging.

11:28.969 --> 11:31.398
You should see the look on your face.

11:32.319 --> 11:36.104
You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle.
I can't wait to hang out some more.

11:37.646 --> 11:40.745
Wow. She's amazing!

11:45.200 --> 11:48.268
Wait! It's kinda pretty once you get used to it.

11:51.409 --> 11:55.234
Decorations. Beautiful...

11:55.340 --> 11:57.757
Yes. The decor's coming along nicely.

11:57.884 --> 12:01.086
This oughta be quick.
I'll be at the library in no time.

12:01.314 --> 12:02.516
Beautiful indeed.

12:02.539 --> 12:04.886
Not the decor. Her!

12:05.474 --> 12:09.553
No, no, no... Oh my goodness no.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.675
How are my spines? Are they straight?

12:14.954 --> 12:16.047
Good afternoon.

12:16.048 --> 12:19.049
Just a moment, please.
I'm in the zone as it were.

12:19.412 --> 12:23.154
Oh yes! Sparkle always does
the trick, does it not?

12:23.210 --> 12:25.134
Why, Rarity, you are a talent!

12:25.320 --> 12:29.064
Now... um, how can I help youuuuaAARGH!

12:29.261 --> 12:33.500
Oh my stars, darling! What ever
happened to your coiffure?

12:33.529 --> 12:37.019
Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story.

12:37.020 --> 12:39.932
I'm just here to check on the decorations
and then I'll be out of your hair.

12:40.031 --> 12:42.813
Out of MY hair? What about YOUR hair?

12:43.497 --> 12:46.853
Wait! Where are we going? HELP!

12:48.846 --> 12:51.027
No, no, uh-uh.

12:51.028 --> 12:57.108
Too green. Too yellow. Too puffy.
Not puffy enough. Too frilly. Too shiny.

12:57.726 --> 13:01.946
Now go on, my dear.
You were telling me where you're from.

13:03.227 --> 13:09.523
I've... urgh... been... sent...
from... Canterlot... to...

13:11.263 --> 13:12.616
Canterlot?!

13:12.694 --> 13:15.980
Oh, I am so envious. The glamor, the sophistication.

13:16.141 --> 13:18.826
I've always dreamed of living there!

13:18.903 --> 13:21.987
I can't wait to hear all about it.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.521
We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I.

13:26.319 --> 13:28.899
Emerald?! What was I thinking?

13:28.900 --> 13:30.946
Let me get you some rubies!

13:30.998 --> 13:33.661
Quick! Before she decides
to dye my coat a new color.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.681
Wasn't she wonderful?

13:38.974 --> 13:41.604
Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?

13:42.297 --> 13:45.273
Oh. Music. It's the last one.

13:56.448 --> 13:59.080
Oh my. Um... Stop, please, everyone.

14:00.048 --> 14:05.488
Excuse me, sir. I mean, no offense.
But your rhythm is just a teeny, tiny bit off.

14:06.361 --> 14:11.213
Now follow me, please. A one.
A two. A one-two-three...

14:11.214 --> 14:11.870
Hello!

14:13.274 --> 14:16.661
Oh my. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten your birds.

14:16.876 --> 14:20.216
I'm just here to check up on the music
and it's sounding beautiful.

14:26.259 --> 14:27.610
I'm Twilight Sparkle.

14:29.836 --> 14:30.981
What's your name?

14:31.710 --> 14:34.753
Um... I'm Fluttershy...

14:35.367 --> 14:36.548
I'm sorry, what was that?

14:38.749 --> 14:40.701
My name is ...

14:40.936 --> 14:42.166
Didn't quite catch that.

14:49.257 --> 14:54.720
Well, um, it looks like your birds are back,
so I guess everything's in order.

14:55.025 --> 14:56.389
Keep up the good work!

14:58.895 --> 15:00.326
Ooookay.

15:01.587 --> 15:02.708
Well, that was easy.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.684
A BABY DRAGON!

15:07.104 --> 15:09.915
Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before.

15:10.211 --> 15:12.443
He's so cute!

15:12.472 --> 15:14.334
Well well well.

15:14.418 --> 15:18.187
Oh my, he talks.
I didn't know dragons could talk.

15:18.281 --> 15:21.339
That's just so incredibly wonderful. I...

15:21.340 --> 15:23.792
I just don't even know what to say.

15:24.347 --> 15:26.284
Well, in that case we better be going.

15:26.438 --> 15:28.702
Wait, wait! What's his name?

15:28.932 --> 15:30.040
I'm Spike.

15:30.041 --> 15:32.301
Hi, Spike. I'm Fluttershy.

15:32.302 --> 15:36.407
Wow! A talking dragon!
And what do dragons talk about?

15:36.416 --> 15:41.379
-Well, what do you wanna know?
-Absolutely everything!

15:43.173 --> 15:47.807
Well, I started out as a cute
little purple-and-green egg...

15:48.483 --> 15:51.623
...and that's the story of my whole entire life.

15:51.950 --> 15:54.807
Well, up until today.
Do you wanna hear about today?

15:54.978 --> 15:56.806
Oh yes, please!

15:57.579 --> 16:00.962
I am so sorry! How did we get here so fast?

16:01.001 --> 16:02.976
This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.568
-And my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.
-No, I don't!

16:07.423 --> 16:11.919
Awww, wook at that. He's so sweepy, he
can't even keep his wittle bawance.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.540
Poor thing. You simply must get into bed!

16:16.738 --> 16:19.437
Yes yes. We'll get right on that.
Well, goodnight!

16:21.021 --> 16:22.545
Huh. Rude much?

16:22.704 --> 16:26.459
Sorry, Spike. But I have to convince the
Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming...

16:26.460 --> 16:29.685
...and we're running out of time!
I just need to be alone, so I can study...

16:29.686 --> 16:32.395
...without a bunch of crazy ponies
trying to make friends all the time.

16:32.573 --> 16:33.774
Now where's the light?

16:34.415 --> 16:36.840
SURPRISE!

16:40.722 --> 16:42.213
Surprise!

16:42.280 --> 16:45.092
Hi! I'm Pinkie Pie and I threw
this party just for you!

16:45.093 --> 16:47.172
Were you surprised, were you, were you?
Huh huh huh?

16:47.180 --> 16:50.793
Very surprised.
Libraries are supposed to be quiet.

16:50.824 --> 16:53.851
That's silly! What kind of welcome
party would this be if it were quiet?

16:54.087 --> 16:56.188
I mean, DUH! BORING!

16:56.417 --> 17:00.479

17:25.403 --> 17:27.457
Are you alright, sugar cube?

17:30.202 --> 17:32.970
Awww, she's so happy, she's crying!

17:35.819 --> 17:37.406
Hot sauce.

17:40.786 --> 17:42.782
What? It's good!

17:51.024 --> 17:54.844
Hey, Twilight! Pinkie Pie started
Pin the Tail on the Pony. Wanna play?

17:54.931 --> 18:00.094
No! All the ponies in this town are CRAZY!
Do you know what time it is?

18:00.199 --> 18:02.415
It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration.

18:02.416 --> 18:05.755
Everypony has to stay up or they'll
miss the Princess raise the sun.

18:05.826 --> 18:09.679
You really should lighten up Twilight.
It's a party!

18:12.794 --> 18:15.869
Here I thought I'd have time to learn
more about the Elements of Harmony.

18:15.881 --> 18:20.246
But, silly me, all this ridiculous
friendmaking has kept me from it!

18:24.003 --> 18:26.842
"Legend has it that in the longest day
of the thousandth year..."

18:26.843 --> 18:31.044
"...the stars will aid in her escape and
she will bring about everlasting night."

18:32.348 --> 18:36.953
I hope the Princess was right.
I hope it really is just an old pony tale.

18:37.024 --> 18:39.496
Come on, Twilight!
It's time to watch the sun rise!

18:48.118 --> 18:49.383
Isn't this exciting?

18:49.384 --> 18:51.951

18:54.544 --> 18:56.658
But, I mean, really, who can top that?

19:03.561 --> 19:05.542
Fillies and gentlecolts.

19:05.604 --> 19:08.828
As mayor of Ponyville,
it is my great pleasure...

19:08.829 --> 19:12.788
...to announce the beginning
of the Summer Sun Celebration!

19:16.152 --> 19:20.438
In just a few moments our town will
witness the magic of the sunrise.

19:20.573 --> 19:24.103
And celebrate this, the longest day of the year!

19:24.715 --> 19:29.391
And now it is my great honor to
introduce to you the ruler of our land.

19:29.551 --> 19:32.982
The very pony, who gives us the sun
and the moon each and every day.

19:33.045 --> 19:37.728
The good, the wise, the bringer
of harmony to all of Equestria...

19:38.155 --> 19:38.842
Ready?

19:39.259 --> 19:41.362
...Princess Celestia!

19:46.244 --> 19:47.976
This can't be good.

19:48.821 --> 19:52.827
Remain calm, everypony.
There must be a reasonable explanation.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.813
I love guessing games! Is she hiding?

19:57.153 --> 19:58.505
She's gone!

20:01.809 --> 20:03.949
She's good!

20:07.953 --> 20:09.353
Oh no...

20:11.712 --> 20:13.532
Nightmare Moon!

20:15.089 --> 20:17.717
Oh, my beloved subjects!

20:17.868 --> 20:23.079
It's been so long since I've seen your
precious little sun-loving faces.

20:23.196 --> 20:25.334
What did you do with our Princess?!

20:25.730 --> 20:27.106
Whoa there, Nelly...!

20:29.147 --> 20:33.793
Why, am I not royal enough for you?
Don't you know who I am?

20:34.388 --> 20:35.380
More guessing games!

20:35.530 --> 20:38.722
Um... Pokey Smokes!
How about Queen Meanie?

20:38.723 --> 20:40.888
No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty...!

20:42.891 --> 20:48.276
Does my crown no longer count now that
I have been imprisoned for a thousand years?

20:48.347 --> 20:52.022
Did you not recall the legend?
Did you not see the signs?

20:52.051 --> 20:54.585
I did! And I know who you are!

20:54.586 --> 20:56.413
You're the Mare in the Moon.

20:56.414 --> 20:57.828
Nightmare Moon.

20:59.701 --> 21:03.211
Well well well. Somepony who remembers me.

21:03.212 --> 21:05.258
Then you also know why I'm here.

21:05.271 --> 21:07.547
You're here to... to...

21:10.840 --> 21:14.168
Remember this day, little ponies,
for it was your last.

21:14.446 --> 21:16.148
From this moment forth...

21:16.149 --> 21:19.503
THE NIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER!

21:30.587 --> 21:34.087
