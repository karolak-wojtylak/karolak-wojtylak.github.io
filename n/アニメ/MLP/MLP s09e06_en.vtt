00:02.969 --> 00:04.636
Announcer: Highlights in
the world of sports!

00:04.738 --> 00:06.906
Buckball fever has
swept Equestria.

00:07.008 --> 00:09.141
What started as a backyard
hobby for fruit farmers

00:09.243 --> 00:12.177
and the like has blossomed
into a literal phenomenon.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.846
With something for Everypony.

00:13.948 --> 00:16.281
Unicorns, Pegasi, and
Earth Ponies alike

00:16.383 --> 00:18.483
can't get enough of this
breakthrough sport.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.590
And with its popularity
still on the rise,

00:24.792 --> 00:27.026
Buckball fans want, nay demand,

00:27.128 --> 00:30.062
an institution catering
to their new obsession.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.431
And the ponies of Appleoosa
answered the call,

00:32.733 --> 00:34.333
delivering a
state-of-the-art locale

00:34.435 --> 00:37.036
where fans Equestria-over
can celebrate their passion:

00:37.238 --> 00:39.238
the Buckball Hall Of Fame!

00:39.440 --> 00:41.073
Though given the
game's recent nature,

00:41.175 --> 00:43.442
the only inductees so
far will be the members

00:43.544 --> 00:46.645
of the current championship
team from Ponyville!

00:47.848 --> 00:50.950
[whispering] Do you think they
know we're here?

00:51.052 --> 00:53.318
I think they have
a pretty good idea.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.389
A pretty good idea about what?

01:40.801 --> 01:42.968
Fluttershy: I can't believe
the ponies of Appleoosa

01:43.070 --> 01:44.770
built this place.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.539
Yeah! Especially after
their team lost to us.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.576
They must really love Buckball!

01:51.378 --> 01:55.280
Oh, my gosh! It's you! I
can't believe you're you!

01:55.382 --> 01:59.184
I mean here! I mean
Team Ponyville! Yahh!

01:59.286 --> 02:00.919
Yep. It's us.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.921
How much for an autograph?

02:03.323 --> 02:05.857
Bits for autographs, eh?

02:07.661 --> 02:10.162
Snails, you thinking
what I'm thinking?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.397
What's the sound of
one hoof clapping?

02:12.699 --> 02:15.000
Yeah! I mean, uh, no!

02:15.402 --> 02:18.537
How many of you would
pay for an autograph

02:18.639 --> 02:21.172
from my best friend, Snails!

02:25.312 --> 02:28.247
Wow. That's a lot of writing...

02:28.949 --> 02:31.683
I'm so proud they
decided to honor us.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.952
I never thought I'd
get to be in anything

02:34.054 --> 02:35.487
like a Hall of Fame.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.457
Me neither! Unless you
count a Royal Order

02:38.559 --> 02:40.058
of Party Planners
Memorial Library,

02:40.160 --> 02:42.628
which, heh, I don't, because
<i>every</i> party planner

02:42.730 --> 02:44.196
gets one of those eventually.

03:00.147 --> 03:01.680
Fluttershy: I hope
Snails finishes signing

03:01.782 --> 03:04.316
autographs soon. We
can't play without him

03:04.418 --> 03:06.084
and if we lose or
forfeit one game,

03:06.286 --> 03:07.987
we'll be out of
the tournament!

03:08.089 --> 03:10.589
Uch. Well, he'd better get
his flank over here then.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.157
You have to win
the first few games

03:12.259 --> 03:13.792
without me cheering you on.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.394
Oh! Why?

03:15.996 --> 03:17.896
Applejack was too busy to come,

03:17.998 --> 03:21.400
so she made me promise to go
to ALL the museum exhibits

03:21.502 --> 03:22.635
and tell her about them.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.369
I'm gonna try and get in
first and beat the crowd

03:24.471 --> 03:26.238
so I can get back to
the tournament faster.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.106
Ooh, then you'd
better hurry.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.841
It looks like there's
already a line!

03:29.943 --> 03:30.742
What!?

03:34.315 --> 03:36.315
The doors aren't
even open yet!

03:36.917 --> 03:40.185
What kind of sports fan
camps out for a museum?

03:40.287 --> 03:44.323
The real question is: what
kind of sports fan doesn't?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.391
[gasp] Quibble Pants!?

03:46.593 --> 03:49.328
Rainbow Dash! Fancy
meeting you here.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.830
Fancy meeting me?
I'm a sports pony!

03:51.932 --> 03:53.165
Of course I'd be here!

03:53.267 --> 03:55.767
What's fancy is
<i>you</i> being here...

03:56.069 --> 03:57.970
if fancy meant
confusing.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.672
There's nothing fancy
or confusing about it.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.742
You can't keep me away
from that.. that buckball rink.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.410
I'm the biggest
fan there is!

04:06.513 --> 04:10.215
Uh, it's a buckball
field. And, you are?

04:10.417 --> 04:14.686
Oh, sure! With all the
b-bucking and the balling...

04:14.788 --> 04:16.154
on the buckball field...

04:16.256 --> 04:18.323
Which is where they
play... buckball.

04:18.525 --> 04:21.526
I, I... I wanted to be
first inside to experience

04:21.628 --> 04:23.829
the.. <i>grand</i> history
of the sport.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.732
I.. I guess only a real fan
would understand that.

04:28.034 --> 04:28.934
Er.....

04:29.036 --> 04:30.603
Oh! Perfect timing.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.072
Rainbow Dash, I'd like
you to meet Clear Sky,

04:34.174 --> 04:36.775
the most amazing
pony I've ever met.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.077
Um, you've met Daring Do,

04:39.179 --> 04:42.647
so that's probably an
exaggeration. No offense.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.416
None taken. When it
comes to describing

04:44.518 --> 04:47.386
your special somepony, a
little exaggeration's normal.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.554
And I feel the
same way about you.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.691
And who is this?

04:52.893 --> 04:54.760
This is my daughter,
Wind Sprint.

04:54.862 --> 04:58.430
And she is pretty amazing too!

04:58.532 --> 05:00.465
Wind, did you thank
Quibble for camping out,

05:00.567 --> 05:01.800
so we'd be first in line?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.402
Thanks.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.904
No problem! I-I probably
would have done it anyway.

05:06.006 --> 05:10.208
I mean, I can't wait
to see the.... evolution

05:10.310 --> 05:12.944
of the buck basket
from farm to field!

05:13.046 --> 05:14.079
That.. that sounds just...

05:14.181 --> 05:17.316
I mean, wow! There
is a lot to see.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.854
I'd rather
see the game.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.923
Oh. Well, I mean,
sure. That makes sense.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.259
We could just go to the
tournament instead.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.828
No. Quibble planned
this whole thing for us

05:29.930 --> 05:32.431
and you.. could be a
little more appreciative.

05:37.138 --> 05:40.271
Heh. I kinda wanted to
skip the museum too.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.842
...BUT I promised a friend

05:43.944 --> 05:45.344
that I'd check out
all the exhibits.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.412
Ugh. All of them?

05:48.615 --> 05:50.415
You know, I'd like
a chance to catch up

05:50.517 --> 05:52.384
with Rainbow Dash.
Why don't we split up?

05:52.486 --> 05:54.753
We'll cover more
ground that way and...

05:57.925 --> 06:01.293
So... you and
Clear Sky, huh?

06:01.395 --> 06:05.697
Oh yeah. She's great. Honestly,
I've never been happier...

06:06.199 --> 06:07.800
which is why I need your help!

06:08.402 --> 06:10.336
I don't know what
any of this stuff is!

06:11.338 --> 06:12.537
What do you mean?

06:12.639 --> 06:15.307
See this? I don't
know what it is.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.642
A ball?

06:16.944 --> 06:19.344
Wh- And this? No idea!

06:19.446 --> 06:22.114
It's a basket. How do you
not know what these are?

06:22.216 --> 06:24.916
I'm not even 100% sure
what "bucking" is.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.252
I literally know
nothing about buckball,

06:27.454 --> 06:28.887
or any other sport!

06:29.089 --> 06:32.891
Well, I figured you weren't the
sportiest pony in Equestria.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.359
But Wind Sprint is!

06:34.461 --> 06:36.228
And her dad was some
big athlete too.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.463
I can't compete with that...

06:41.201 --> 06:43.235
I really want things with
Clear Sky to work out,

06:43.337 --> 06:46.104
but if Wind doesn't like
me, I might as well give up.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.157
Uh, why?

06:48.258 --> 06:50.775
They're a family. Even if
it's OK with Clear Sky,

06:50.877 --> 06:52.377
I wouldn't ask them to
make me a part of it

06:52.479 --> 06:54.012
if Wind Sprint isn't on board.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.518
I thought if I
could convince Wind

06:59.620 --> 07:00.952
I was a big buckball fan,

07:01.054 --> 07:02.038
we'd have something
to bond over,

07:02.139 --> 07:04.423
but.. I'm pretty sure
she's on to me.

07:04.525 --> 07:08.760
Here. Give it a shot. It's easy!

07:13.867 --> 07:15.901
Yeah, I don't think
she's fooled.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.304
Could.. could you talk to her?

07:19.506 --> 07:21.640
I mean, you're a
famous sports pony;

07:21.742 --> 07:22.908
you'd know what to say.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.244
Maybe.. you could
talk me up a little.

07:25.846 --> 07:29.314
Heh. No problem! I've
totally got your flank.

07:34.221 --> 07:38.190
Heh. Trust me. The game's a <i>lot</i>
harder to play with apples.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.791
You play..?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.660
Who do you think
taught them?

07:42.062 --> 07:43.895
Of course, being a
Wonderbolt takes up

07:43.997 --> 07:45.147
most of my time so,

07:45.248 --> 07:47.398
I don't get to practice
as much as I'd like.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.836
Wait. You're Rainbow
Dash, the Wonderbolt?

07:51.138 --> 07:53.539
Whoa! My dad was
a great flyer too.

07:53.941 --> 07:57.809
You don't say. You know,
Quibble's pretty sporty too.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.281
If you say so.

08:05.219 --> 08:07.185
I think I've seen
enough of this museum

08:07.287 --> 08:11.923
for <i>three</i> Applejacks. Let's
go watch some buckball!

08:12.025 --> 08:13.458
That sounds awesome!

08:13.560 --> 08:17.095
Oh! But first I got you
a little surprise...

08:18.899 --> 08:20.499
Oh. A book.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.936
Oh, not just a book,
it's a buckball <i>almanac</i>.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.571
This thing has
every buckball fact

08:26.673 --> 08:28.640
and statistic
ever recorded!

08:29.042 --> 08:29.875
Wow.

08:30.277 --> 08:30.977
I know!

08:31.078 --> 08:33.978
I never realized there was
so much math in buckball.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.680
I mean, this game's
got more numbers

08:35.782 --> 08:37.349
than Ogres & Oubliettes!

08:40.153 --> 08:41.153
Thanks?

08:41.555 --> 08:44.089
I.. I guess I could hold it for you.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.891
You know, so you don't
have to carry it.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.559
Can we go to the game now?

08:47.761 --> 08:48.727
Sure, honey.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.463
Listen, Q, this trip was a lovely idea
and the book was sweet but,

08:52.549 --> 08:54.132
you don't have
to try so hard.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.234
Everything's
going to be fine.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.639
Not even my presents
are in the ball court!

09:00.741 --> 09:02.641
Er. Do you mean ballpark?

09:02.743 --> 09:05.143
Do I? I don't know!
One thing's for sure,

09:05.245 --> 09:07.512
Wind is never going to
like a pony like me.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.048
Of course she will.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.317
She just needs to
see your sporty side.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.586
I don't <i>have</i> a sporty side.

09:14.688 --> 09:19.191
Everypony has a sporty side
and we're gonna find yours!

09:19.393 --> 09:22.594
By the end of the day,
I'm going to turn you into

09:22.696 --> 09:25.596
the sportiest pony
in Equestria!

09:33.373 --> 09:35.140
Look, I'm not saying
it's a terrible idea...

09:35.242 --> 09:36.975
but it's a terrible idea!

09:37.077 --> 09:39.545
You can't turn me into an
athlete. It's impossible!

09:40.147 --> 09:43.048
It's either that or be
yourself and bond with Wind

09:43.150 --> 09:46.017
over comic books and
role-playing games.

09:46.964 --> 09:47.964
Oo-Ah!

09:49.957 --> 09:53.625
Uh. I have a 17 charisma.
Don't you think I tried?

09:53.827 --> 09:55.594
She doesn't even like Daring Do.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.629
She thinks she's
not athletic enough!

09:58.031 --> 09:59.364
WHAT!? Wow.

09:59.466 --> 10:02.601
We need to get started on
operation sportify asap!

10:04.671 --> 10:06.972
To figure out what
your sporty side is,

10:07.174 --> 10:08.907
we just need to see
what your skills are.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.143
Everypony's got
something: Speed...

10:15.782 --> 10:16.782
Strength...

10:17.484 --> 10:18.517
Whoa!

10:18.819 --> 10:19.985
Agility!

10:20.487 --> 10:24.356
Heh. 'Course, some ponies
can do it all.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.992
You're amazing.
But what about me?

10:27.294 --> 10:30.295
Right. We should
probably start small.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.763
I'll pass the ball to you

10:31.865 --> 10:34.165
and you just pass
it back to me. OK?

10:34.267 --> 10:35.433
OK. Uh huh...

10:43.176 --> 10:44.909
and... buckball!

10:45.678 --> 10:46.378
Ow.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.315
OK... Maybe agility's
not your thing.

10:50.717 --> 10:51.283
Ready?

10:51.384 --> 10:53.250
If I say no, do I
still have to run?

10:53.353 --> 10:53.919
Yep.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.321
Can we get on with this?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.622
Snails and I did so well
with the autographs,

10:57.724 --> 10:59.624
we decided to expand,

10:59.926 --> 11:03.495
and these souvenirs are not
going to sell themselves.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.764
Remember. Think speed.

11:05.866 --> 11:06.565
Got it.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.300
On your marks... get set...

11:09.802 --> 11:12.804
Speed...Speeeeed

11:13.106 --> 11:13.605
Go!

11:14.574 --> 11:17.275
Speed! Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

11:17.377 --> 11:20.411
WHEW! OK! What a race! Right?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.950
Oh... so much for speed.

11:25.252 --> 11:28.687
This was fun, but I've
gotta get back to work!

11:30.323 --> 11:32.223
Come on, Quibble. You got this!

11:32.625 --> 11:36.561
I. Got. This...! I...

11:38.531 --> 11:40.899
This is hopeless! I
don't have any skills.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.133
Not agility. Not speed.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.804
I.. I can't even lift more than
one book, AND I LOVE BOOKS!

11:46.106 --> 11:48.707
If we had time to train,
I know I could mold you

11:48.809 --> 11:50.608
into the perfect sports pony.

11:52.846 --> 11:56.381
Eh. Or at least a <i>sportier</i> pony.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.183
Who knows how long
that would take?

11:58.585 --> 12:00.785
I need to get Wind
to like me NOW.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.759
Maybe you're not the best
athlete in Equestria,

12:07.861 --> 12:10.261
or the most coordinated,
or the fastest,

12:10.363 --> 12:12.563
or... even a little bit strong.

12:12.799 --> 12:15.732
I'm sorry, wait. Is this supposed to
be making me feel better?

12:15.835 --> 12:16.501
Because it's not.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.636
..BUT none of that matters

12:18.738 --> 12:21.506
because I just figured
out how to sportify you!

12:37.490 --> 12:40.525
And with that score, the
stars of Team Ponyville

12:40.627 --> 12:42.493
advance to the next round!

12:42.595 --> 12:44.028
If they keep winning like this,

12:44.130 --> 12:46.064
they'll never get off the field!

12:46.266 --> 12:49.367
Wow! The players from
Ponyville are so good!

12:49.469 --> 12:50.601
Q: They sure are!

12:50.703 --> 12:52.437
Quibble! Where
have you been?

12:52.739 --> 12:54.906
I was hoping we'd all watch
the tournament together.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.878
Oh, I've just been
arranging for us to hang out

12:59.980 --> 13:04.249
with a few of my close
friends... from Team Ponyville!

13:04.951 --> 13:06.817
That is, if
Wind's up for it.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.957
This is wonderful, Q,
but I still feel like

13:13.059 --> 13:15.326
you're trying too hard
to get Wind's approval.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.162
This is so great! Pinkie
Pie and Fluttershy

13:18.264 --> 13:20.164
are the best players out there!

13:20.266 --> 13:22.200
Well, you can
thank Quibble.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.202
Wonderbolts,
Buckball stars...

13:24.304 --> 13:26.704
He's friends with the
sportiest ponies around,

13:26.806 --> 13:29.508
so he must be pretty
sporty too, right?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.811
Pinkie: Ooooh. So this
is Quibble Pants.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.913
Rainbow Dash told us
all about how you two

13:35.015 --> 13:36.447
spent a whole
Daring Do Convention

13:36.549 --> 13:38.450
geeking out together
about books!

13:38.652 --> 13:40.418
And even though at
first, she thought you were

13:40.520 --> 13:42.854
the most annoying fan
pony she ever met,

13:42.956 --> 13:45.289
you two eventually
became friends!

13:46.559 --> 13:47.559
Uh...

13:47.661 --> 13:49.727
I guess even sports
ponies agree:

13:49.829 --> 13:52.463
Quibble's a pony you like
more and more over time!

13:53.165 --> 13:53.932
Agh!

13:54.034 --> 13:57.402
Knowing sports ponies isn't
the same as being one.

13:58.104 --> 14:01.340
What's it like playing in
front of all those fans?

14:02.242 --> 14:03.675
Um...

14:04.177 --> 14:05.676
I guess you'll find out!

14:05.878 --> 14:07.245
What do you mean?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.981
Yes. What <i>do</i> you mean?

14:10.083 --> 14:14.119
I think it's time we told Wind
about your next surprise.

14:14.921 --> 14:18.457
Q, Wind really doesn't
need any more surprises.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.625
Is it another book?

14:20.727 --> 14:21.793
Rainbow: A, books
are awesome,

14:21.895 --> 14:24.662
and B, this is way more
awesomer than that.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.965
For the tournament half-time
show, you and Quibble

14:27.067 --> 14:28.433
are gonna play a
game of buckball

14:28.535 --> 14:30.301
against Team
Ponyville!

14:30.603 --> 14:31.669
WE'RE WHAT!?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.958
Uh.. you should probably stretch.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.795
No amount of stretching
is going to make this OK.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.129
What were you thinking!?

14:58.231 --> 15:00.198
Look, you wanted to
impress Wind Sprint,

15:00.300 --> 15:01.450
and this just made sense.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.601
Really? How does me
making a fool of myself

15:03.703 --> 15:04.703
in front of her, Sky,

15:04.804 --> 15:07.104
and a billion buckball
fans make sense!?

15:07.207 --> 15:09.374
Don't worry, I've
got your flank.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.409
I already talked to
Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.478
They're totally going
to make you look good.

15:15.382 --> 15:19.450
Oh. OK. Maybe this isn't the
absolute worst idea ever.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.453
Announcer: Mares and
stallions, foals and colts.

15:22.555 --> 15:25.857
Put your hooves together for
today's halftime presentation

15:25.959 --> 15:29.460
as buckball's biggest stars
take on a team of fans

15:29.562 --> 15:30.928
just like you!

15:49.949 --> 15:52.784
Announcer: And that's one
for the Ponyville Champs.

15:52.986 --> 15:56.821
Looks like these fans don't
know what they signed up for.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.435
[haltingly fake] Oh, no,
Quibble's wide open

16:10.537 --> 16:13.237
and I'll never get
there in time to block...!

16:21.147 --> 16:23.481
Announcer: Ooooh! Looks
like our fan team

16:23.583 --> 16:25.550
needs to work on their passing.

16:40.466 --> 16:44.370
And the fan team finally
scores....!

16:44.571 --> 16:45.571
....for the other side.

16:45.972 --> 16:49.507
That makes three.
Team Ponyville wins!

16:52.712 --> 16:54.745
It says very clearly
on page six forty-seven

16:54.847 --> 16:56.915
of the expanded buckball
tournament rules

16:57.017 --> 16:59.417
that "a goal is scored when an
earth pony sends the ball

16:59.519 --> 17:02.753
into a basket," but it
doesn't say <i>which</i> basket!

17:02.855 --> 17:05.189
Yeah, I'm pretty
sure eveypony knows

17:05.291 --> 17:07.625
you're not supposed to score
in the other team's goal.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.827
But the rules don't say that.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.929
If that goal is
ours, it's only 2-1

17:12.031 --> 17:12.997
and we can keep playing.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.765
Wind: I don't want to!

17:14.967 --> 17:16.767
You're NOT a sports pony.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.337
It's NOT fun playing
this game with you.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.709
I was just trying to
get her to like me.

17:24.811 --> 17:28.046
I know! But I told you,
you didn't need to.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.381
You and I have to
rethink all of this.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.490
Rainbow: What are
you doing out here?

17:39.692 --> 17:41.692
Apparently, this book
is as close to sports

17:41.794 --> 17:42.778
as I'll ever get...

17:42.879 --> 17:45.263
Come on, that goal you
scored for the other team

17:45.365 --> 17:46.831
was amazing!

17:46.933 --> 17:49.233
Ugh. Thanks for trying, Rainbow Dash,

17:49.335 --> 17:50.501
but I think we can both agree

17:50.603 --> 17:54.105
the whole sportify
idea was a big flop.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.841
What!? We haven't
even gotten started!

17:56.943 --> 17:59.377
I've got, like, seven
more top notch ideas

17:59.479 --> 18:01.879
to turn you into a
super sporty pony!

18:03.249 --> 18:05.716
Wind's already made up
her mind and so have I.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.418
It's time to throw up the towel.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.788
It's "throw in the towel",
and that's ridiculous!

18:10.990 --> 18:12.256
You can't just give up!

18:12.358 --> 18:14.359
Wind and Sky deserve
a pony they both like

18:14.461 --> 18:17.261
in their lives. Besides, Sky
wants to "rethink" things,

18:17.363 --> 18:19.397
so I'm just beating
her to the lunch.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.866
It's "beating her
to the punch."

18:21.968 --> 18:23.834
And it's barely a
sports reference.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.503
How do you not know that?

18:25.705 --> 18:32.110
Because I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT SPORTS!

18:33.246 --> 18:36.047
And pretending I did
just made things worse.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.449
So you should
stop pretending.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.319
Look, you are
<i>terrible</i> at sports.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.288
You're uncoordinated,
slow, weak...

18:44.390 --> 18:47.425
OK, again, not really
making me feel better.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.927
And you're completely
clueless about anything

18:50.029 --> 18:51.429
having to do
with athletics,

18:51.631 --> 18:53.264
but maybe I'M not the pony

18:53.366 --> 18:54.900
you should have
come to for help...

18:56.002 --> 18:56.701
Oh!

18:58.338 --> 19:00.405
I wish we didn't even come here.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.073
Quibble thought you'd like it.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.843
Well, I don't. And
I don't like him.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.577
Why do you like him?

19:06.779 --> 19:09.147
Because he's kind and smart

19:09.249 --> 19:10.781
and his friends certainly
seem to care about him,

19:10.883 --> 19:12.317
which is always a good sign.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.520
I don't care how many
ponies care about him;

19:15.622 --> 19:18.123
they're not going to
make me forget about Dad.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.592
Oh, sweetheart, I know
Quibble's trying too hard,

19:21.694 --> 19:23.728
but he doesn't want you
to stop loving your dad;

19:23.930 --> 19:25.564
he just wants you to like <i>him</i>.

19:26.066 --> 19:27.898
And I think maybe there's
enough room in your heart

19:28.000 --> 19:29.100
to do both.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.235
Hey there.
Glad I found you

19:31.337 --> 19:32.703
because I have a
confession to make.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.438
I... know it's hard to imagine,

19:34.540 --> 19:37.308
but I'm not really
all that sporty.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.244
[gasp] No...!

19:39.646 --> 19:41.878
I'm sorry I was trying so hard
to convince you otherwise.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.913
I just really wanted
us to get along,

19:44.016 --> 19:46.184
but I guess it backfired...

19:46.286 --> 19:47.853
Do you think we
could start over?

19:49.155 --> 19:51.221
Maybe we could watch some
of the tournament together and..

19:51.323 --> 19:53.191
you could teach
me some sports stuff?

20:01.234 --> 20:03.334
OK, that's their goal.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.503
I'll try to remember
that if I ever decide

20:05.605 --> 20:09.107
to play buckball again,
but I probably won't.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.741
Oh, look. Pinkie
Pie's going to flip

20:10.843 --> 20:12.577
and triple bounce the
ball into the goal.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.748
How did you know that!?

20:17.950 --> 20:18.983
It's right here.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.785
Pinkie flips and
triple bounce-bucks

20:20.887 --> 20:23.754
over 83% of her shots
from the northwest section

20:23.856 --> 20:26.324
of the field when the wind
is blowing from the east.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.360
Huh. I guess this book's
kind of cool after all.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.597
Look, Sky, I know
you're thinking

20:33.699 --> 20:36.267
of calling it quits between
us, and after today,

20:36.369 --> 20:37.535
I don't blame you,

20:37.637 --> 20:39.704
but Wind and I just
made a connection!

20:39.806 --> 20:42.173
Calling it quits? What
are you talking about?

20:42.275 --> 20:44.675
You.. said you wanted
to rethink things.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.944
Yeah, things like
having your friend

20:47.046 --> 20:48.979
help you pretend
to be a sports pony

20:49.081 --> 20:50.481
so Wind would like you.

20:50.883 --> 20:55.254
Wha..? [stuttering] Oh! I didn't.. What?

20:56.656 --> 21:00.925
Wha..? Me? Nah!

21:01.127 --> 21:03.294
Mom, look what
Quibble showed me!

21:03.396 --> 21:05.963
When Fluttershy flies higher
than the other Pegasus,

21:06.165 --> 21:10.234
Pinkie scores 92% of the
time! And it just happened.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.002
Wow! You'd better watch out

21:12.104 --> 21:13.704
or you're gonna
start to like books.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.840
I guess that wouldn't be so bad.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.710
Huh. Looks like you
didn't need sportiness,

21:19.812 --> 21:21.445
famous ponies, or lavish gifts

21:21.547 --> 21:23.014
to bond with Wind after all.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.549
Technically, he still
needed to buy her the book,

21:25.651 --> 21:26.917
but that's it.
