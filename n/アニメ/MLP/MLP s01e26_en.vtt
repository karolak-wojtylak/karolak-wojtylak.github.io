WEBVTT

00:03.325 --> 00:09.003
I... can't... believe... the Grand...
Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!

00:10.239 --> 00:13.345
Pinkie! Please stop shouting.
I'm trying to concentrate.

00:14.847 --> 00:17.053
Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now.

00:17.054 --> 00:20.655
It's time to prepare for the Gala and I refuse to
let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.

00:25.783 --> 00:27.129
What's Twilight doing?

00:27.321 --> 00:30.251
She's got an awesome magic spell
she's been working on for the Gala.

00:30.511 --> 00:32.310
Where are the others? It's getting late.

00:32.315 --> 00:34.342
Hold your horses, girl. We're here.

00:34.825 --> 00:36.440
Perfect! I'm ready.

00:36.621 --> 00:37.449
For what?

00:37.450 --> 00:38.603
All right, Spike.

00:39.381 --> 00:40.267
An apple!

00:40.268 --> 00:41.531
Are we having pie?

00:41.575 --> 00:43.120
Shh! Watch!

00:51.714 --> 00:53.814
Thanks. But that's just the start.

00:54.022 --> 00:55.953
Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?

00:55.954 --> 00:56.832
Yes.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.909
Will they be safe, Twilight?

00:59.121 --> 01:00.345
You have my word.

01:05.740 --> 01:07.159
Ta-da!

01:12.722 --> 01:16.582
Neat, huh? And don't worry.
They'll be mice again at midnight.

01:16.676 --> 01:17.875
Opalescence, no!

01:21.588 --> 01:23.142
Wait! Come back!

01:23.252 --> 01:27.142
Those horses were supposed to
pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.810
What ever shall we do?

01:33.571 --> 01:35.818
Uh... ahem. Excuse me.

01:35.819 --> 01:38.939
Uh, would you boys mind
pulling our carriage to the Gala?

01:40.202 --> 01:41.595
Oh. Yeah.

01:42.070 --> 01:42.989
Right.

02:27.090 --> 02:28.560
Come on, you guys.

02:28.735 --> 02:29.938
Let me in!

02:30.082 --> 02:31.166
Sure thing, Spike.

02:31.344 --> 02:33.505
Heavens no! We're getting dressed.

02:33.884 --> 02:38.055
Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh...
we don't normally wear clothes.

02:40.516 --> 02:43.906
I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards.

02:44.189 --> 02:46.597
I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight.

02:46.598 --> 02:47.717
Our home town, Twilight!

02:47.887 --> 02:51.721
And he best part is that we all get to
hang out together all night long!

02:52.025 --> 02:53.890
Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.

02:56.561 --> 02:57.767
We'll just have to see.

03:00.078 --> 03:02.072
We're gonna be a mite busy.

03:03.173 --> 03:05.006
Busy having fun!

03:06.694 --> 03:08.686
Oh. Okay.

03:09.634 --> 03:12.810
Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to
spend some time together.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.014
Great!

03:14.882 --> 03:17.349
Cause I planned out my
insider's tour of Canterlot.

03:17.478 --> 03:21.260
I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels.
And Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree.

03:21.261 --> 03:23.917
And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop.

03:28.939 --> 03:30.988
Then let's get moving! Hyah!

03:31.211 --> 03:32.700
Excuse me!?

03:32.820 --> 03:34.474
Um... I...

03:34.475 --> 03:37.246
If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity...

04:02.252 --> 04:03.287
Wow!

04:05.199 --> 04:06.502
You all look...

04:07.071 --> 04:08.554
...amazing!

04:09.402 --> 04:11.277
I can't believe we're finally here!

04:11.377 --> 04:15.048
With all that we've imagined, the reality
of this night is sure to make this...

04:15.193 --> 04:17.067
...the best night ever!

04:17.286 --> 04:19.144
<i>At the Gala!
(At the Gala!)</i>

04:19.244 --> 04:21.232
<i>At the Gala
In the garden</i>

04:21.233 --> 04:23.320
<i>I'm going to see them all</i>

04:23.321 --> 04:26.674
<i>All the creatures
I'll befriend them at the Gala</i>

04:26.675 --> 04:27.541
<i>At the Gala!</i>

04:27.590 --> 04:29.583
<i>All the birdies
And the critters</i>

04:29.584 --> 04:31.775
<i>They will love me, big and small</i>

04:31.776 --> 04:33.975
<i>We'll become good friends forever</i>

04:33.976 --> 04:36.353
<i>Right here at the Gala</i>

04:36.354 --> 04:38.360
<i>All our dreams will come true</i>

04:38.361 --> 04:42.204
<i>Right here at the Gala! At the Gala!</i>

04:42.205 --> 04:44.397
<i>At the Gala (It's amazing!)
I will sell them (Better hurry!)</i>

04:44.398 --> 04:46.448
<i>All my appletastic treats (Yummy, yummy!)</i>

04:46.449 --> 04:48.533
<i>Hungry ponies (They'll be snacking!)
They will buy them (Bringing money!)</i>

04:48.534 --> 04:50.643
<i>Caramel apples, apple sweets (Give me some!)</i>

04:50.644 --> 04:52.665
<i>And I'll earn a lot of money</i>

04:52.666 --> 04:55.190
<i>For the Apple family</i>

04:55.191 --> 04:59.172
<i>All our dreams and our hopes
From now until hereafter</i>

04:59.173 --> 05:05.102
<i>All that we've been wishing for
Will happen at the Gala! At the Gala!</i>

05:05.103 --> 05:07.354
<i>At the Gala
All the royals</i>

05:07.355 --> 05:09.423
<i>They will meet fair Rarity</i>

05:09.424 --> 05:12.599
<i>They will see I'm just as regal at the Gala</i>

05:12.600 --> 05:13.523
<i>At the Gala!</i>

05:13.524 --> 05:15.550
<i>I will find him
My Prince Charming</i>

05:15.551 --> 05:17.792
<i>And how gallant he will be</i>

05:17.793 --> 05:20.068
<i>He will treat me like a lady</i>

05:20.069 --> 05:22.337
<i>Tonight at the Gala</i>

05:22.338 --> 05:26.267
<i>This is what we've waited for
To have the best night ever</i>

05:26.268 --> 05:32.283
<i>Each of us will live our dreams
Tonight at the Gala! At the Gala!</i>

05:37.884 --> 05:40.159
<i>I've been dreaming
I've been waiting</i>

05:40.160 --> 05:42.340
<i>To fly with those great ponies</i>

05:42.341 --> 05:44.542
<i>The Wonderbolts
Their daring tricks</i>

05:44.543 --> 05:46.498
<i>Spinning round and having kicks</i>

05:46.499 --> 05:48.501
<i>Perform for crowds of thousands</i>

05:48.502 --> 05:50.544
<i>They'll shower us with diamonds</i>

05:50.545 --> 05:54.672
<i>The Wonderbolts will see me
Right here at the Gala</i>

05:54.673 --> 05:58.677
<i>All we've come for, all we've dreamed
Our "happy ever after"</i>

05:58.678 --> 06:04.557
<i>Finally they'll all come true
Right here at the Grand Gala! At the Gala!</i>

06:04.558 --> 06:06.713
<i>I am here at the Grand Gala</i>

06:06.714 --> 06:08.718
<i>For it is the best party</i>

06:08.719 --> 06:10.694
<i>But the one thing it was missing</i>

06:10.695 --> 06:12.880
<i>Was a pony named Pinkie</i>

06:13.059 --> 06:14.960
<i>For I am the best at parties</i>

06:14.961 --> 06:17.012
<i>All the ponies will agree</i>

06:17.013 --> 06:19.348
<i>Ponies playing, ponies dancing</i>

06:19.349 --> 06:21.757
<i>With me at the Grand Gala</i>

06:21.758 --> 06:25.441
<i>Happiness and laughter at the Gala! At the Gala!</i>

06:29.744 --> 06:31.811
<i>At the Gala (At the Gala!)
With the Princess (With the Princess!)</i>

06:31.812 --> 06:33.926
<i>Is where I'm going to be (She will be!)</i>

06:33.927 --> 06:36.013
<i>We will talk all about magic</i>

06:36.014 --> 06:38.220
<i>And what I've learned and seen (She will see!)</i>

06:38.221 --> 06:40.168
<i>It is going to be so special</i>

06:40.169 --> 06:42.568
<i>As she takes time just for me</i>

06:42.569 --> 06:46.624
<i>This will be the best night ever!</i>

06:46.625 --> 06:50.800
<i>Into the Gala we must go
We're ready, now we're all aglow</i>

06:50.801 --> 06:55.172
<i>Into the Gala let's go in
And have the best night ever</i>

06:55.173 --> 06:59.181
<i>Into the Gala, now's the time
We're ready and we look divine</i>

06:59.182 --> 07:01.343
<i>Into the Gala
Meet new friends</i>

07:01.344 --> 07:03.498
<i>Into the Gala
Sell some apples</i>

07:03.499 --> 07:05.456
<i>Into the Gala
Find my prince</i>

07:05.457 --> 07:07.427
<i>Prove I'm great
As the Wonderbolt is</i>

07:07.428 --> 07:10.670
<i>To meet, to sell, to find, to prove, to whoop, to talk</i>

07:11.026 --> 07:15.110
<i>Into the Gala!
Into the Gala!</i>

07:15.415 --> 07:22.119
<i>And we'll have the best night ever!</i>

07:23.896 --> 07:25.071
<i>At the Gala!</i>

07:25.840 --> 07:28.005
Yeah! This is gonna be the best night ever.

07:28.006 --> 07:30.753
You know why? Cause we're all gonna
spend time at the Gala to...

07:33.402 --> 07:33.994
...gether.

07:35.130 --> 07:35.842
Or not.

07:45.602 --> 07:47.232
Princess Celestia!

07:47.781 --> 07:51.356
Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.

07:51.673 --> 07:53.419
Oh, I'm so excited to be here!

07:53.420 --> 07:55.319
We have so much to catch up on.

07:55.449 --> 07:58.261
Well, I want you right by
my side the entire evening...

07:58.262 --> 07:59.913
...so we'll have plenty of time together.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.291
That's just what I was hoping you'd say.

08:13.836 --> 08:14.795
Hurry, Rarity...

08:14.796 --> 08:15.915
Oh, but not too fast.

08:16.103 --> 08:17.223
But don't wanna lose him...

08:17.224 --> 08:17.877
WAIT!

08:17.878 --> 08:19.188
Have to play it cool.

08:19.189 --> 08:20.570
Oh, but don't be cold!

08:20.585 --> 08:23.467
I can't lose him, I can't!
He's everything I imagined!

08:26.561 --> 08:28.623
Even better than I imagined.

08:35.206 --> 08:37.614
Oh my! A meadowlark!

08:41.714 --> 08:43.654
I think she's calling to me.

08:44.008 --> 08:46.111
It's exactly what I wished for!

08:58.849 --> 09:00.690
Howdy, partner! You hungry?

09:00.923 --> 09:02.363
As a horse!

09:02.748 --> 09:04.284
Well, what's you're hungering for?

09:04.285 --> 09:07.011
Caramel apple? Apple pie?
Apple fritter? Apple fries?

09:07.435 --> 09:09.538
I'll take that big apple pie!

09:09.764 --> 09:11.401
Well, thank you kindly, sir!

09:12.024 --> 09:14.332
Yeehaw! In the first minute.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.855
I made my first sale. Just like I expected.

09:22.269 --> 09:24.667
Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soarin'?

09:25.010 --> 09:25.837
Yeah!

09:27.597 --> 09:30.115
Mmmyyy pppiiieee!

09:33.005 --> 09:35.395
You saved it! Thanks.

09:35.795 --> 09:37.190
Hey, no prob.

09:38.216 --> 09:39.647
Hey! I know you.

09:39.954 --> 09:43.545
You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale
and won The Best Flyer Competition.

09:43.665 --> 09:46.160
Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.

09:46.161 --> 09:49.723
Well, Rainbow Dash.
Looks like your skills saved us again.

09:49.724 --> 09:52.600
Oh, at least they saved Soarin's apple pie.

09:53.634 --> 09:54.109
Yeah...

09:56.464 --> 09:57.698
Wanna come hang out with us?

09:57.699 --> 09:59.078
Sure. Why not?

10:01.380 --> 10:05.311
I'm... hanging... with the... Wonderbolts!

10:10.844 --> 10:12.388
The shiny dance floor...

10:12.923 --> 10:14.513
The pretty party ponies...

10:15.052 --> 10:16.217
The fancy band...

10:16.218 --> 10:19.276
Shiny! Pretty! Fancy!

10:21.448 --> 10:22.417
GOTTA DANCE!

10:23.190 --> 10:26.661
<i>I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala</i>

10:26.662 --> 10:29.182
<i>I'm at the Grand Galloping Gaalaaa!</i>

10:29.183 --> 10:30.778
<i>It's all I ever dreamed</i>

10:31.001 --> 10:34.311
<i>It's all I ever dreamed! Woohoo!
It's all I ever dreamed! Yippee!</i>

10:34.312 --> 10:38.643
<i>I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaAAAA!</i>

10:43.225 --> 10:46.247
It's all I've ever... dreamed?

10:50.189 --> 10:51.317
Well, hello.

10:51.716 --> 10:53.774
I am Prince Blueblood.

10:54.476 --> 10:56.029
I am... Rarity.

10:56.392 --> 10:58.538
Oh my, what a lovely rose.

10:58.539 --> 10:59.411
You mean...

11:00.680 --> 11:01.633
...this rose?

11:04.558 --> 11:07.028
Thank you. It goes with my eyes.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.684
My little meadowlark is right around this bend!

11:20.189 --> 11:21.243
Was that you?

11:21.537 --> 11:24.019
Yep! I love whistlin' while I work.

11:26.050 --> 11:29.365
Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.

11:31.181 --> 11:31.845
Oh!

11:32.047 --> 11:35.511
I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey!

11:35.844 --> 11:38.163
And, oh! Is that a wallaroo?

11:39.930 --> 11:43.076
Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.

11:53.445 --> 11:55.039
Hey, Spitfire!

11:55.458 --> 11:57.909
You ever done a rain cloud double backflip?

12:00.619 --> 12:03.660
You ever soared past lighting? It's awesome!

12:09.957 --> 12:12.133
Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.

12:13.454 --> 12:16.007
Princess! I've been so excited
to spend time with you and...

12:16.008 --> 12:18.449
Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh, good evening!

12:18.450 --> 12:19.621
Welcome to the Gala.

12:20.887 --> 12:21.922
...which is why I...

12:21.923 --> 12:24.902
Ladies! Lovely to see you again.

12:27.918 --> 12:32.227
Looks like getting a chance to talk to
the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.

12:34.495 --> 12:36.136
First minute, first sale.

12:36.885 --> 12:37.805
Second...

12:38.184 --> 12:39.116
Fourth...

12:39.614 --> 12:40.515
Sixth...

12:40.536 --> 12:43.160
Sixtieth minute... no sales.

12:44.044 --> 12:46.444
This ain't what I expected at all.

12:48.065 --> 12:51.484
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala...

12:52.301 --> 12:54.563
...and it's not what I dreamed.

12:58.594 --> 13:01.223
This isn't at all what I imagined.

13:08.114 --> 13:09.765
This isn't what I hoped.

13:12.463 --> 13:14.061
This isn't hanging out.

13:16.709 --> 13:18.845
This isn't what I wished for.

13:19.746 --> 13:20.494
No!

13:20.495 --> 13:22.165
I waited all my life...

13:22.166 --> 13:23.177
...for this moment.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.689
And I'm not going to...

13:24.690 --> 13:25.783
...let it slip by.

13:25.784 --> 13:27.822
If it's the last thing I do...

13:27.823 --> 13:29.453
...I'm gonna make this...

13:29.869 --> 13:32.073
...the best night ever!

13:34.689 --> 13:37.966
I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.912
I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends!

13:42.913 --> 13:47.370
But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!

13:51.167 --> 13:51.939
Gotcha!

13:52.139 --> 13:55.135
It's okay. I promise not to hurt you.
I just wanna be your...

13:57.473 --> 13:58.237
...friend?

13:58.402 --> 14:00.225
Mmm... Sounds good to me.

14:04.807 --> 14:05.857
Come on, Rainbow!

14:06.026 --> 14:08.718
If they don't notice you,
you gotta make them notice you.

14:32.482 --> 14:34.119
Just give him a chance, Rarity.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.955
His princely side is sure to come out
if you're just patient.

14:37.020 --> 14:38.858
Miss Rarity! Stop!

14:40.042 --> 14:40.470
Oh.

14:40.700 --> 14:43.623
Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.196
One would hate to slip.

14:45.197 --> 14:47.431
Yes. "One" certainly would.

14:47.657 --> 14:49.954
One's cloak should take care of the problem.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.765
Oh, of course it will.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.834
Come on everypony!

15:14.835 --> 15:17.539
I know what will make you
shake those groove-thangs!

15:19.113 --> 15:23.077
<i>You reach your right hoof in
You reach your right hoof out</i>

15:23.078 --> 15:26.712
<i>You reach your right hoof in
And you shake it all about</i>

15:26.713 --> 15:30.518
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
Meeting lots of folks with clout</i>

15:30.519 --> 15:33.184
<i>That's what I'm talking about</i>

15:33.707 --> 15:37.688
<i>You step your left hoof in
You pull it right back out</i>

15:37.689 --> 15:41.165
<i>You step your left hoof in
But you better help him out</i>

15:41.166 --> 15:44.998
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
But you'd find a different route</i>

15:44.999 --> 15:47.602
<i>That's what it's all about</i>

15:48.355 --> 15:52.196
<i>You kick your back leg in
You pull your back leg out</i>

15:52.197 --> 15:55.851
<i>You reach your back leg in
Just be brave and have no doubt</i>

15:55.852 --> 15:59.600
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
Feeling like you're gonna pout</i>

15:59.601 --> 16:02.274
<i>That's what I'm singing about</i>

16:02.893 --> 16:06.780
<i>You tilt your head in
You tilt your head out</i>

16:06.781 --> 16:10.340
<i>You tilt your head in
Then you shake it all about</i>

16:10.341 --> 16:14.000
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
Even though your date's a lout</i>

16:14.001 --> 16:16.653
<i>You're better off without</i>

16:17.442 --> 16:21.398
<i>You stomp your whole self in
You stomp your whole self out</i>

16:21.399 --> 16:24.939
<i>You stomp your whole self in
And you stomp yourself about</i>

16:24.940 --> 16:28.143
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
And you give a little shout</i>

16:28.144 --> 16:28.989
COME OUT!

16:28.990 --> 16:31.349
<i>That's what I'm talking about</i>

16:32.223 --> 16:35.771
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
You do the Pony Pokey</i>

16:36.024 --> 16:40.526
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
And that's what it's all about</i>

16:40.527 --> 16:41.603
YEAH!

16:41.956 --> 16:45.463
Young lady, this is not *that* kind of partay.

16:46.971 --> 16:49.253
Ooooooh...

16:49.283 --> 16:50.723
They don't want a party.

16:50.816 --> 16:53.911
These ponies want a paaartaaay!

16:55.625 --> 16:57.223
Two apple fritters, please.

16:57.534 --> 16:59.549
Two apple fritters comin' right up.

16:59.550 --> 17:00.547
That'll be four bits.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.929
I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?

17:09.371 --> 17:10.426
It's okay, Rarity.

17:10.427 --> 17:11.472
I got you covered.

17:12.734 --> 17:16.885
Thank you, Applejack. At least
somepony here has good manners.

17:20.867 --> 17:21.521
Oh!

17:21.812 --> 17:24.669
Fritters! Dumplings! Caramel apples!

17:24.670 --> 17:27.985
My royal lips have touched common carnival fare!

17:28.564 --> 17:31.279
I'm going to the buffet for
some... hors d'oeuvres.

17:32.688 --> 17:35.038
Well, no wonder nopony wants my food.

17:35.039 --> 17:37.599
They're fillin' up on all those
fancy-schmancy vittles.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.817
Well, my down-home apples are
plenty good enough for this crowd.

17:40.996 --> 17:43.322
I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.946
I'll catch you yet, my pretties.

17:47.947 --> 17:53.339
Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds
or monkeys or bears touches this net...

17:53.340 --> 17:55.786
...you'll be MINE! MINE!!!

18:05.697 --> 18:06.730
Come on, everypony!

18:07.365 --> 18:08.953
You wanted a partay?

18:08.954 --> 18:11.096
Now it's paaartaaay!

18:12.079 --> 18:12.838
Yeah!

18:13.400 --> 18:14.623
Now that's a beat, yeah!

18:15.054 --> 18:16.139
C'mon, dance!

18:17.757 --> 18:19.415
Yeah, woohoo!

18:20.423 --> 18:22.902
Okay, all you high-class ponies.

18:23.074 --> 18:28.026
Here's a highfalutin apple cake for
all your hoity-toity taste buds.

18:28.330 --> 18:30.547
STAGE DIVE!

18:40.006 --> 18:43.839
You, sir, are the most UNCHARMING
prince I have EVER MET!

18:43.840 --> 18:47.079
Seems like the only thing royal about you
is that you are a ROYAL PAIN!

18:47.080 --> 18:47.626
Ewww...!

18:47.627 --> 18:50.688
Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed!

18:50.689 --> 18:53.122
Afraid to get DIRTY?!

19:00.155 --> 19:01.487
This is my chance!

19:05.101 --> 19:06.073
Yes!

19:26.319 --> 19:28.527
Well... it can't get any worse.

19:33.527 --> 19:36.738
You're... going to LOVE ME!!!

19:44.257 --> 19:44.845
Run.

19:55.529 --> 19:57.361
Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper!

19:57.362 --> 19:59.355
Now your prince is sure to find you.

20:00.041 --> 20:00.588
No!

20:02.207 --> 20:03.072
Let's go!

20:06.098 --> 20:08.764
Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut.

20:08.893 --> 20:10.433
Don't you think you've had enough?

20:10.434 --> 20:13.007
Another donut! Extra sprinkles!

20:14.256 --> 20:17.077
Twilight Sparkle! Ha, ha.

20:17.078 --> 20:18.387
Long time no see.

20:18.638 --> 20:21.295
Hey, how was the Gala?
How was your best night ever?

20:22.737 --> 20:25.119
That sounds like the worst night ever!

20:25.120 --> 20:26.620
It was!

20:29.797 --> 20:33.435
I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset
at us for ruining the Gala.

20:33.610 --> 20:37.168
That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!

20:37.216 --> 20:39.058
Princess Celestia?!

20:39.357 --> 20:40.975
Pardon me, Princess...

20:41.384 --> 20:43.754
...but tonight was just awful.

20:43.765 --> 20:47.570
Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala
is always awful.

20:47.754 --> 20:48.680
It is?

20:48.703 --> 20:51.161
That is why I was thrilled you were all attending.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.615
I was hoping you could liven things up a bit.

20:53.742 --> 20:56.336
And while the evening may not
have gone as you planned...

20:56.337 --> 20:58.424
...I'm sure you'll agree that in the end...

20:58.425 --> 21:00.703
...it didn't turn out so bad
for this group of friends.

21:00.903 --> 21:02.288
You're right, Princess.

21:02.401 --> 21:06.676
Friends have a way of making even the worst
of times into something pretty great.

21:06.677 --> 21:08.556
Yeah! Hanging out with friends!

21:08.649 --> 21:10.750
-Talking!
-Laughing!

21:10.884 --> 21:14.551
You mean doing exactly what
I wanted to do the whole time?

21:14.552 --> 21:16.548
Yes, Spike. You were right.

21:16.665 --> 21:18.841
As horrible as our night was...

21:18.842 --> 21:21.603
...being together here has made it all better.

21:21.604 --> 21:23.598
In fact, it's made it...

21:23.599 --> 21:26.004
...the best night ever!

21:30.030 --> 21:33.530
