00:04.682 --> 00:07.822
Wow! I can't believe how
many ponies showed up.

00:08.152 --> 00:08.778
<i>I can.</i>

00:08.856 --> 00:10.948
<i>I mean, finding out who</i>
<i>the Ponyville Days</i>

00:10.954 --> 00:13.170
<i>Pony of Ceremonies is,</i>
<i>is a pretty big deal.</i>

00:15.960 --> 00:18.366
I didn't know Granny Smith was
on the Selection Committee.

00:18.696 --> 00:19.672
Of course she is.

00:20.005 --> 00:22.456
<i>Ponyville Days celebrates</i>
<i>the founding of Ponyville</i>

00:22.749 --> 00:24.267
<i>and she was right there.</i>

00:24.567 --> 00:26.241
I'm glad the Committee didn't
automatically pick me

00:26.253 --> 00:27.465
so everypony gets
a chance to see

00:27.477 --> 00:28.720
how great being
me actually is,

00:28.852 --> 00:30.423
even though the Festival
is basically a party

00:30.433 --> 00:32.109
and the Pony of Ceremonies
organizes the whole thing

00:32.115 --> 00:33.738
so it would make
sense if they picked me.

00:33.744 --> 00:34.655
Shhhhhh!

00:35.681 --> 00:37.168
Citizens of Ponyville,

00:37.477 --> 00:40.284
this year's applicants
were all exceptional,

00:40.536 --> 00:43.135
but there can only be
one Ponyville Days

00:43.149 --> 00:44.866
Pony of Ceremonies.

00:45.205 --> 00:47.336
And that pony is...

00:56.329 --> 00:57.283
Rarity!

00:57.438 --> 00:59.890
<i>Whoo whee!</i>
<i>All right, Rarity!</i>

01:02.296 --> 01:03.662
Congratulations, Rarity.

01:03.929 --> 01:05.053
Do you know what
you're going to do?

01:10.263 --> 01:13.295
Oh, I might have a few ideas.

01:20.663 --> 01:25.660

01:57.890 --> 02:00.712
I'm so excited for the Festival
I can hardly stand up straight.

02:02.370 --> 02:04.667
Me, too. I'm glad
Rarity was picked.

02:04.993 --> 02:07.445
I know she'll add a touch of
elegance to the whole thing.

02:07.666 --> 02:09.147
Probably more than a touch.

02:17.096 --> 02:17.906
Ahem.

02:19.631 --> 02:23.055
This year's Ponyville Days
Festival designed by Rarity,

02:23.326 --> 02:26.696
will feature various high
class events, such as...

02:27.980 --> 02:30.638
<i>A silent cider</i>
<i>auction and tasting...</i>

02:30.641 --> 02:32.439
Ooooh!

02:32.565 --> 02:35.102
<i>A Ponyville gala</i>
<i>in Town Square...</i>

02:35.377 --> 02:36.907
<i>Aaaaah!</i>

02:36.995 --> 02:40.538
<i>And, of course, a</i>
<i>Ponyville fashion show.</i>

02:40.757 --> 02:42.261
<i>Ooooooh!</i>

02:42.273 --> 02:46.316
This year's Ponyville Days
Festival pony of ceremonies,

02:46.577 --> 02:49.994
creates shimmering
couture of her own design.

02:51.765 --> 02:54.292
And the theme is,

02:55.051 --> 02:58.314
Small Town Chic!

02:59.678 --> 03:03.307
Wow, Rarity! You really have
put a lot of effort into this.

03:03.568 --> 03:04.310
I'll say.

03:05.492 --> 03:07.666
I think it's going
to be magical.

03:08.515 --> 03:09.695
Do you really think so?

03:10.160 --> 03:11.941
Are you kidding?
I can't wait!

03:12.366 --> 03:13.980
Oh, that's such a relief.

03:14.197 --> 03:16.665
But, of course, I couldn't
possibly do it all on my own.

03:16.995 --> 03:19.221
The festival is in three days!

03:19.397 --> 03:21.484
Pinkie Pie and I can hang
lights and decorations

03:21.494 --> 03:22.450
in the Town Square.

03:22.513 --> 03:25.750
And I can get Sweet Apple Acres
all ready for the cider tasting.

03:26.755 --> 03:27.908
That's just perfect.

03:28.306 --> 03:30.979
And now Twilight, if you and
Fluttershy wouldn't mind helping

03:30.989 --> 03:32.111
with the fashion show...

03:32.226 --> 03:33.201
Of course.

03:33.295 --> 03:34.220
I'd be honored.

03:34.396 --> 03:37.381
I can focus on the one thing
I'm worried about most of all.

03:37.859 --> 03:38.735
<i>What?</i>

03:39.231 --> 03:41.484
Creating a Ponyville
Days Festival

03:41.705 --> 03:43.480
fantastic enough to impress...

03:44.259 --> 03:45.278
TRENDERHOOF!

03:50.142 --> 03:51.877
Uh, who's Trenderhoof?

03:52.271 --> 03:52.680
WHAT?

03:53.223 --> 03:55.520
How can you not know
who Trenderhoof is?

03:56.329 --> 03:58.599
Trenderhoof is only
the most amazing,

03:58.753 --> 04:01.957
handsomest travel writer to
have ever traveled or written.

04:02.351 --> 04:05.053
Before Las Pegasus became an
Equestria travel destination,

04:05.297 --> 04:06.238
he wrote about it.

04:06.403 --> 04:08.450
Before the culinary
revolution in Trottingham,

04:08.811 --> 04:09.986
he discovered it.

04:10.456 --> 04:13.075
He knows what's going to be hot
even before it's tepid.

04:15.758 --> 04:18.671
Sounds like somepony has
a little bit of a crush.

04:19.008 --> 04:20.419
Oh, Twilight.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.778
"Crush" doesn't even
begin to describe it!

04:23.094 --> 04:24.610
He's practically divine.

04:24.803 --> 04:26.087
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S COMING!

04:40.778 --> 04:42.602
Thank you ever so much
for joining me, Twilight.

04:43.034 --> 04:45.447
I don't think I could have
met Trenderhoof on my own.

04:45.933 --> 04:48.200
It's no problem, but you
shouldn't be nervous

04:48.218 --> 04:49.104
about meeting him.

04:52.089 --> 04:53.740
Is that him? Do you see him?
Twilight, is he there?

04:54.440 --> 04:56.269
Uh...I'm not sure.

04:56.741 --> 04:58.310
You don't suppose he
decided not to come?

04:58.534 --> 04:59.656
Twilight, I don't see him!

04:59.937 --> 05:01.129
What if he doesn't arrive?

05:01.344 --> 05:03.131
The whole festival
will be a disaster!

05:03.377 --> 05:04.714
TWILIGHT, WHERE IS HE?

05:06.801 --> 05:08.099
Ahem. Sorry.

05:08.626 --> 05:10.554
Rarity, you have to
get a hold of yourself.

05:10.825 --> 05:12.407
I mean, you haven't
even met him yet...

05:31.500 --> 05:32.439
What's wrong?

05:32.632 --> 05:33.077
Shhhhhhh.

05:33.412 --> 05:36.928
It's him, it's him, it's
him, he's here, it's him.

05:37.443 --> 05:39.145
Well, go up and talk to him.

05:42.076 --> 05:42.899
I can't.

05:47.596 --> 05:49.137
Um... Hi. Ahem.

05:49.607 --> 05:50.807
Hello. Mr. Trenderhoof.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.766
I am Rarity and I have been
chosen as Pony of Ceremonies

05:54.885 --> 05:56.587
for the Ponyville Days Festival.

05:59.301 --> 06:00.191
Please.

06:00.337 --> 06:01.479
Call me Trend.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.499
And over here will be the
climax of the Festival,

06:10.801 --> 06:12.481
The Ponyville Days Gala.

06:12.944 --> 06:14.550
Music. Dancing.

06:15.088 --> 06:18.111
And of course a locally sourced
menu of delicious treats.

06:18.421 --> 06:21.112
Reminds me of the Spring Fling
meets Manehattan Wedding

06:21.120 --> 06:22.727
I wrote about in
Gallop & Prance.

06:23.069 --> 06:25.978
Exactly! I can't
even describe

06:26.056 --> 06:28.070
how much your work
has influenced me.

06:31.900 --> 06:34.930
And finally, Sweet Apple Acres.

06:35.180 --> 06:37.814
Ponyville's core, heh
heh, so to speak,

06:37.974 --> 06:40.115
<i>where our quaint</i>
<i>little hamlet began.</i>

06:40.585 --> 06:42.491
<i>Oh! Breathtaking!</i>

06:44.243 --> 06:47.465
I've heard about it, of course,
but to see it in verite,

06:47.800 --> 06:50.688
to stand on the soil
of a working farm.

06:51.264 --> 06:52.817
You can really feel
the authenticity.

06:53.465 --> 06:56.794
Oh yes! Uh, they really
do grow apples here.

06:57.301 --> 06:58.409
Thank you, Rarity.

06:58.913 --> 07:00.468
Thank you for
bringing me here.

07:00.780 --> 07:03.375
This farm is truly
something special.

07:04.610 --> 07:07.666
I had planned to transform it
into an elegant country inn

07:07.740 --> 07:08.415
for the Festival,

07:09.002 --> 07:12.692
but now I see just how
special it is au natural.

07:13.428 --> 07:15.168
Au natural, indeed.

07:21.373 --> 07:21.888
Who.

07:22.478 --> 07:23.045
Is.

07:23.438 --> 07:24.132
That?

07:32.450 --> 07:33.947
Who? Applejack?

07:43.293 --> 07:43.902
Ahem.

07:44.462 --> 07:46.362
Why are you staring
at her like that?

07:46.878 --> 07:49.004
I've seen a lot in
my travels, but...

07:49.740 --> 07:52.161
I've never beheld such beauty.

07:53.129 --> 07:54.197
<i>Applejack.</i>

07:55.508 --> 07:57.445
The pony of my dreams.

08:03.280 --> 08:03.863
<i>Rarity?</i>

08:04.384 --> 08:05.168
Rarity?

08:05.777 --> 08:06.485
Hello?

08:12.965 --> 08:14.214
I brought my cider
tasting cup.

08:14.483 --> 08:15.959
Are you ready to
go try the samples?

08:16.805 --> 08:20.001
What's the point?

08:21.968 --> 08:23.061
Rarity, what's wrong?

08:25.075 --> 08:25.440
Nothing.

08:26.171 --> 08:27.445
Is it something I said?

08:28.593 --> 08:29.869
He doesn't like me.

08:30.300 --> 08:30.753
What?

08:31.560 --> 08:32.883
He doesn't like me.

08:33.159 --> 08:34.275
Rarity, I can't hear--

08:34.403 --> 08:38.122
HE DOESN'T LIKE ME BECAUSE
HE HAS A CRUSH ON APPLEJACK

08:38.136 --> 08:39.888
EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD
A CRUSH ON HIM EVER SINCE

08:39.892 --> 08:43.654
THE BEGINNING OF TIME
AND IT'S NOT FAIR!

08:43.787 --> 08:45.418
Trenderhoof doesn't like you?

08:45.880 --> 08:47.129
That's ridiculous.

08:48.858 --> 08:51.240
Oh, Spike, how could you
ever know what it's like

08:51.250 --> 08:53.131
to be totally
obsessed with a pony

08:53.143 --> 08:54.975
only to find out
they're obsessed

08:54.983 --> 08:56.956
with somepony else?

08:58.762 --> 09:02.963
I mean, what could Applejack
possibly have that I don't?

09:05.795 --> 09:07.012
Hmmm.

09:10.218 --> 09:12.936
You know, I have such
respect for the work ethic

09:12.946 --> 09:14.054
of Earth Ponies.

09:14.677 --> 09:16.591
Uh, gee, thanks.

09:17.084 --> 09:19.525
Granny Smith always said,
"Pick an apple a day

09:19.537 --> 09:20.661
and keep trouble away."

09:20.995 --> 09:23.539
How many varieties of
apples do you think there are?

09:24.060 --> 09:26.784
On the farm or in all
of Equestria because--

09:26.792 --> 09:28.811
I once had
an apple so rare,

09:28.922 --> 09:30.136
they thought it
was extinct.

09:30.245 --> 09:31.250
I ate four of them.

09:34.764 --> 09:36.119
Is that a fact?

09:36.489 --> 09:37.443
That's my thing.

09:37.732 --> 09:39.822
I take the mundane,
the simple, the...

09:40.265 --> 09:42.245
unappreciated, and
I make it relatable.

09:42.965 --> 09:44.901
Well, I hope you can
relate to Ponyville.

09:45.443 --> 09:46.120
Me too.

09:46.548 --> 09:47.447
But enough about me.

09:47.775 --> 09:48.979
I want to know about you.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.921
What do apples
mean to Applejack?

09:52.407 --> 09:55.529
Look, I'm glad you're
interested in Ponyville and all,

09:55.533 --> 09:57.715
but I'm kinda busy
with my chores

09:57.974 --> 09:59.178
and if I can't get 'em done,

09:59.484 --> 10:01.414
there won't be a
Ponyville Days Festival

10:01.428 --> 10:02.440
for you to write about.

10:02.649 --> 10:04.632
<i>Well, that</i>
<i>will never do!</i>

10:05.857 --> 10:08.647
Rarity, what are you wearing?

10:09.133 --> 10:10.920
What, this old thing?

10:11.482 --> 10:13.320
Aren't you too busy
planning the Festival

10:13.338 --> 10:14.950
to keep making new
outfits for it?

10:15.176 --> 10:18.720
I am, but the thought of
hauling apples inspired me

10:18.868 --> 10:20.452
and I just couldn't
stop myself.

10:21.557 --> 10:22.378
Really?

10:22.766 --> 10:26.425
If there's one thing I
love, it's hauling apples.

10:28.899 --> 10:31.416
I'm growing fond
of it, myself.

10:33.348 --> 10:35.582
Maybe you two should
try it sometime.

10:36.171 --> 10:38.120
I'm feeling a tad inspired.

10:39.266 --> 10:43.049
<i>♪ Without farm life there'd</i>
<i>be such disparity. ♪</i>

10:43.377 --> 10:47.010
<i>♪ These thoughts I think</i>
<i>with great clarity. ♪</i>

10:47.420 --> 10:52.156
<i>♪ Apples high to the sky,</i>
<i>She's the one of my eye. ♪</i>

10:52.677 --> 10:55.225
<i>That fruit hauling</i>
<i>pony named..♪.</i>

10:56.450 --> 10:57.523
<i>♪ ...Applejack. </i>

11:04.195 --> 11:06.928
Rarity, why do you
want to plow a field?

11:07.281 --> 11:09.280
Is it me or could this
use a splash of color,

11:09.773 --> 11:11.014
and maybe a wash?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.272
Don't we need to check
on the gala decorations?

11:13.523 --> 11:14.495
Yes, yes. Of course.

11:14.868 --> 11:16.942
But Trend obviously has
a thing for farm life.

11:17.367 --> 11:20.103
If I can't convince him that
I'm just as much of a farm hoof

11:20.117 --> 11:22.985
as Applejack, I'll never get him
interested in the Festival.

11:23.358 --> 11:24.355
The Festival.

11:24.801 --> 11:25.432
Right.

11:25.923 --> 11:28.720
And I do appreciate
your help ever so much.

11:29.344 --> 11:32.060
I couldn't do a thing
without you Spikey pooo.

11:32.811 --> 11:35.129
Well... that's what
friends are for.

11:35.533 --> 11:36.487
Right! So!

11:38.411 --> 11:41.551
Come... On... farm thing!

11:44.895 --> 11:46.772
How does Applejack do it?

11:47.299 --> 11:49.432
<i>Well, it would help</i>
<i>if the harness was on right.</i>

11:50.345 --> 11:51.705
What are you doing?

11:52.199 --> 11:54.243
I'm simply lending a
hoof with the chores...

11:54.782 --> 11:57.024
...which I love
doing ever so much.

11:58.815 --> 12:01.605
Well, if you're still
interested after the Festival,

12:01.613 --> 12:02.926
I can teach you all about it.

12:03.670 --> 12:06.655
But right now, I need to get the
plowing done if you don't mind.

12:08.930 --> 12:09.611
Not at all.

12:12.850 --> 12:14.238
She makes it look so easy.

12:14.641 --> 12:15.740
I know.

12:16.308 --> 12:18.097
Isn't she fantastic?

12:27.605 --> 12:29.921
I really don't see what
the fuss is all about.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.909
Now, Rarity, you be careful.

12:35.235 --> 12:37.319
If you don't get the
bucking just right,

12:37.560 --> 12:38.794
<i>you could sprain a hoof.</i>

12:39.354 --> 12:41.927
I am perfectly familiar with
the applebucking process,

12:42.058 --> 12:45.968
thank you very much, but while
you seem to rely on raw power,

12:46.329 --> 12:48.840
I believe a certain amount
of style is required.

12:49.455 --> 12:51.761
It's really more of a
dance, if you ask me.

13:00.271 --> 13:01.336
Et voilà.

13:02.277 --> 13:05.242
Well, your way is
definitely long on style.

13:05.562 --> 13:06.442
Thank you.

13:06.813 --> 13:09.574
Now if you'll all excuse me,
I have some more chores to do.

13:11.073 --> 13:12.070
Inside!

13:17.744 --> 13:19.921
Rarity, can I ask
you something?

13:20.634 --> 13:23.399
Why, Trend, you can
ask me anything.

13:23.986 --> 13:27.869
I've been meaning to ask
for a while and, frankly,

13:27.875 --> 13:29.549
I'm sort of embarrassed.

13:30.860 --> 13:31.880
Rarity...

13:32.778 --> 13:37.036
Do you think Applejack would
be my date for the Festival?

13:38.058 --> 13:40.140
Why don't you go ask
her yourself?

13:56.054 --> 13:56.460
Phew!

13:56.663 --> 13:58.066
That was close.

13:58.526 --> 14:01.389
If you've come to apologize,
there's really no need.

14:01.787 --> 14:03.196
What are you talking about?

14:03.424 --> 14:05.802
Let's dispense with
the charade, shall we?

14:06.300 --> 14:08.796
Listen, I know you really
want Trend to like you.

14:09.201 --> 14:09.966
And he does.

14:10.359 --> 14:12.690
Despite somepony's
best efforts.

14:13.379 --> 14:16.452
I swear, I don't know why he's
paying so much attention to me.

14:16.893 --> 14:19.697
And I don't know anypony who's
that interested in farming.

14:20.064 --> 14:20.905
Not even me.

14:21.424 --> 14:24.423
Well, maybe it's time Trend
met a real country pony.

14:25.061 --> 14:26.440
Shouldn't you be
working on the Festival

14:26.452 --> 14:28.967
<i>instead of coming up with</i>
<i>new ways to impress Trend?</i>

14:29.371 --> 14:31.040
Oh, I'm sure you'd love that.

14:31.391 --> 14:33.625
Well, I have a new
vision for the Festival.

14:34.021 --> 14:36.692
And it's gonna be more country

14:36.885 --> 14:40.152
than the whole Apple
Family put together!

14:43.914 --> 14:47.182
Um, Isn't it a little late
to be changing the theme?

14:48.542 --> 14:50.304
Applejack, what's going on?

14:50.862 --> 14:52.474
I'm too scared to guess.

14:54.136 --> 14:57.666
<i> Firstly, I just wanna</i>
<i>thank you'all for comin'</i>

14:58.037 --> 15:00.314
<i>and second I know</i>
<i>y'all will all adore</i>

15:00.320 --> 15:02.364
<i>my new Festival theme...</i>

15:08.099 --> 15:10.840
Simple Ways!

15:21.877 --> 15:24.437
Well, what's so funny?

15:24.786 --> 15:28.355
Rarity, that is the silliest
getup I have ever seen.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.466
It is a little funny.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.539
Funny?

15:33.145 --> 15:35.666
Rarity, you aren't
serious, are you?

15:35.929 --> 15:37.260
Well, of course I'm serious!

15:37.551 --> 15:38.460
Ahem...

15:38.790 --> 15:40.394
Why wouldn't I be?

15:40.846 --> 15:43.047
Because you would
never dress like that.

15:43.441 --> 15:46.610
You like fashion and high
society and fancy things.

15:46.868 --> 15:51.313
And I can like plowing fields
and hauling apples just as much.

15:51.434 --> 15:52.353
But you don't!

15:52.569 --> 15:54.333
How do you know
what I like?

15:54.544 --> 15:56.060
Because I know you.

15:56.390 --> 16:00.097
Well, maybe you don't know
me as well as you think.

16:00.403 --> 16:03.648
And I suppose it's just a
coincidence that Trenderhoof

16:03.654 --> 16:05.841
seems so interested
in country life too?

16:06.160 --> 16:08.384
I don't know what
you're gettin' at.

16:08.638 --> 16:10.770
Well, then I guess I'll
just have to show you.

16:11.088 --> 16:12.183
Be my guest.

16:12.325 --> 16:15.920
Now, if y'all will excuse
me, I have a hootenanny

16:15.937 --> 16:18.011
of a Festival to put on.

16:24.913 --> 16:28.519
Now, to be a model in the
Simple Ways fashion show,

16:29.145 --> 16:32.269
you might think simple
means less is more.

16:32.632 --> 16:34.870
Well, that just ain't so.

16:35.258 --> 16:38.960
If you want to be real
simple, more is more.

16:45.939 --> 16:49.783
Now y'all go off and make
yourselves look just like that.

16:54.357 --> 16:59.160
Who's our next model
for the fashion show?

16:59.625 --> 17:00.267
Um...

17:00.727 --> 17:02.540
Apple Jewel?

17:03.120 --> 17:04.770
Who the hay is that?

17:24.784 --> 17:26.456
Is this some kinda joke?

17:26.987 --> 17:31.978
Why, Rarity, what ever would
make you think I was joking?

17:32.380 --> 17:34.950
Because you would never
wear an ensemble like that!

17:35.186 --> 17:37.434
You like plowing fields
and hauling apples...

17:37.898 --> 17:41.211
And I can like
fashion just as much.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.575
But you don't!

17:43.061 --> 17:46.534
Well, maybe you do not know
me as well as you think.

17:46.860 --> 17:47.635
Fine.

17:47.882 --> 17:50.335
But I got a whole
Festival to plan,

17:50.663 --> 17:53.892
so if you're gonna start
modelin', just get on with it.

17:56.864 --> 17:59.781
Life is a festival, and you
should celebrate it

17:59.797 --> 18:04.624
by looking just like me, because
I'm a trend-setting Fashionista!

18:07.777 --> 18:10.587
You're a trend-setting
Fashionista?

18:10.999 --> 18:12.798
Why that's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever--

18:13.547 --> 18:16.099
I mean, good for you.

18:16.501 --> 18:20.029
I, on the other hoof, couldn't
care less how I look

18:20.308 --> 18:22.727
long as I get the chores done.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.502
Oh? Is that so?

18:28.080 --> 18:29.728
Yes indeedy doodle.

18:30.690 --> 18:31.656
Not me.

18:32.199 --> 18:35.793
My mane needs to be perfectly
coiffed at all times.

18:36.148 --> 18:41.102
Well, my mane is full
of dust and split ends.

18:41.340 --> 18:44.948
My hooves are so polished you
can see your reflection in them.

18:45.603 --> 18:49.830
My hooves are cracked and dry
from working in the fields!

18:50.093 --> 18:52.263
I'm so fashion forward.

18:52.651 --> 18:54.733
I wear droopy drawers.

18:54.950 --> 18:57.084
I smell like rosebuds.

18:57.430 --> 19:00.078
I LOVE BEING COVERED IN MUD!

19:09.363 --> 19:11.239
Goodness! Your couture!

19:12.078 --> 19:13.256
Oh, it's bad.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.698
Will somepony
bring me a towel

19:16.702 --> 19:19.034
to wipe this repulsive
filth from my hooves!

19:19.578 --> 19:21.203
There's the Rarity I know!

19:21.777 --> 19:25.426
Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry
I said all those things.

19:25.670 --> 19:27.744
You're a true friend who
probably knows me better

19:27.756 --> 19:28.708
than I know myself.

19:29.305 --> 19:32.770
I don't know what I was thinking
wearing this ridiculous outfit.

19:33.014 --> 19:34.431
I kinda know how you feel.

19:34.967 --> 19:37.744
But you were just trying to help
me see how silly I was being.

19:38.306 --> 19:39.717
And you were right.

19:40.891 --> 19:43.170
Besides, that gown
looks just gorgeous on you.

19:43.592 --> 19:45.557
I wish I hadn't ruined it.

19:45.826 --> 19:47.480
Thanks. It's
nice ain't it?

19:47.779 --> 19:49.057
It's magnificent!

19:49.328 --> 19:50.544
Wherever did
you get it?

19:51.293 --> 19:53.598
Oh. It's uh... one of yours.

19:56.616 --> 19:59.077
I'll need 3 gallons of boiling
water and one ounce of detergent

19:59.149 --> 19:59.742
START!

20:02.831 --> 20:04.958
I'm moving to Ponyville!

20:06.372 --> 20:09.633
Being the most interesting Pony
in Equestria is exhausting.

20:10.023 --> 20:12.593
I want to leave my exotic,
exciting life behind

20:12.600 --> 20:14.846
and live on a farm.

20:15.051 --> 20:15.923
What?

20:16.011 --> 20:19.711
Well, that's real nice, but I
sure hope you weren't thinking

20:19.728 --> 20:20.866
of Sweet Apple Acres.

20:21.537 --> 20:22.415
Oh.

20:23.791 --> 20:28.240
Look, you're a fine
pony, but uh, well, I'm...

20:28.253 --> 20:30.729
I think what Applejack
is trying to say,

20:30.739 --> 20:33.211
is that there's something
unappealing about a pony

20:33.227 --> 20:36.259
who'd change themselves so much
just to impress somepony else.

20:36.868 --> 20:40.915
If somepony doesn't like you for
who you are, it's their loss.

20:42.427 --> 20:44.191
Well, this is awkward.

20:44.548 --> 20:45.360
Not at all.

20:45.724 --> 20:46.409
In fact...

20:46.755 --> 20:48.805
I think I know
just how you feel.

20:49.516 --> 20:50.544
What do you think, Rarity?

20:50.965 --> 20:53.525
Is it too late to go
back to Small Town Chic?

20:53.849 --> 20:55.227
Not if I can help it!

20:58.721 --> 21:01.012
<i>Organizing the</i>
<i>Ponyville Days Celebration</i>

21:01.022 --> 21:03.338
<i>was one of the hardest</i>
<i>things I've ever done...</i>

21:06.595 --> 21:08.263
<i>But I learned an</i>
<i>important lesson.</i>

21:09.925 --> 21:12.401
<i>Real friends will like</i>
<i>you for who you are</i>

21:13.596 --> 21:17.118
and changing yourself to impress
them is no way to make new ones.

21:20.753 --> 21:23.178
<i>And when you're as</i>
<i>fabulous as I am...</i>

21:27.980 --> 21:29.560
<i>it's practically a crime.</i>
