Happy! Sad.
Happy! Sad.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.913
Open, shut.

01:56.385 --> 01:57.677
Morning, Daisy Jo!

01:57.678 --> 01:59.668
You here to pick up some cookies
to go with your milk?

01:59.669 --> 02:01.753
Oh ya, Pinkie, don'tcha know?

02:01.754 --> 02:05.111
Well, Mrs. Cake just baked a fresh batch
of your favorite oatmeal.

02:06.138 --> 02:08.007
Sounds delightful!

02:10.009 --> 02:12.807
Rose, your calla lilies look even better
than last year!

02:12.808 --> 02:15.318
I bet you'll take first prize
at the flower show again.

02:15.319 --> 02:17.387
Thanks, Pinkie.
Would you like one?

02:17.388 --> 02:18.806
Absolutely!

02:25.061 --> 02:27.035
Looking fit as a fiddle, Mr. Waddle.

02:27.036 --> 02:29.207
And you're wearing my favorite tie!

02:29.208 --> 02:32.819
Aw shucks Miss Pinkie,
you flatterer you.

02:34.162 --> 02:36.435
Well, happy birthday, Cheerilee.

02:36.436 --> 02:38.248
Thank you, Pinkie.

02:38.249 --> 02:40.786
Happy day-after-your-birthday, Zecora!

02:40.787 --> 02:43.396
What a lovely hi, Miss Pinkie Pie!

02:43.397 --> 02:46.108
And Miss Matilda, happy birthday to you...

02:47.388 --> 02:49.508
...in one hundred and thirty two days!

02:49.788 --> 02:54.723
Pinkie Pie, how do you remember
everything about everypony?

02:54.888 --> 03:00.138
'Cause everypony's my friend
and I love to see my friends smile!

03:05.709 --> 03:08.866
<i>My name is Pinkie Pie
(Hello!)</i>

03:08.867 --> 03:12.097
<i>And I am here to say
(How ya doin?)</i>

03:12.098 --> 03:14.507
<i>I'm gonna make you smile</i>

03:14.508 --> 03:18.126
<i>And I will brighten up your day!</i>

03:18.127 --> 03:21.254
<i>It doesn't matter now
(What's up?)</i>

03:21.255 --> 03:24.220
<i>If you are sad or blue
(Howdy!)</i>

03:24.221 --> 03:26.756
<i>'Cuz cheering up my friends</i>

03:26.757 --> 03:30.463
<i>Is just what Pinkie's here to do!</i>

03:30.464 --> 03:36.434
<i>'Cuz I love to make you smile, smile, smile!
(Yes I do!)</i>

03:36.435 --> 03:42.846
<i>It fills my heart with sunshine all the while!
(Yes it does!)</i>

03:42.847 --> 03:47.398
<i>'Cuz all I really need's a
smile, smile, smile!</i>

03:47.399 --> 03:50.209
<i>From these happy friends of mine!</i>

03:52.084 --> 03:55.149
<i>I like to see you grin!
(Awesome!)</i>

03:55.150 --> 03:58.023
<i>I love to see you beam!
(Rock on!)</i>

03:58.024 --> 04:01.291
<i>The corners of your mouth turned up</i>

04:01.292 --> 04:04.364
<i>Is always Pinkie's dream!
(Hoof bump!)</i>

04:04.365 --> 04:07.093
<i>But if you're kind of worried</i>

04:07.094 --> 04:10.319
<i>And your face is made of frown</i>

04:10.320 --> 04:13.575
<i>I'll work your heart and do my best</i>

04:13.576 --> 04:17.934
<i>To turn that sad frown upside down!</i>

04:17.935 --> 04:23.946
<i>'Cuz I love to make you grin, grin, grin!
(Yes I do!)</i>

04:23.947 --> 04:29.414
<i>Busted out from ear to ear, let it begin!</i>

04:30.538 --> 04:35.150
<i>Just give me a joyful
grin, grin, grin!</i>

04:35.151 --> 04:37.403
<i>And you fill me with good cheer!</i>

04:37.404 --> 04:41.878
<i>It's true, some days are dark and lonely</i>

04:41.879 --> 04:44.380
<i>And maybe you feel sad</i>

04:44.381 --> 04:48.896
<i>But Pinkie will be there to show you
that it isn't that bad!</i>

04:48.897 --> 04:51.409
<i>There is one thing that makes me happy</i>

04:51.410 --> 04:55.058
<i>And makes my whole life worthwhile</i>

04:55.059 --> 05:00.926
<i>And that's when I talk to my friends
and get them to smile!</i>

05:01.227 --> 05:04.260
<i>I really am so happy!</i>

05:04.261 --> 05:06.994
<i>Your smile fills me with glee!</i>

05:06.995 --> 05:10.450
<i>I give a smile, I get a smile</i>

05:10.451 --> 05:12.991
<i>And that's so special to me!</i>

05:13.392 --> 05:19.239
<i>'Cuz I love to see you beam, beam, beam!
(Yes I do!)</i>

05:19.240 --> 05:25.664
<i>Tell me what more can I say to make you see
(That I do!)</i>

05:25.665 --> 05:30.478
<i>It makes me happy when you
beam, beam, beam!</i>

05:30.479 --> 05:33.794
<i>Yes, it always makes my day!</i>

05:33.795 --> 05:36.698
<i>Come on everypony, smile, smile smile!</i>

05:36.699 --> 05:40.000
<i>Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine!</i>

05:40.001 --> 05:42.905
<i>All I really need's a
smile, smile, smile!</i>

05:42.906 --> 05:46.002
<i>From these happy friends of mine!</i>

05:46.003 --> 05:48.962
<i>Come on everypony, smile, smile, smile!</i>

05:48.963 --> 05:52.088
<i>Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine!</i>

05:52.089 --> 05:54.963
<i>All I really need's a
smile, smile, smile!</i>

05:54.964 --> 05:58.040
<i>From these happy friends of mine!</i>

05:58.041 --> 06:01.116
<i>That's the perfect gift for me!
(Come on everypony, smile, smile, smile!)</i>

06:01.117 --> 06:04.279
<i>It's a smile as wide as a mile!
(Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine!)</i>

06:04.280 --> 06:07.058
<i>To make me happy as can be!
(All I really need's a smile, smile, smile!)</i>

06:07.059 --> 06:08.594
<i>To make me happy as can be!
(From these happy friends of...)</i>

06:08.595 --> 06:16.411
<i>Smile! Smile! Smile! Smile! Smiiiiiile!</i>

06:16.412 --> 06:19.400
<i>Come on and smile!
(Smile!)</i>

06:19.401 --> 06:21.450
<i>Come on and smile!</i>

06:24.590 --> 06:26.748
I've never seen you before.

06:26.749 --> 06:29.019
Kid, you're smarter than you look.

06:29.020 --> 06:31.768
Thanks! I'm Pinkie Pie.
What's your name?

06:36.398 --> 06:38.161
"Property of C.D.D."

06:38.162 --> 06:40.348
I'm guessing that last "D"
is for Donkey.

06:40.398 --> 06:41.858
Quick as a whip, kid.

06:41.888 --> 06:43.818
Now, how about that C...

06:45.036 --> 06:50.708
Calvin? Calhoun? Caleb? Carl? Carmine?
Carlo? Charlie? Chester? Chico?

06:50.709 --> 06:55.787
Claudio? Cleetus? Clifford? Coraline?
Cornelius? Cortez? Crank? Christopher?

06:55.788 --> 06:58.018
Cranky! It's Cranky, alright?!

06:58.496 --> 06:59.596
And your middle name?

07:00.595 --> 07:01.246
Doodle.

07:01.247 --> 07:02.847
- I'm sorry?
- Doodle.

07:02.848 --> 07:04.288
One more time!

07:06.404 --> 07:07.492
Doodle.

07:08.740 --> 07:11.866
So you're a Cranky Doodle Donkey?

07:12.067 --> 07:14.168
<i>You're a Cranky Doodle Donkey guy</i>

07:14.169 --> 07:16.103
<i>A Cranky Doodle Donkey</i>

07:16.104 --> 07:17.903
<i>I've never met you,
but you're my new friend</i>

07:17.904 --> 07:20.065
<i>And I'm your best friend Pinkie Pie!</i>

07:20.546 --> 07:23.836
C'mon now, Doodle. Give a smile!

07:25.880 --> 07:28.798
Nopony calls me Doodle!

07:33.810 --> 07:35.975
What just happened?

07:37.336 --> 07:39.280
<i>Meet somepony new, check.</i>

07:39.281 --> 07:40.975
<i>Introduce myself, check.</i>

07:40.976 --> 07:43.449
<i>Sing random song outta nowhere, check.</i>

07:43.450 --> 07:46.615
<i>Become instant best friends... uncheck.</i>

07:47.561 --> 07:51.288
I don't get it, how can somepony
not become instant best friends with me?

07:51.289 --> 07:55.144
Was it something I said?
Was it something I sang?

07:57.088 --> 07:59.292
This is no time for the blame game,
Pinkie!

07:59.293 --> 08:03.089
There's somepony new in town,
and you need to win him over!

08:03.190 --> 08:07.185
"Try everything you can to make
Cranky smile and be your friend".

08:08.088 --> 08:09.068
Check!

08:16.570 --> 08:17.614
Alright, Pinkie.

08:17.615 --> 08:21.102
If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship,
you're gonna have to bring your A game!

08:21.415 --> 08:22.935
Let's do this.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.460
Howdy doody, Cranky Doodle!

08:32.530 --> 08:36.574
So... are you moving to Ponyville,
Cranky?

08:36.575 --> 08:38.531
What gave you the hint there, kid?

08:38.532 --> 08:40.158
The cart full of stuff, maybe?

08:40.190 --> 08:41.929
Well, I'd be happy to show you around.

08:41.930 --> 08:44.120
It's the least a new friend can do.

08:45.300 --> 08:49.659
Listen, kid, I traveled around Equestria
my entire life.

08:49.660 --> 08:53.140
I've made many friends.
I don't need any more.

08:53.141 --> 08:56.256
Gosh! I could never have
too many friends!

08:56.257 --> 08:59.035
Well, why don't you go
and make some more?

08:59.236 --> 09:03.632
But I don't need to go,
when I can stay and make friends...

09:03.633 --> 09:04.933
...with you.

09:07.364 --> 09:08.510
Look, kid...

09:08.511 --> 09:13.530
Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie.
All of my friends do.

09:13.931 --> 09:15.992
Look, kid,

09:16.093 --> 09:20.255
I came to Ponyville for some peace
and quiet and privacy,

09:20.256 --> 09:22.169
to be alone with my memories.

09:22.170 --> 09:26.047
All I want is to get to my new home
and unpack my stuff.

09:26.870 --> 09:29.141
What does this bauble do?

09:29.839 --> 09:31.059
Don't touch that!

09:32.362 --> 09:33.338
What's this?

09:35.212 --> 09:36.755
Please, don't!

09:37.256 --> 09:38.298
Look at these!

09:42.145 --> 09:45.836
Pinkie! Keep your hooves off my wagon!

09:46.397 --> 09:47.966
Okay, Cranky.

09:54.408 --> 09:56.726
I promised not to touch your wagon
so I brought one of my own!

09:57.150 --> 09:59.117
I use it to welcome folks!

09:58.970 --> 10:00.418
Who'da guessed...

10:00.419 --> 10:03.017
Maybe we can be wagon buddies?

10:04.808 --> 10:07.611
Well, you've gotta at least let me
give you the special welcome

10:07.612 --> 10:09.250
that comes with it...

10:13.469 --> 10:15.992
Let's get this over with.

10:15.993 --> 10:17.393
That's the spirit!

10:22.742 --> 10:24.397
<i>Welcome welcome welcome</i>

10:24.398 --> 10:26.222
<i>A fine welcome to you</i>

10:26.223 --> 10:29.939
<i>Welcome welcome welcome
I say how do you do?</i>

10:29.940 --> 10:33.443
<i>Welcome welcome welcome
I say hip hip hurray</i>

10:33.444 --> 10:39.238
<i>Welcome welcome welcome
to Ponyville today!</i>

10:40.400 --> 10:41.830
Wait for it!

10:49.312 --> 10:50.733
Oh, silly me!

10:50.734 --> 10:54.294
I must've put the confetti in the oven
and the cake in the confetti cannons!

10:54.295 --> 10:55.395
Again!

10:59.217 --> 11:01.428
Still delicious!
Try some, Cranky.

11:01.429 --> 11:03.211
It's sure to make you smile.

11:04.434 --> 11:06.246
Where is it, where is it?

11:06.247 --> 11:07.334
Where is what?

11:09.327 --> 11:10.870
Spider! Big hairy spider!

11:15.477 --> 11:16.943
Stop, stop, stop!

11:20.018 --> 11:21.371
Was that your wig?

11:21.934 --> 11:23.556
I can fix this, I can fix this!

11:24.553 --> 11:28.051
Hey, everypony!
Does anypony have a toupee?

11:31.470 --> 11:35.570
This donkey is really, really, bald!

11:39.793 --> 11:43.250
What's so funny?
This is serious business, everypony!

11:43.251 --> 11:46.857
Cranky needs a new wig
to cover his hairless head!

11:46.858 --> 11:48.900
I have had enough!

11:53.458 --> 11:54.663
You're losing him, Pinkie.

11:55.124 --> 11:59.195
Wait, Cranky, please!
Let me make it up to you...

11:59.196 --> 11:59.996
No!

11:59.997 --> 12:02.776
Please! Please please please...

12:03.273 --> 12:05.485
Ladies, this is a spa emergency.

12:05.486 --> 12:06.952
Cranky needs help, STAT.

12:21.353 --> 12:23.522
Hi, Cranky, I have a gift for you!

12:23.523 --> 12:25.606
The spa treatment was gift enough.

12:25.607 --> 12:27.891
It's not going to
explode or anything, promise.

12:27.892 --> 12:28.892
Just open it!

12:31.736 --> 12:33.176
It's a new toupee!

12:33.177 --> 12:34.838
I had my friend Rarity make it.

12:34.839 --> 12:37.379
She calls it the "dreamboat special".

12:41.624 --> 12:44.800
This is wonderful.
Thanks, kid.

12:49.071 --> 12:52.447
He's starting to warm up,
but still no smile.

12:56.386 --> 12:59.139
Hey! Whatcha doing there,
ol' buddy ol' pal?

12:59.140 --> 13:00.340
What's it look like?

13:00.341 --> 13:02.118
Looks like a yard sale.

13:02.519 --> 13:04.389
I'll give you two bits for this!

13:06.700 --> 13:09.378
I'm not selling, kid.
I'm unpacking.

13:10.179 --> 13:11.874
Why didn't you say so?

13:11.875 --> 13:13.862
I thought I had.

13:15.147 --> 13:18.017
This is so pretty!
Where'd you get it?

13:18.018 --> 13:21.020
Manehattan, now put it down, gently.

13:21.021 --> 13:23.278
Really? What were you doin' there?

13:23.279 --> 13:25.230
Trying to find a friend...

13:26.221 --> 13:28.754
I'm always trying to find friends,
and today I found you.

13:28.755 --> 13:30.055
See how good I am at it?

13:30.156 --> 13:32.187
This was a special friend.

13:32.188 --> 13:36.077
- Like me?
- No, you're extra special, kid.

13:37.287 --> 13:38.834
Yes, I'm in!

13:41.328 --> 13:44.059
Where in Equestria did you get this,
Cranky?

13:44.060 --> 13:45.160
Fillydelphia.

13:45.304 --> 13:47.253
It's awfully pretty.

13:48.022 --> 13:49.734
Yes, she was.

13:50.769 --> 13:52.620
I mean, it was. I mean, it is.

13:52.621 --> 13:54.732
Yes, it's pretty, now put it down!

13:58.790 --> 14:01.106
I wonder where Cranky got this.

14:02.891 --> 14:04.601
Will you look at that?

14:05.102 --> 14:07.434
Hey, Cranky!
Can I ask you about...

14:10.057 --> 14:10.889
Oh no!

14:10.890 --> 14:13.230
What did you sa-yayayayay!

14:13.231 --> 14:14.976
What have you done?!

14:20.012 --> 14:22.485
There!
All better?

14:22.486 --> 14:26.938
No, not all better, all soggy!

14:26.939 --> 14:28.424
I'm sorry, Cranky!

14:28.425 --> 14:32.495
Oh, you're sorry, well, then,
everything is fine!

14:33.937 --> 14:36.659
- It is?
- No! It isn't!

14:36.660 --> 14:39.987
Listen to me, kid,
I will never be your friend!

14:40.399 --> 14:42.616
Never, or never-ever?

14:42.617 --> 14:45.276
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever!

14:48.173 --> 14:53.970
That's four "ever"s.
That's like... forever!

14:56.020 --> 14:57.789
I just can't believe it.

14:57.790 --> 15:01.792
Cranky said he would never forever
be my friend.

15:02.670 --> 15:04.263
It was horrible.

15:04.264 --> 15:08.469
I know this is hard for you, Pinkie.
Seeing that you're friends with everypony.

15:08.470 --> 15:11.815
But you just have to accept that Cranky
is gonna be an exception.

15:12.116 --> 15:14.226
He just... doesn't want to be bothered.

15:14.427 --> 15:18.251
Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered
by your over-the-top super-hyper antics.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.252
Rainbow!

15:19.253 --> 15:23.270
No, no, it's okay, Twilight.
I get what you're saying.

15:23.271 --> 15:24.927
What you're both saying.

15:24.928 --> 15:28.232
And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone.

15:28.233 --> 15:31.715
Right after he accepts my apology!

15:39.985 --> 15:41.122
Cranky!

15:41.123 --> 15:44.522
No! No!
Leave me alone!

15:45.387 --> 15:46.195
Wait!

15:46.696 --> 15:48.982
I understand that you don't want me
as a friend!

15:48.983 --> 15:50.593
No, I don't!

15:50.594 --> 15:53.011
So I just wanted to say "I'm sorry"!

15:53.012 --> 15:54.665
Fine! You said it!

15:54.666 --> 15:56.284
But do you accept my apology?

15:56.285 --> 15:57.085
No!

15:57.724 --> 16:01.066
Oh Cranky! Please accept my apology!
Please!

16:01.067 --> 16:01.867
No!

16:01.868 --> 16:04.304
But I'm really, really, really...

16:05.205 --> 16:07.089
Really, really...

16:11.751 --> 16:13.912
Really, really, really...

16:16.666 --> 16:18.651
Really, really, really...

16:19.874 --> 16:21.637
Really, really, really...

16:24.246 --> 16:26.448
Really, really, really,really...

16:26.449 --> 16:31.636
Really. Really. Really. Really.
Really. Really. Really. Really...

16:31.637 --> 16:33.184
Sorry!

16:44.403 --> 16:48.454
Cranky, please, please accept my apology!

16:49.901 --> 16:52.820
I'd do anything to make it up to you!

16:52.821 --> 16:54.734
But there's nothing you can do!

16:54.735 --> 16:56.153
You ruined my book!

16:56.154 --> 16:59.306
You destroyed all I have
to remember her by!

16:59.307 --> 17:01.424
Her?
Her who?

17:01.425 --> 17:03.170
The special friend?

17:03.171 --> 17:04.968
Go away, Pinkie!

17:15.226 --> 17:17.366
Cranky? It's me again.

17:17.367 --> 17:21.206
I understand that you don't wanna
be my friend or accept my apology...

17:21.207 --> 17:23.298
Before I leave you alone forever,

17:23.299 --> 17:27.126
I have something to at least try
to make up for ruining your book.

17:27.127 --> 17:29.377
No, I don't want it, kid!

17:29.378 --> 17:33.210
Anything you would give me is sure
to lead to some sort of disaster!

17:33.211 --> 17:36.759
Goodness, you really are cranky.

17:46.218 --> 17:50.522
It can't be... is it really you?

17:50.523 --> 17:53.278
It can, and it is.

17:53.279 --> 17:56.318
Matilda! But how?

17:56.857 --> 17:58.003
Pinkie.

17:58.717 --> 18:01.498
But... I never told you about her!

18:01.499 --> 18:02.759
You didn't have to.

18:02.760 --> 18:06.831
I put two and two and two together
and it added up to Matilda.

18:06.832 --> 18:07.632
What?

18:07.633 --> 18:09.816
Well when you were talking about
your souvenirs,

18:09.817 --> 18:12.175
you said something about trying to find
a special friend!

18:13.396 --> 18:16.036
And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday.

18:16.037 --> 18:18.951
My birthday isn't for
another seventy five days!

18:20.075 --> 18:23.939
And then, in your scrapbook,
there was a flower, an old ticket,

18:23.940 --> 18:26.099
and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala!

18:26.100 --> 18:28.736
And I knew I recognized all these things.

18:28.737 --> 18:31.382
But how could you have
ever seen them before?

18:31.383 --> 18:34.977
Because I also have them in my scrapbook.

18:34.978 --> 18:38.148
And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!

18:40.920 --> 18:42.685
Oh, Matilda.

18:42.686 --> 18:46.506
The night we met at the gala
was the most magical night of my life.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.703
<i>I couldn't wait to see you again.</i>

18:58.204 --> 19:02.000
<i>But when I came to your room
the next day, you were gone.</i>

19:02.001 --> 19:03.590
<i>Didn't you get my note?</i>

19:03.591 --> 19:06.085
<i>No, I never got it.</i>

19:07.808 --> 19:10.779
<i>Ever since that day,
I've gone from town...</i>

19:10.780 --> 19:13.894
<i>to town... to town...</i>

19:13.895 --> 19:16.475
<i>Searching all over Equestria for you.</i>

19:16.476 --> 19:18.920
Until finally I gave up.

19:18.921 --> 19:22.154
I came to Ponyville
to retire from my search.

19:22.155 --> 19:25.517
I was living in Ponyville
the whole time.

19:25.518 --> 19:29.854
I always hoped that some day
you would come and find me.

19:29.855 --> 19:30.855
Doodle.

19:32.249 --> 19:34.870
Matilda?
Nopony calls him Doodle...

19:34.871 --> 19:37.859
Nopony... but Matilda.

19:43.876 --> 19:47.385
Doodle, I'm so happy to see you.

20:01.979 --> 20:04.241
So does this mean
that you accept my apology?

20:04.242 --> 20:07.132
Yes, Pinkie, I accept your apology.

20:07.133 --> 20:10.719
And, I am honored to call you my friend.

20:18.745 --> 20:21.071
This is just fantastic!

20:21.702 --> 20:24.842
Now we can hang out together,
and chat, and sing songs, and...

20:24.843 --> 20:25.843
party!

20:25.844 --> 20:27.951
I can throw you guys a big party!

20:27.952 --> 20:30.676
It'll be called "Welcome to Ponyville,
I found my lost love...

20:30.677 --> 20:32.841
I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie" Party!

20:35.003 --> 20:38.101
Or maybe something less over-the-top
and not so super-hyper.

20:38.102 --> 20:41.694
Pinkie, we're eternally
grateful to you, but...

20:41.695 --> 20:46.496
Matilda and I just want to spend some
time together in peace and quiet.

20:47.706 --> 20:48.934
But we're still friends?

20:48.935 --> 20:53.266
Pinkie, you went way, way, way
out of your way to make me happy.

20:53.267 --> 20:55.229
Of course we're friends.

20:56.348 --> 20:57.187
Great!

20:59.339 --> 21:00.933
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

21:00.934 --> 21:02.633
<i>there are many different kinds of friends,</i>

21:02.634 --> 21:04.858
<i>and many ways to express friendship.</i>

21:04.859 --> 21:07.904
Some friends like to run and laugh
and play together.

21:07.905 --> 21:11.423
<i>But others just like to be left alone,
and that's fine too.</i>

21:11.424 --> 21:16.256
<i>But the best thing about friendship
is being able to make your friends smile.</i>

21:16.457 --> 21:20.321
<i>He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheart</i>

21:20.322 --> 21:23.476
<i>She's his Cranky Doodle joy</i>

21:23.477 --> 21:26.442
<i>I helped a Cranky Doodle boy, yeah</i>

21:26.443 --> 21:28.913
<i>I helped a Cranky Doodle boy</i>

21:28.914 --> 21:30.114
Pinkie!

21:30.215 --> 21:32.323
Oops, privacy, sorry.
