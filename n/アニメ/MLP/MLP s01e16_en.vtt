WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:07.169
Now, what have we learned?

00:07.170 --> 00:08.444
Lots of control...

00:08.445 --> 00:09.018
Good.

00:09.019 --> 00:10.747
Screaming and hollering...

00:10.748 --> 00:12.836
Yes. And most importantly...

00:12.936 --> 00:13.770
Passion!

00:13.771 --> 00:14.639
Right!

00:14.812 --> 00:18.711
So now that you know the elements
of a good cheer, let's hear one!

00:19.813 --> 00:20.774
Yay.

00:21.993 --> 00:24.021
You're gonna cheer for me like that?

00:24.440 --> 00:25.917
-Louder.
-Yay.

00:25.918 --> 00:27.353
-Louder!
-Yay.

00:27.393 --> 00:29.063
LOUDER!!!

00:31.309 --> 00:32.651
Yaaay.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.231
Too loud?

01:15.615 --> 01:16.412
Yay.

01:23.055 --> 01:25.812
And now, phase one of my routine...

01:29.074 --> 01:30.395
Woo...

01:31.901 --> 01:33.099
Phase two...

01:46.748 --> 01:48.337
Way to go.

01:48.546 --> 01:50.753
Here we go. Phase three...

01:50.822 --> 01:52.822
The sonic rainboom!

02:00.409 --> 02:01.877
Come on!

02:08.621 --> 02:09.443
Uh-oh.

02:13.736 --> 02:14.765
Last one.

02:15.168 --> 02:18.169
Thank you so much for helping me
clean up all these books, guys.

02:18.170 --> 02:21.079
It was a crazy weekend of studying.

02:28.055 --> 02:29.913
Rainbow Dash, you rock.

02:29.914 --> 02:31.067
Woohoo.

02:31.504 --> 02:33.406
Did my cheering do that?

02:35.305 --> 02:37.005
Sorry about that, ladies.

02:37.327 --> 02:39.867
That was a truly feeble performance.

02:39.868 --> 02:44.602
Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly
liked it when you made the clouds spin.

02:45.257 --> 02:48.950
I'm not talking about my performance.
I'm talking about yours.

02:49.189 --> 02:50.725
That feeble cheering.

02:50.726 --> 02:52.245
What are you two arguing about?

02:52.246 --> 02:54.768
Were we arguing? I'm sorry.

02:55.522 --> 03:00.081
I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see
me competing in the Best Young Flyer Competition.

03:00.082 --> 03:01.164
What's that?

03:01.472 --> 03:03.417
It's where all the greatest
pegasus flyers get together...

03:03.418 --> 03:05.457
...and show off their different flying styles!

03:05.458 --> 03:06.610
Some are fast!

03:09.831 --> 03:11.781
And some are graceful.

03:15.871 --> 03:19.558
Golly! I'd love to see you strut
your stuff in that competition.

03:19.559 --> 03:21.809
Yeah. I wish you guys could be there.

03:22.095 --> 03:26.014
Fluttershy is a great support,
but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.

03:26.243 --> 03:28.875
Ooh! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom!

03:28.876 --> 03:30.705
It's, like, the most coolest thing ever!

03:30.706 --> 03:34.593
Even though I've never actually seen it,
but, I mean, come on, it's a sonic rainboom!

03:34.594 --> 03:37.016
How not cool could it possibly not be?

03:37.017 --> 03:39.083
What's a "sonic rainboom"?

03:39.341 --> 03:41.017
You really need to get out more.

03:41.383 --> 03:43.597
The sonic rainboom is legendary!

03:43.598 --> 03:46.563
When a pegasus like Rainbow Dash
gets going so fast...

03:46.658 --> 03:47.595
Boom!

03:47.672 --> 03:50.687
...a sonic boom and a rainbow
can happen all at once!

03:50.846 --> 03:54.293
And Rainbow Dash here's
the only pony to ever pull it off.

03:54.294 --> 03:57.543
It was a long time ago. I was just a filly.

03:57.544 --> 03:59.854
Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?

04:01.182 --> 04:02.882
A-are you kidding?

04:02.883 --> 04:05.981
I'm the greatest flyer
to ever come out of Cloudsdale.

04:06.232 --> 04:08.926
I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.

04:09.042 --> 04:12.838
Wow. If you pull that off,
you'll win the crown for sure.

04:12.839 --> 04:16.160
The grand prize is an entire
day with the Wonderbolts.

04:16.161 --> 04:19.551
A whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes.

04:19.552 --> 04:21.667
It'll be a dream come true!

04:21.668 --> 04:22.896
Yay.

04:23.873 --> 04:25.633
I'm gonna go rest up.

04:25.634 --> 04:27.851
Don't wanna overprepare myself, you know.

04:28.687 --> 04:32.335
You, on the other hand, better keep practicing.

04:32.336 --> 04:36.421
I need a cheering section to match
my spectacular performance.

04:38.616 --> 04:42.650
She's practiced that move a hundred times
and she's never even come close to doing it.

04:42.651 --> 04:45.551
I don't know if I can
cheer loud enough to help her.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.507
Well, guess we better get this cleaned up.

04:50.759 --> 04:51.718
Again.

04:52.566 --> 04:54.034
Go on, go on.

04:54.035 --> 04:55.066
Go on what?

04:55.067 --> 04:58.711
Find a spell that will get us
wingless ponies into Cloudsdale.

04:58.712 --> 05:00.982
Didn't you see how nervous she was?

05:00.983 --> 05:03.275
Nervous?! Have you spit your bit or someth'n?

05:03.276 --> 05:06.618
She was tootin' her own horn louder
than the brass section of a marchin' band.

05:06.619 --> 05:08.081
Oh, please.

05:08.082 --> 05:12.301
I've put on enough fashion shows
to recognize stage fright when I see it.

05:12.302 --> 05:14.432
You've got to find a way to be there for her.

05:14.433 --> 05:15.868
Now go on!

05:17.650 --> 05:20.606
How am I supposed to find
a flight spell in this mess?

05:20.607 --> 05:22.346
A flight spell? One sec.

05:23.709 --> 05:25.163
Page 27.

05:25.771 --> 05:26.706
How'd you do that?

05:26.707 --> 05:29.340
It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash
knocked me into the bookcase.

05:29.341 --> 05:30.399
Here it is!

05:30.400 --> 05:34.333
A spell that will allow earth ponies
to fly for three days.

05:34.827 --> 05:37.974
Ooh... It looks really difficult.

05:37.975 --> 05:39.741
I'm not sure I can do it.

05:39.742 --> 05:41.191
You've got to try.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.897
Okay. But who's gonna volunteer
to be the test subject?

05:47.841 --> 05:49.209
I will!

05:49.210 --> 05:51.728
For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.

05:51.911 --> 05:53.258
Here goes...

06:14.751 --> 06:16.284
I think it worked.

06:18.668 --> 06:21.373
You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy.

06:22.046 --> 06:23.635
Don't be afraid to speak up.

06:30.616 --> 06:33.463
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

06:33.464 --> 06:36.526
It's our old friend, Rainbow Crash!

06:36.626 --> 06:38.856
Get kicked out of any flight schools lately?

06:40.188 --> 06:41.920
I didn't get kicked out.

06:41.939 --> 06:48.385
Face it, Rainbow Crash. Flight school had
too many rules and not enough naptimes for you.

06:48.386 --> 06:51.810
Huh. Ask her about the sonic rainboom!

06:51.860 --> 06:54.235
That's nothing but an old mares' tale.

06:54.236 --> 06:57.138
You don't have the skills
to try something like that.

06:57.139 --> 06:58.984
Now wait just a minute!

06:59.847 --> 07:02.740
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive.

07:02.741 --> 07:05.930
Anyhow, she *is* going to do a sonic rainboom.

07:05.931 --> 07:08.632
No, she's not, cause there's no such thing.

07:08.633 --> 07:11.401
The show up at the Cloudiseum
and see for yourself.

07:11.862 --> 07:12.916
...if you're free.

07:13.827 --> 07:15.184
Yeah, I'll be free.

07:15.377 --> 07:17.436
Oh, don't worry. We'll be there.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.065
See you then, Rainbow Crash!

07:20.165 --> 07:23.099
Did you see that? I was so assertive.

07:24.219 --> 07:27.783
Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it.

07:27.784 --> 07:29.071
But Rainbow Dash...

07:29.072 --> 07:33.690
...just because you failed the sonic rainboom
a hundred thousand times in practice...

07:33.691 --> 07:37.238
...doesn't mean you won't be able
to do it in front of an entire stadium...

07:37.239 --> 07:41.176
...full of impatient,
super-critical sports fan ponies.

07:42.823 --> 07:45.395
What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me fail!

07:45.396 --> 07:47.903
The Wonderbolts will never
let a loser like me join.

07:47.904 --> 07:50.992
Princess Celestia will probably
banish me to the Everfree Forest!

07:51.092 --> 07:53.944
MY LIFE IS RUINED!!!

07:53.945 --> 07:55.314
Rar...

07:55.315 --> 07:58.928
Rare? The sonic rainboom is way more than rare!

07:58.929 --> 08:00.662
Rarity?

08:03.964 --> 08:05.493
Rarity! Are you...

08:05.813 --> 08:06.704
...flying?

08:06.705 --> 08:09.468
I most certainly am!

08:09.469 --> 08:11.204
Aren't my wings smashing?

08:11.205 --> 08:14.860
Twilight made them for me. I just adore them!

08:16.346 --> 08:17.576
Why so shocked?

08:17.577 --> 08:21.332
We couldn't leave our favorite flyer
without a big cheering section.

08:21.532 --> 08:22.241
"We"?

08:28.700 --> 08:31.582
I... I can't believe it!

08:31.682 --> 08:33.634
It's incredible.

08:33.635 --> 08:36.104
This is so cool! You guys made it!

08:36.105 --> 08:37.244
Sure did!

08:37.474 --> 08:38.405
WAIT!

08:42.126 --> 08:45.998
How'd you do that? Only
pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.

08:46.425 --> 08:47.559
Pretty cool, huh?

08:47.659 --> 08:50.099
I found a spell that makes temporary wings...

08:50.350 --> 08:52.477
...but it was too difficult to do more than once.

08:52.478 --> 08:56.085
So I found an easier spell that
lets the rest of us walk on clouds.

08:56.086 --> 08:58.276
And we came to cheer you to victory.

08:58.277 --> 09:04.198
To be honest, I *was* starting to get
just a teeniest, tiniest bit nervous.

09:04.199 --> 09:06.834
But I feel a lot better now
that you guys are here.

09:06.967 --> 09:09.636
Hey! We've got some time before the competition.

09:09.637 --> 09:11.951
Why don't Fluttershy and I
show you around Cloudsdale?

09:15.951 --> 09:19.516
Here it is. The greatest city in the sky!

09:30.702 --> 09:34.592
Some of the greatest pegasi
in history came from Cloudsdale.

09:34.765 --> 09:36.297
Oh! Wait for me!

09:39.731 --> 09:41.911
Those wings are gorgeous!

09:42.152 --> 09:43.648
Oh, why thank you.

09:44.996 --> 09:46.978
Be careful with those wings, Rarity.

09:46.979 --> 09:48.868
They're made from gossamer and morning dew.

09:48.869 --> 09:50.933
And they're incredibly delicate.

09:51.093 --> 09:56.122
Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get
worn out from too much attention.

09:56.412 --> 09:59.727
Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get
a look at where the weather's made.

09:59.927 --> 10:04.121
Great idea! Come on, girls!
To the weather factory!

10:09.296 --> 10:11.439
This is where they make the snowflakes.

10:11.550 --> 10:14.269
Each one is hoofmade, as you could see.

10:14.270 --> 10:16.277
It's a delicate operation.

10:16.857 --> 10:19.972
Ooh! The snowflakes look even better from up here.

10:29.993 --> 10:33.567
We better move on before Rarity
ruins winter and causes a drought.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.160
And here's where they make the rainbows.

10:47.243 --> 10:49.697
Spicy...!

10:49.897 --> 10:53.273
Yeah. Rainbows aren't really
known for their flavor.

10:55.081 --> 10:58.361
Where'd you get those
amazing wings? I want a pair.

10:59.161 --> 11:01.445
Yeah, I guess I could see that.

11:01.446 --> 11:04.979
Oh hey, look! It's Rainbow Crash again.

11:04.980 --> 11:07.159
Yeah! Rainbow...

11:09.143 --> 11:10.635
...Crash!

11:10.636 --> 11:14.436
Rarity! What are you doing
talking to *these* guys?

11:14.463 --> 11:17.368
Oh, they were just admiring
my wings, Rainbow Dash.

11:17.369 --> 11:22.604
Yeah. You should forget the sonic rainboom
and just get yourself some wings like these.

11:26.003 --> 11:27.560
Oh. Come on, girls.

11:27.661 --> 11:29.958
Why don't we go see how clouds are made?

11:30.788 --> 11:34.186
Don't listen to them. You're gonna
win that competition for sure.

11:34.375 --> 11:37.917
Are you kidding? I can't do the sonic rainboom.

11:37.918 --> 11:41.742
And just look at these boring
plain old feathered wings.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.054
I'm doomed.

11:56.793 --> 11:58.914
Why, these old things?

11:58.915 --> 12:02.505
Go ahead, everypony. Photos are encouraged.

12:05.170 --> 12:08.838
Rarity! We're supposed to be helping
Rainbow Dash relax, remember?

12:08.839 --> 12:11.277
Put your wings away and stop showing off.

12:11.443 --> 12:14.783
Oh. How can you ask me to put away perfection?

12:22.133 --> 12:24.390
Rainbow Dash, are you okay?

12:24.690 --> 12:25.897
You don't look so good.

12:26.337 --> 12:28.485
Of course! Why wouldn't I be okay?

12:28.565 --> 12:31.281
Everyone's so in love of Rarity's wings
that they won't even notice...

12:31.282 --> 12:34.628
...when I totally BLOW IT
in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.628
Hey! There's an idea!

12:36.629 --> 12:38.439
*You* should enter the competition.

12:38.440 --> 12:42.203
Yeah. I could watch you fly all day long.

12:42.564 --> 12:46.342
There really isn't anypony
who uses their wings quite like me.

12:46.686 --> 12:48.392
Perhaps I should compete.

12:48.563 --> 12:49.550
What?!

12:57.020 --> 12:58.502
What am I gonna do?!

12:58.503 --> 13:01.075
I'll never win the competition now.

13:18.513 --> 13:20.321
I'm going to be a while.

13:29.912 --> 13:33.864
Fillies and gentlecolts!
Please rise and join me...

13:33.865 --> 13:37.955
...in welcoming our beloved Princess Celestia!

13:43.711 --> 13:48.256
Please welcome our celebrity judges
for the Best Young Flyer Competition...

13:48.257 --> 13:51.520
...the Wonderbolts!

14:03.448 --> 14:06.907
And now let's find out who will take the prize...

14:06.908 --> 14:10.344
...as this year's Best Young Flyer.

14:10.544 --> 14:13.351
Okay, contestant number one. You're up.

14:18.153 --> 14:19.616
Okay, number two. Let's go.

14:19.816 --> 14:20.523
Um...

14:21.350 --> 14:23.578
Come on, come on. We ain't got all day.

14:26.103 --> 14:27.251
She's talking to you.

14:27.252 --> 14:28.763
Oh! Uh...

14:28.963 --> 14:30.384
Oh, I guess that's me.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.846
Okay, number four. Time to go.

14:39.337 --> 14:42.715
I'm number four and I need
just one more itsy bitsy minute.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.067
Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hm?

14:45.068 --> 14:48.905
Look. I don't care who it is,
but somepony's gotta go on.

14:48.906 --> 14:50.521
LET'S DO THIS!

14:52.261 --> 14:53.381
What am I gonna do?!

14:58.167 --> 15:02.176
I loved number seven. Doing fifteen
barrel rolls in a row can't be easy.

15:02.177 --> 15:05.824
My favorite is number ten.
She just looks like such a nice pony.

15:05.825 --> 15:09.010
Hm. Wonder how come we haven't
seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet.

15:09.011 --> 15:10.515
The competition's almost over.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.008
Number fifteen, let's go.

15:19.461 --> 15:20.590
Rarity...

15:20.732 --> 15:22.106
...is ready!

15:22.107 --> 15:26.232
Look, ladies, I don't know what to tell you.
There's only time for one more performance.

15:26.233 --> 15:29.068
If you both wanna compete, you'll
just have to go out there together.

15:29.069 --> 15:31.402
Well, Rainbow Dash? Shall we?

15:33.613 --> 15:36.458
And now, for our final competitor of the day...

15:36.459 --> 15:39.124
...contestant number fifteen!

15:39.125 --> 15:41.507
Uh... and apparently contestant number four.

15:44.132 --> 15:47.276
Good luck, Rainbow Dash. Just do your best.

15:47.903 --> 15:50.465
I hope you don't mind, but I took
the liberty of changing our music.

15:50.485 --> 15:54.061
That rock and roll doesn't really match my wings.

16:02.060 --> 16:04.301
Come on, Rainbow Dash. You can do this.

16:04.302 --> 16:05.976
Just remember the routine.

16:06.607 --> 16:07.665
Phase one...

16:23.417 --> 16:25.874
Nice work, Rainbow Crash!

16:34.381 --> 16:35.962
Time for phase two.

16:43.037 --> 16:45.523
Look. Phase two is working.

16:58.629 --> 17:02.806
And now, for my grand finale, I
will fly right up to the sun...

17:02.807 --> 17:06.843
...and beam my beautiful wings
over the whole city of Cloudsdale.

17:06.844 --> 17:09.427
Oh, they'll be talking about it for years!

17:11.272 --> 17:14.080
Looks like this is my last chance
to turn things around.

17:14.328 --> 17:16.866
Phase three: the sonic...

17:17.328 --> 17:18.427
...rainboom.

17:18.935 --> 17:21.249
Wings, don't fail me now.

17:32.503 --> 17:34.727
Look upon me, Equestria!

17:34.728 --> 17:38.107
For I am Rarity!

17:46.550 --> 17:47.962
Uh-oh.

17:49.449 --> 17:52.473
Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!

18:06.492 --> 18:07.820
Hold on, Rarity!

18:08.049 --> 18:09.439
I'm coming!

18:13.137 --> 18:14.204
I can't look.

18:32.298 --> 18:37.640
A SONIC RAINBOOM!!!
SHE DID IT! SHE DID IT! WAAAH!

18:46.486 --> 18:47.652
Whoa...

19:00.261 --> 19:01.949
A SONIC RAINBOOM!!!

19:01.950 --> 19:03.350
YEAH!!! YES!!!

19:04.503 --> 19:06.942
I did it. I did it!

19:07.724 --> 19:09.193
You sure did.

19:09.194 --> 19:12.805
Oh, thank you, Rainbow Dash. You saved my life.

19:12.806 --> 19:14.835
Oh yeah. I did that too.

19:15.544 --> 19:17.450
Best day ever!

19:22.508 --> 19:26.643
I want to apologize to all of you
for getting so carried away with my...

19:26.844 --> 19:28.347
...beautiful wings.

19:28.348 --> 19:30.076
I guess I just lost my head.

19:30.077 --> 19:32.456
-It's okay.
-Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo.
-We still love you.

19:32.556 --> 19:35.130
And then especially sorry
that I was so thoughtless...

19:35.131 --> 19:39.225
...as to jump into the contest at the last minute
after you would work so hard to win it.

19:39.507 --> 19:41.707
Can you ever ever forgive me?

19:42.012 --> 19:44.872
Oh, it's okay. Everything
turned our all right, right?

19:44.873 --> 19:47.893
I just wish I could have met
the Wonderbolts when they were awake.

19:50.742 --> 19:52.881
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh...!

19:53.001 --> 19:55.513
So you're the little pony who saved our lives?

19:55.514 --> 19:58.175
We really wanted to meet you and say thanks.

19:58.176 --> 20:00.281
...ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh...

20:01.302 --> 20:02.494
Princess!

20:04.090 --> 20:08.103
Hello, Twilight Sparkle. And hello to your friends too.

20:08.203 --> 20:12.236
Princess Celestia. I am sorry I ruined the competition.

20:12.329 --> 20:15.829
Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria.

20:16.185 --> 20:17.819
I know she is, my dear.

20:17.929 --> 20:23.250
That's why, for her incredible act of bravery
and a spectacular sonic rainboom...

20:23.251 --> 20:27.748
...I'm presenting the grand prize
for Best Young Flyer to this year's winner...

20:27.749 --> 20:29.963
...Miss Rainbow Dash!

20:30.720 --> 20:35.244
...ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmy
goshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!

20:35.290 --> 20:39.575
So, Twilight Sparkle. Did you learn anything
about friendship from this experience?

20:39.576 --> 20:43.801
I did, Princess. But I think Rarity
learned even more than me.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.394
I certainly did.

20:45.544 --> 20:48.856
I learned how important it is to
keep your hooves on the ground...

20:48.857 --> 20:50.867
...and be there for your friends.

20:50.968 --> 20:53.550
Excellent. Well done, Rarity.

20:54.767 --> 20:57.770
This really is the best day ever!

20:57.771 --> 21:00.337
-Uh... Hey, Rainbow Crash...
-Dash!

21:00.387 --> 21:02.726
Oh! Uh... Sorry. Rainbow Dash.

21:02.727 --> 21:05.998
Uh, we just wanted to congratulate you
on winning the competition.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.740
That sonic rainboom was awesome!

21:09.371 --> 21:10.414
Thanks, guys.

21:10.415 --> 21:13.801
Uh, we're really sorry we gave you
such a hard time before.

21:13.802 --> 21:16.288
Aw, that's okay. Don't worry about it.

21:16.289 --> 21:18.390
Hey, do you wanna hang out with us?

21:18.391 --> 21:21.028
Maybe you could show us
how you did that incredible trick?

21:21.029 --> 21:22.548
Sorry, boys...

21:24.248 --> 21:26.046
...but I've got plans.

21:29.813 --> 21:33.313
