<i>Hear ye, hear ye!</i>

00:05.940 --> 00:08.000
The first post-cutie
mark meeting

00:08.000 --> 00:11.340
of the Cutie Mark Crusaders
is now in session!

00:16.580 --> 00:17.680
Ahem.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.660
Oh! I'm sorry Apple Bloom.

00:20.040 --> 00:23.220
I was distracted by the
radiance of my cutie mark.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.400
Did you say something?

00:26.060 --> 00:30.960
I mean, it's pretty amazing
how the colors just pop off

00:31.020 --> 00:34.060
your flank. It's kinda
hard to look awa-

00:35.036 --> 00:38.137
Look. I know our cutie
marks are amazing.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.400
But is that all
we're gonna do now?

00:40.560 --> 00:43.580
Just spend our days staring
down at our own flanks?

00:44.260 --> 00:46.200
I guess not.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.500
Yeah. I suppose that
could get real boring.

00:52.880 --> 00:53.880
Yeah.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.480
This is ridiculous! We need
to go out and do somethin'!

01:00.080 --> 01:01.400
Wow. You're right!

01:01.620 --> 01:04.360
Yeah! We need to go try
new stuff like we used to!

01:04.560 --> 01:05.240
Exactly.

01:05.460 --> 01:06.740
Like square dancing!

01:10.400 --> 01:11.420
Or mountain climbing!

01:14.420 --> 01:16.860
Or square dancing on the
mountain we just climbed!

01:20.280 --> 01:21.020
Yeah!

01:21.240 --> 01:22.680
And the more things we try,

01:22.800 --> 01:25.580
the more chances we'll have to
finally get our cutie marks!

01:25.740 --> 01:26.720
Come on!

01:28.220 --> 01:29.900
Um... Apple Bloom?

01:43.720 --> 01:54.520

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
<i>Wow. Did we</i>
<i> really only ever do things</i>

02:19.040 --> 02:20.770
just to get our
cutie marks?

02:21.300 --> 02:22.640
I don't know. Maybe?

02:23.040 --> 02:25.420
Aw, come on. We
did lots of stuff

02:25.480 --> 02:27.960
that didn't have anything to
do with getting a cutie mark.

02:28.180 --> 02:29.120
Of course we did.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.460
Absolutely.

02:37.020 --> 02:40.200
Huh. So, now that we
don't have to do stuff

02:40.220 --> 02:41.240
to get our cutie marks,

02:41.520 --> 02:43.960
what is it that the Cutie
Mark Crusaders actually do?

02:46.880 --> 02:50.380
We do exactly what we
got our cutie marks in.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.340
Helping other ponies!

02:52.500 --> 02:54.360
Ponies without cutie marks!

02:54.460 --> 02:56.740
Or ponies who've forgotten
their special purpose!

02:56.840 --> 02:59.720
Exactly! We just
have to find ponies

02:59.780 --> 03:01.540
who need our help.
Come on!

03:06.480 --> 03:08.440
But are you sure
you feel content?

03:08.760 --> 03:09.640
Eeyup.

03:11.420 --> 03:14.040
Not even a tinge of
dissatisfaction?

03:14.340 --> 03:15.000
Nope.

03:17.900 --> 03:20.580
Not even the slightest
nagging sensation

03:20.620 --> 03:22.700
that you don't really know
what your purpose is in life

03:22.760 --> 03:25.260
or why you have a big
apple as a cutie mark?

03:30.700 --> 03:31.460
Nope.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.600
The important thing to remember

03:35.660 --> 03:37.480
is that there is no rush.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.240
The three of us tried
for the longest time,

03:40.640 --> 03:42.720
but it just comes
when it comes.

03:43.060 --> 03:45.220
And it's totally
normal to feel confused

03:45.300 --> 03:46.860
and maybe even
a little lost.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.720
But being a blank flank is
nothing to be ashamed of.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.080
So if you're having even
the slightest problem...

03:53.360 --> 03:55.230
Or concerns or questions...

03:55.520 --> 03:58.260
We want you to know that
we are here to help!

03:58.580 --> 04:01.680
I don't think they're too
worried about it yet.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.540
This is gonna be a lot
harder than I thought.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.740
Who knew there
were so few ponies

04:44.780 --> 04:46.350
worried about
their cutie marks?

04:46.660 --> 04:49.540
Kinda makes you wonder why
we made such a big deal

04:49.580 --> 04:50.780
out of it for so long.

04:53.280 --> 04:53.900
What?

04:54.320 --> 04:57.440
The point is, helping ponies
with cutie mark problems

04:57.480 --> 04:58.920
is what makes us special.

04:59.180 --> 05:01.640
But if we can't find
anypony with a problem...

05:01.940 --> 05:03.860
maybe we're not special.

05:04.760 --> 05:05.700
YEAH!

05:07.400 --> 05:08.960
I know exactly what you mean!

05:09.280 --> 05:11.060
You can't find a
cutie mark problem.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.220
I have a cutie mark
problem. It's so confusing

05:14.380 --> 05:15.540
and I feel like
the solution

05:15.580 --> 05:17.240
is staring me right
in the muzzle.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.540
What?

05:21.320 --> 05:24.040
I see why you guys hang
out here. It's cozy!

05:24.440 --> 05:29.920
The Crusader Clubhouse is a
safe place, Mr., um... Bulk.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.060
A place where we've faced all
kinds of cutie mark problems.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.640
A place where we'll go
on to solve even more,

05:35.860 --> 05:37.460
starting with yours!

05:37.780 --> 05:39.560
No matter how
long it takes.

05:39.780 --> 05:40.900
Or how hard it is.

05:41.220 --> 05:44.000
We'll solve it because
that's what we do!

05:44.320 --> 05:45.040
Yeah!

05:47.820 --> 05:48.820
YEAH!

05:49.680 --> 05:51.750
So what's your
cutie mark problem?

05:52.060 --> 05:55.660
Oh! Right! Uh, well, my
cutie mark is a dumb bell.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.580
But I've lifted every
dumb bell in Ponyville!

05:59.640 --> 06:03.020
Have you tried
lifting other things?

06:03.300 --> 06:04.760
You mean, not
dumb bells?

06:05.380 --> 06:05.840
Yeah.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.580
Yeah.

06:06.780 --> 06:07.480
YEAH!

06:09.740 --> 06:12.380
I mean, no. I hadn't
thought of that.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.200
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!

06:16.800 --> 06:18.840
But what happens when I
run out of other stuff?

06:20.040 --> 06:22.520
I guess you could teach
other ponies to lift things.

06:22.760 --> 06:23.860
Yeah!          Yeah.

06:23.940 --> 06:27.600
YEAH! Wow. You three really
have a knack for this!

06:28.260 --> 06:29.450
That was easy!

06:29.900 --> 06:32.220
Maybe too easy.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.380
What do you mean?

06:33.800 --> 06:36.240
Well, it's looking like
cutie mark problems

06:36.300 --> 06:37.720
are few and
far between.

06:38.020 --> 06:39.120
And?

06:39.340 --> 06:41.260
And what if we never
find another one?

06:41.640 --> 06:42.720
Well...

06:42.800 --> 06:45.600
And even if we do, we
could solve it so quick

06:45.640 --> 06:48.260
it'll be like it never
happened in the first place.

06:48.460 --> 06:49.660
So?

06:49.860 --> 06:52.560
Sooo... then the
Cutie Mark Crusaders

06:52.620 --> 06:54.820
don't have any
reason to exist!

06:59.200 --> 07:01.300
The problem
boils down to this.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.720
We don't need to go out
and do things anymore

07:03.780 --> 07:05.020
to get our
cutie marks.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.280
Right! And...

07:06.360 --> 07:08.760
Ponies with Cutie Mark
problems are hard to find.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.060
Exactly. But even
when we find problems,

07:12.180 --> 07:14.980
we're so good at solving
them that most of the time

07:15.020 --> 07:17.500
there's nothing for the
Cutie Mark Crusaders to do!

07:17.780 --> 07:21.520
So, I thought we should
start figuring out ways

07:21.560 --> 07:24.600
to search all of Equestria
for cutie mark problems!

07:25.700 --> 07:27.940
That kinda seems
like a lot.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.800
I don't think Rarity
would let me travel

07:30.840 --> 07:32.340
to the far reaches
of Equestria

07:32.380 --> 07:34.120
looking for cutie
mark problems.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.800
Yeah. I'm sure we'll come
across them in Ponyville.

07:37.060 --> 07:39.400
And when we do, we'll
totally solve them

07:39.460 --> 07:41.440
because we are so
awesome at it!

07:41.600 --> 07:42.280
Ha!

07:42.760 --> 07:44.990
But what do we
do until then?

07:45.480 --> 07:47.140
Maybe whatever
we want?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.300
What do you mean?

07:48.620 --> 07:51.220
Well, we used to only do
stuff to get our cutie marks

07:51.260 --> 07:53.870
or fulfil our destiny,
but now we don't have to.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.100
So, we can do
things just for fun?

07:57.580 --> 07:59.740
Are you girls thinking
what I'm thinking?

07:59.920 --> 08:00.880
Sure am!

08:01.180 --> 08:02.680
Scooting!
Singing!
Making
potions!

08:08.660 --> 08:11.640
Just remember: Stomp.
Kick. And roll.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.720
After this, you two are gonna
love scootering as much as me.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.420
If you say so.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.200
Ready? Stomp!

08:19.300 --> 08:20.140
Kick!

08:20.180 --> 08:21.760
AND ROLL!

08:22.120 --> 08:23.360
Whoo!

08:31.820 --> 08:32.580
<i> ♪ Ta-da! ♪</i>

08:35.460 --> 08:38.240
I don't
think I did it right.

08:42.020 --> 08:46.340
Doh...mi...soh

08:46.580 --> 08:47.820
It's just a
simple harmony.

08:53.460 --> 08:54.620
Harmony, huh?

08:56.040 --> 08:58.870
And, ah-one and ah-two
and ah-one, two, three...

09:01.780 --> 09:03.780
Wow. That was simple.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.360
It's just a dash and
a drop and a drip.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.680
Just a dash and a
drop and a drip.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.980
And even though Scootaloo
thinks bungee jumping

09:24.020 --> 09:25.160
is the bees knees,

09:26.660 --> 09:28.860
Sweetie Belle would
rather keep bees.

09:30.460 --> 09:32.000
Of course, I'm allergic.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.080
Who'd have thought
it would be so hard

09:34.120 --> 09:36.460
to find something for
us all to do together?

09:37.000 --> 09:41.400
Well, I know this might sound
crazy, but what if we didn't?

09:41.740 --> 09:42.520
Didn't what?

09:42.760 --> 09:46.160
Do things together. Well,
do everything together.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.400
But we're the Cutie
Mark Crusaders!

09:49.780 --> 09:53.240
And we always will be, but
I really wanna bungee jump.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.660
The speed! The height!
The fall!

09:56.000 --> 09:57.860
And I know you two
aren't interested,

09:57.920 --> 09:59.720
but I wanna try
crochet.

10:00.040 --> 10:00.940
Isn't there something

10:00.980 --> 10:02.540
you've always wanted
to do on your own?

10:06.660 --> 10:07.620
I don't know.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.400
I guess I figured we'd
always do stuff together.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.940
But bungee jumping
sounds just as scary

10:12.980 --> 10:14.540
as crochet
sounds boring.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.940
That's OK. Sweetie Belle and
I can do the things we like

10:18.140 --> 10:19.710
and you can do
whatever you like.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.900
Just as soon as you
figure out what it is.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.860
I guess.

10:23.960 --> 10:24.840
Great! Then we
can meet back here

10:25.220 --> 10:27.950
and talk all about
what we've done.

10:28.340 --> 10:29.890
But I don't know
what it'll be.

10:30.420 --> 10:31.520
You'll find something!

10:31.840 --> 10:33.220
Something awesome!

10:34.360 --> 10:37.660
Well, I
guess now I have to.

12:47.240 --> 12:51.660
One, two, three four.
Two, two, three, four--

12:51.740 --> 12:53.860
Whatever kind of
dancing y'all are doing,

12:54.040 --> 12:56.700
you're doing it
together and I want in!

12:59.540 --> 13:02.580
I-I mean uh,
would it be OK

13:02.640 --> 13:04.560
if I enrolled in
this dance class?

13:04.860 --> 13:07.680
Well, let's see
what you can do.

13:07.940 --> 13:10.660
We have a recital
at Town Hall tonight

13:10.720 --> 13:12.880
and a spot just
opened up.

13:12.940 --> 13:16.300
Tender Taps is a little
too shy to perform,

13:19.320 --> 13:23.360
but if you're ready to step
into a partnered routine...

13:23.600 --> 13:25.720
That sounds an awful
lot like friendship

13:26.000 --> 13:29.240
and I'm ready for anything I
don't have to do by myself.

13:29.560 --> 13:33.640
Well, then, dancing with
partner will be perfect.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.140
Whoaaaaaa!

13:50.900 --> 13:52.580
Whoa. Whoaaaaa!

13:55.820 --> 13:58.480
Whew. I feel like that
went pretty good but

13:58.700 --> 14:01.100
let's give it one more whirl
because it's important

14:01.120 --> 14:02.720
that I do a good
job partnering

14:02.780 --> 14:04.140
with my new group
of friends.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.960
Ehh. Now I'm think of it, you
might be better as soloist.

14:19.560 --> 14:23.460
Ehh, partnering is a
little advanced for you,

14:23.820 --> 14:26.860
but there's still lots
you can do on your own.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.940
I'm sorry, but doing
stuff on my own

14:29.960 --> 14:32.140
is exactly what
I don't want.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.910
Sorry it didn't
work out.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.640
Trying different things with
my friends was always fun,

14:43.080 --> 14:46.640
even when we were terrible.
Now it's just terrible.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.960
You weren't that bad; you just
need to learn a few things

14:50.000 --> 14:52.460
on your own. Being a
soloist can be fun.

14:58.390 --> 15:00.660
Ha!

15:02.680 --> 15:05.620
You just have
to do it with feeling.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.940
Thanks, but
without my friends,

15:13.280 --> 15:15.200
I don't think I'll
ever feel again.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.520
Good luck at
the recital.

15:17.980 --> 15:20.700
Oh, I'm not going do
that. I mean, I want to.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.950
It's kind of all
I think about.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.960
I bet someday my cutie mark
will even be about performing,

15:27.800 --> 15:30.080
but I could never dance
in front of an audience

15:30.120 --> 15:33.380
the way I do in class.
That's t-t-terrifying.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.560
Yeah. OK. Nice
meeting you.

15:38.180 --> 15:38.880
You, too.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.420
Sweetie Belle, you are
not going to believe this,

15:46.460 --> 15:47.960
but I think I like
bungee jumping

15:47.980 --> 15:49.620
even more than scootering!

15:50.240 --> 15:54.220
Seriously? That's
amazing. Look what I did!

15:55.140 --> 15:58.650
Wow. Uh. That's, um...

15:59.080 --> 16:03.620
Horrible! But it was so much
fun. Rarity showed me how,

16:03.760 --> 16:06.800
even though she says "crochet
is knitting's poorer cousin."

16:07.060 --> 16:08.340
But I loved it.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.480
Awesome!

16:12.660 --> 16:19.120
Oh. Hello, girls. Have fun
pursuing your own interests?

16:20.020 --> 16:22.680
Apple Bloom? What are you
doing sitting in the dark?

16:23.040 --> 16:25.080
Yeah. We thought
you'd be out looking

16:25.100 --> 16:26.250
for things you like to do.

16:26.660 --> 16:30.540
Oh, I did. I
looked all over town.

16:30.860 --> 16:34.620
I looked and I
looked and I looked

16:34.880 --> 16:36.600
and you know what I found?

16:37.520 --> 16:38.340
Nothing!

16:43.620 --> 16:45.520
You tried every
one of these?

16:46.560 --> 16:49.840
And each one just made me feel
more alone than the next.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.960
I don't see how I'm
supposed to be happy

16:52.000 --> 16:53.640
that we're not
hanging out anymore.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.110
Wait. I never said that.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.700
I just said we don't have
to do everything together.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.740
Like when there's something
one of us wants to do

17:00.780 --> 17:01.800
that the others don't.

17:02.500 --> 17:05.580
Oh. Well, I guess
that changes things.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.360
I can't believe
you thought

17:07.400 --> 17:09.380
we didn't want to
hang out anymore.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.580
I can't believe you
tried all this stuff

17:11.620 --> 17:13.260
and didn't find one
thing you liked.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.720
Well, I kind of
liked dancing.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.660
Mainly because it
looked like something

17:17.700 --> 17:20.900
you couldn't do alone, but
I wasn't very good at it.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.740
You don't have to be good
at something to have fun.

17:24.020 --> 17:26.420
And being good doesn't
always mean you will.

17:26.920 --> 17:30.700
I know. I met the best
dancer in the world,

17:30.760 --> 17:33.960
but he was so shy, he couldn't
bring himself to perform,

17:34.240 --> 17:36.500
even though he really,
really wanted to.

17:37.780 --> 17:42.020
I don't suppose this dancing
pony had a cutie mark, did he?

17:48.280 --> 17:49.140
You're here!

17:50.680 --> 17:51.600
SHHHHH!

17:55.780 --> 17:56.920
What are you doing here?

17:57.340 --> 18:00.370
You told me that you wanted to
perform more than anything,

18:00.700 --> 18:03.180
but I was too caught
up in myself to listen.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.560
You're the best
dancer I've ever seen

18:05.600 --> 18:08.500
and I'm here to convince you
to get out on that stage!

18:12.260 --> 18:14.120
Um, didn't I also
tell you

18:14.160 --> 18:16.880
that dancing in front of other
ponies is t-t-terrifying?

18:17.440 --> 18:18.580
I don't know if
you noticed...

18:18.640 --> 18:21.160
...but that auditorium
is full of other ponies!

18:21.320 --> 18:23.420
I can't go out there.
What if I'm bad?

18:23.780 --> 18:25.200
We can go on together.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.230
No matter what, you'll look
good dancing next to me.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.960
All right.
I'll do it.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.820
But I don't have my costume
and the backdrop is all wrong

18:37.860 --> 18:39.260
and we don't have
time to change it!

18:40.820 --> 18:42.660
Leave everything to us!

18:46.480 --> 18:48.680
I don't know about this.

18:48.860 --> 18:51.140
Don't worry. You'll
be just fine.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.460
Here goes nothing!

19:40.120 --> 19:42.360
You can't be any
worse than I was.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.120
I can't believe it!

20:30.280 --> 20:32.630
It's just what I always
imagined it would be!

20:32.840 --> 20:36.260
And if it weren't for all of
you, I wouldn't even have it.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.600
No problem. It's
what we do.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.600
I only wish I'd realized
what you needed right away

20:43.000 --> 20:45.240
instead of moping
around for no reason.

20:45.460 --> 20:48.160
Well, either way, I
hope you keep dancing.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.250
You know, I just might.

20:54.460 --> 20:57.280
It sure is a lot of fun
and I'm pretty confident

20:57.300 --> 20:58.420
I can only get better.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.360
I'm sorry I was so silly about
us all doing our own things.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.490
If we hadn't, I might have
never even tried dancing.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.440
Or find out I
needed help.

21:09.860 --> 21:12.300
With each of us going out and
trying things on our own,

21:12.400 --> 21:14.880
we'll be three times as likely
to find ponies to help.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.880
And trying new stuff
might even make us better

21:18.220 --> 21:19.780
at helping them, like how
I used my bungee jumping

21:19.840 --> 21:21.000
to change the sets.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.240
Or my crochet to
make the costumes.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.520
Well, one thing
is for sure:

21:25.820 --> 21:28.460
The Cutie Mark Crusaders
will never be the same.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.520
We'll be better!

21:31.720 --> 21:32.740
YEAH!
