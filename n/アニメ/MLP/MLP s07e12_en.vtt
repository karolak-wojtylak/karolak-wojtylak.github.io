00:08.042 --> 00:09.975
Care for a carrot
ginger sandwich?

00:10.477 --> 00:11.375
Ohh.

00:11.477 --> 00:14.346
You remembered to cut
off the crusts for me.

00:16.849 --> 00:18.050
Of course I did.

00:18.751 --> 00:20.152
I know how you like them.

00:25.158 --> 00:27.426
You really do make
the best finger foods.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.163
What do you say?

00:31.465 --> 00:32.765
Excuse me!

00:33.167 --> 00:35.300
Oh! I really can't
take them anywhere.

00:39.139 --> 00:41.273
Can I trouble you for
another sugar cube?

00:43.043 --> 00:46.712
Oh, no. I'm so sorry,
but I seem to be out.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.314
[pop] Well, I can just
pop us in some more.

00:49.416 --> 00:50.214
Oh that's all right.

00:50.616 --> 00:52.484
I need to go to
the market anyway.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.387
I have to restock my pantry
for our tea party next week.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.490
Oh, I never realized
how much work you put

00:58.492 --> 01:00.359
into hosting these
tea parties.

01:04.097 --> 01:06.365
Oh, it's really
not that much.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.866
No, no, no, no, no.

01:07.968 --> 01:10.335
I've been taking advantage
of your hospitality

01:10.437 --> 01:11.603
for far too long.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.872
It's high time I do
something about it.

01:14.874 --> 01:17.477
What to do... What to do...?

01:18.379 --> 01:20.880
Why don't you host
the next tea party?

01:21.882 --> 01:22.780
I've got it!

01:22.882 --> 01:26.285
Why don't I host the next
tea party at my place?

01:26.387 --> 01:28.087
Hey, that's my idea.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.223
Why didn't I see
that coming?

01:32.892 --> 01:36.593
[escaping air hiss]

02:14.334 --> 02:15.767
So Fluttershy...

02:16.969 --> 02:18.537
what do you think of
my brilliant,

02:18.639 --> 02:20.506
genius, amazing idea

02:20.608 --> 02:23.275
of having the next tea
party at my place?

02:27.514 --> 02:28.312
Are you sure?

02:28.614 --> 02:30.482
I wouldn't want you to
go through any trouble.

02:30.784 --> 02:34.152
You, trouble? Never!
I insist.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.727
Then count me in.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.695
I'm already looking
forward to it!

02:44.097 --> 02:45.364
Me, too!

02:45.566 --> 02:47.766
I'm so excited; I can't wait.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.236
No, really! I can't.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.973
How about we have the tea
party tomorrow afternoon?

02:54.675 --> 02:55.673
Sounds good to me.

02:55.875 --> 02:59.378
You know, Discord, I've never
been to your house before.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.115
Well, that's OK, because I've
never hosted a tea party before.

03:05.452 --> 03:08.287
Oh? I've never hosted
a tea party before.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.554
So much to do!

03:10.656 --> 03:12.691
Thank you so much for
the tea and nibblies,

03:12.793 --> 03:14.460
but I really must be going.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.161
Uh, Discord...

03:16.263 --> 03:19.631
before you go, would you
mind helping me tidy up?

03:22.736 --> 03:23.534
There you go.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.537
Back to normal, just
the way you like it.

03:25.839 --> 03:26.872
See you tomorrow!

03:28.241 --> 03:29.975
I can't wait!

03:32.779 --> 03:36.348
OK, since Fluttershy always
goes out of her way

03:36.450 --> 03:38.283
to host the perfect
tea party for me,

03:38.385 --> 03:40.485
how do I make my
tea party for her

03:40.587 --> 03:42.187
even more perfect?

03:42.389 --> 03:45.924
I'm sorry dearie, were
you talking to me?

03:46.126 --> 03:48.660
Actually, Madam, I'm
talking to myself.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.662
Well, I'm not
talking to you!

03:50.864 --> 03:52.464
It's for Fluttershy.

03:52.666 --> 03:53.765
Oh, all right.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.534
No more holes though.

03:56.136 --> 03:59.404
You have to knock this tea
party out of the park for her.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.740
She was our first
friend, after all.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.609
You don't have to
tell<i> me</i> that.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.412
She gave us a chance
when no other pony would!

04:06.614 --> 04:09.348
She makes us want to be
a better draconequus.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.284
Fluttershy deserves
the best of everything.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.753
Of course. I should get her
the best of everything!

04:15.055 --> 04:16.321
Why didn't I think of that?

04:17.557 --> 04:19.491
Well, are you going
to answer me or not?

04:19.693 --> 04:20.759
Me?

04:20.961 --> 04:22.661
I thought you were
talking to--

04:24.063 --> 04:24.930
--No time!

04:25.332 --> 04:28.967
I'm off to prepare a tea
party worthy of Fluttershy!

04:33.640 --> 04:35.107
Excuse me.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.676
Is this where Fluttershy
usually buys her tea?

04:37.978 --> 04:39.478
Why, yes it is.

04:39.880 --> 04:40.778
Oh, wonderful!

04:41.080 --> 04:43.081
I'll be enjoying her
company tomorrow,

04:43.183 --> 04:46.885
so I will be needing your
very best tea, please.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.721
Something especially special.

04:49.023 --> 04:52.624
I'm sure Fluttershy would enjoy
some of our Rosehip green tea.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.393
Oooh. Interesting.

04:54.495 --> 04:58.230
Does it decorate your hips
in roses or turn you green?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.165
Uh, neither?

05:00.267 --> 05:01.700
It just tastes good.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.068
How boring.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.403
Pass.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.372
Hold on!

05:07.674 --> 05:09.074
Ginseng tea.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.476
Now that sounds promising.

05:11.678 --> 05:12.511
What does it sing?

05:12.913 --> 05:16.415
I'm partial to something
upbeat and jazzy.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.852
Again. It's just tasty,
like all of our tea here.

05:20.354 --> 05:24.089
So.. all this is just
tea you simply drink?

05:24.391 --> 05:25.090
Uh-huh.

05:25.592 --> 05:28.660
Oh! Seems that I got
here just in time.

05:35.035 --> 05:35.933

05:36.235 --> 05:39.171
Are you sure you're
friends with Fluttershy?

05:39.373 --> 05:42.040
You seem so very
different from her.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.709
Well, of course
we're friends.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.478
She gets me and you
obviously do not.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.280
"Are you sure you're
friends with Fluttershy?"

05:49.382 --> 05:51.149
Why, the very nerve.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.653
I'm sorry, do you validate?

05:57.356 --> 05:58.456
Hello.
Gah!

05:59.625 --> 06:01.927
Uh, can I help you
find something?

06:02.029 --> 06:05.631
Yes you can. Your
finest tea set, please.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.433
I want only the best for
my friend, Fluttershy.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.536
Uh,<i> you're</i> friends
with Fluttershy?

06:13.239 --> 06:16.608
Yes, judge-y clerk pony.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.208
Why is it such a surprise?

06:18.310 --> 06:20.645
Sure, she's on the quieter
side and I'm a bit,

06:20.747 --> 06:22.381
well, more showy..

06:22.583 --> 06:25.083
but I'll have
you know, we're besties.

06:25.285 --> 06:28.621
And that's why I need
the BEST TEA SET!

06:29.823 --> 06:31.390
Perhaps then you'd
be interested

06:31.492 --> 06:33.492
in our classic
"Tea for Two" set.

06:36.662 --> 06:38.597
A teapot that just pours tea?

06:38.699 --> 06:40.499
How positively dreadful.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.568
But that's all tea pots
are supposed to do.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.237
Not anymore!

06:47.907 --> 06:49.241
Much better.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.410
Don't wrap it;
I'll walk it home.

06:56.215 --> 06:58.250
Now let's see, I
have the perfect tea

06:58.352 --> 07:00.218
and the perfect tea service.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.587
What else do I need for
the perfect tea party?

07:03.289 --> 07:03.855
Oh!

07:04.157 --> 07:05.724
Decorations, of course!

07:07.927 --> 07:12.364
Good, but not nearly good
enough for Fluttershy.

07:13.701 --> 07:14.833
Ta da! choo!

07:16.769 --> 07:17.669
Oh, ho ho!

07:18.171 --> 07:19.238
Better.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.141
Oh, I'll need napkins.

07:22.443 --> 07:23.842
I'll simply make them...

07:23.944 --> 07:25.143
I could...

07:25.245 --> 07:26.845
or ...nope.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.380
I've got nothing.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.649
How do I make these better?

07:30.851 --> 07:32.017
What should I do?

07:32.319 --> 07:33.252
Make them...

07:33.654 --> 07:34.920
make them glow.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.923
That's not good
enough for Fluttershy.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.025
Should I make them fly?

07:40.427 --> 07:43.195
Glow, fly and fold!

07:43.497 --> 07:47.366
Glow, fly, fold into
fun shapes perhaps?

No, it has to be even
better than perfect!

08:08.521 --> 08:09.488
Oh, Discord.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.324
You're waaaay
over-thinking things.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.960
All you have to do is make
Fluttershy feel comfortable,

08:15.262 --> 08:16.728

pretty easy for you!

08:16.930 --> 08:18.063

But all I did was make it

What if those ponies at the tea
shop and china shop were right?

09:48.622 --> 09:51.056
What if Fluttershy sees how
crazy this place is

09:51.358 --> 09:53.425
and realizes how
different we are

09:53.627 --> 09:55.860
and then doesn't
want to be friends anymore?

09:58.565 --> 10:00.899
Relax. We can fix this.

about my dear friend

11:10.837 --> 11:13.004
is that she loves

But not on the ceiling.

never discussed it,

12:14.200 --> 12:15.133
You don't mean...

12:15.435 --> 12:17.135
Mhmm!

12:17.337 --> 12:18.937
Make-over!

12:22.642 --> 12:23.775
Hating it.

12:28.447 --> 12:29.681
Hating it.

12:33.652 --> 12:34.919
Hating it.

12:37.523 --> 12:40.758
Hating ... how
much I love it!

12:52.839 --> 12:53.505
Agh!

12:56.242 --> 12:59.443
OK, let's give these
conversation cards a whirl.

12:59.545 --> 13:00.779
Ahem.

13:00.881 --> 13:04.048
It is very nice
to see you today.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.120
Have you read any
good books lately?

13:09.722 --> 13:13.391
Your garden looks
positively lovely.

13:17.262 --> 13:18.263
Right on!
Great!

13:19.765 --> 13:22.000
Oh, quite strange, for
the first time in my life,

13:22.102 --> 13:24.002
I don't feel quite strange.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.706
In fact, I feel...
completely normal.

13:28.108 --> 13:32.410
Everything is finally
perfect for Fluttershy.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.447
And just in time.

13:38.349 --> 13:41.987
Discord! I'm so excited to
finally see where you live.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.322
Greetings, friend.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.957
Please do come in.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.928
I can't wait to see how...oh.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.400
Is something amiss?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.268
Um. No, no,
not at all.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.437
It's just.. not
what I expected.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.373
It's quite... lovely.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.309
Please, have a seat.

14:04.711 --> 14:05.543
Where is it?

14:05.845 --> 14:06.978
Right here.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.081
Oh.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.884
I think you'll be quite
pleased with the green tea

14:12.986 --> 14:15.019
I've selected for us today.

14:15.121 --> 14:18.022
Oooh! Does it actually
turn us green?

14:18.224 --> 14:20.525
Is it really envious
of the other teas?

14:20.827 --> 14:21.893
What's it do?
What's it do?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.763
Uh well... it tastes
delicious.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.065
Oh. OK.

14:30.502 --> 14:33.071
What particularly nice
weather we're having.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.907
Yes. Yes we are.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.945
It did rain the
other day, however.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.114
Uh-huh.

14:42.616 --> 14:45.451
But the weather today
is particularly nice...

14:46.353 --> 14:48.953
as I previously
mentioned.

14:51.123 --> 14:53.291
Would you care for
some milk toast?

14:53.593 --> 14:57.428
Uh.. Discord, you don't
seem to be yourself today.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.230
Are you feeling
all right?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.066
What ever do you mean?

15:01.668 --> 15:05.336
Well, it's just...
what you're wearing.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.338
And also, what
you're saying.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.207
And.. also the way
you're saying it.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.109
And um, pretty much
everything else.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.244
Oh, dear Fluttershy.
Worry not.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.979
I can assure you that
for the first time,

15:15.181 --> 15:17.315
I'm feeling perfectly normal.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.517
Now let me top you off.

15:20.019 --> 15:20.885
Whoops!

15:21.087 --> 15:22.286
Butter fingers.

15:22.488 --> 15:23.688
How embarrassing.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.358
Uh...what's going on?

15:30.229 --> 15:32.530
I have no idea...

15:32.732 --> 15:35.834
[gasp] Discord! You're
starting to fade away!

15:36.136 --> 15:38.303
Oh. You don't say.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.772
Have you read any
good books lately?

15:49.249 --> 15:49.848
Huh!

15:50.750 --> 15:52.048
Have you tried
the scones?

15:52.150 --> 15:53.885
They're positively
delectable.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.187
The secret is in
the extra butter.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.122
What is wrong with you?

15:58.324 --> 16:01.926
You're acting so "normal"
which is not so normal for you!

16:02.328 --> 16:03.728
W-What ever do you mean?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.197
This is just me.. being me.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.166
No, it's not!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.602
It's you being like
everypony else!

16:15.507 --> 16:16.206
Eeep!

16:16.308 --> 16:18.343
The more you do it the
more you fade away!

16:19.745 --> 16:21.079
Of course!

16:21.181 --> 16:23.281
You're a creature of
pure chaos!

16:23.383 --> 16:25.716
Being normal is
destroying you!

16:26.551 --> 16:28.286
Oh, haha, how interesting.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.589
That reminds me of something I
heard at the market today.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.126
STOP IT! Please.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.729
You need to go back to being
your not-normal normal self!

16:38.031 --> 16:41.399
Quick, Discord, do something
chaotic before it's too late!

16:41.601 --> 16:42.467
Please!

16:42.769 --> 16:44.202
Do something chaotic?

16:44.404 --> 16:45.970
I'll try....

16:47.039 --> 16:50.041
Ohh, that's not good.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.643
Oooh. Then I guess it's up to me.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.645
Uh, OK. All right.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.546
How about...?

16:58.551 --> 16:59.617
Oh, no.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.386
I tipped over that cup!

17:01.988 --> 17:04.188
That's pretty chaotic, right?

17:06.159 --> 17:07.425
Ooh. What if I...?

17:10.830 --> 17:13.031
Oh, my! Talking with food
in my mouth

17:13.133 --> 17:17.902
after taking a bite from every
sandwich... how wacky!

17:19.238 --> 17:20.271
Doing anything for ya?

17:22.174 --> 17:23.942
Oh... OK. Hmmm.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.010
Maybe I need to start
thinking like you.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.780
Ooooh. What would Discord do?

17:29.382 --> 17:32.216
Well, I guess he'd probably
make another version of himself

17:32.418 --> 17:33.951
to bounce ideas off of.

17:36.188 --> 17:37.321
But one wouldn't be enough.

17:37.423 --> 17:38.890
He'd need more. Way more.

17:46.865 --> 17:50.034
Hey there, Fluttershys, any
ideas on how to Discord-up

17:50.136 --> 17:51.202
this tea party?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.704
Hi Fluttershy,
thanks for asking!

17:53.906 --> 17:56.074
First of all, you gotta
redecorate this place!

17:56.176 --> 17:58.943
I mean this is where Discord
lives! And you're telling me

17:59.045 --> 18:01.746
there aren't any stairs
that lead to nowhere?

18:02.148 --> 18:02.781
On it!

18:17.028 --> 18:19.730
Better, but it still
needs something.

18:23.835 --> 18:25.670
Now that's more like it!

18:28.775 --> 18:29.807
It's working!

18:30.742 --> 18:32.143
OK, what else?

18:32.245 --> 18:33.277
Furniture on the ground?

18:33.579 --> 18:34.577
So predictable!

18:34.679 --> 18:36.515
Let's put them where
they don't belong.

18:47.258 --> 18:49.927
And he'd have a chaise lounge
that would actually chase you

18:50.029 --> 18:51.629
because he's funny like that.

18:52.231 --> 18:53.564
I bet you can't catch me!

18:58.738 --> 19:00.037
Ha ha ha ha!

19:04.310 --> 19:06.777
Oh, and Discord would have
a special kind of tea,

19:06.979 --> 19:09.314
like a ginseng that
could really sing!

19:09.916 --> 19:11.716
I would! I-I would!

19:13.853 --> 19:15.451
<i> ♪ La, la, la, la! ♪</i>

19:15.553 --> 19:17.322
<i> ♪ Lala lala la la! ♪</i>

19:17.624 --> 19:20.058
And he'd serve it
on a floating table!

19:20.260 --> 19:21.258
We've never talked about it,

19:21.360 --> 19:23.361
but I'm pretty sure
Discord hates gravity.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.530
I do! Who wants to be
tethered to the ground

19:26.932 --> 19:28.466
when you can do this?

19:29.868 --> 19:34.139
Haha! Now this is exactly
what I was hoping for!

19:35.141 --> 19:36.808
This is what you
were hoping for?

19:37.210 --> 19:40.078
But this is the complete
opposite of your tea parties.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.314
I wouldn't expect you to throw
a tea party the way I would!

19:43.516 --> 19:44.648
We're different.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.483
I know.

19:46.985 --> 19:49.920
I was afraid that if you saw
exactly how different we are,

19:50.022 --> 19:51.922
you wouldn't want to
be friends anymore!

19:52.524 --> 19:53.191
What!?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.560
Why would you ever
think that?

19:55.962 --> 20:00.865
Because... you and I don't
make sense to anypony else.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.168
That may be true, but
we make sense to me.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.937
I never would have thought
to make singing ginseng

20:07.039 --> 20:08.173
before I met you.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.609
But you've opened me up to so
many more possibilities

20:11.711 --> 20:13.377
and impossibilities!

20:13.579 --> 20:15.746
So I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

20:15.848 --> 20:19.283
I like you<i> because</i> you're
so different from me.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.585
You do?

20:20.987 --> 20:22.887
Of course I do, silly.

20:23.089 --> 20:26.624
Besides, what's Discord
without a little chaos?

20:26.926 --> 20:30.995
Well.. in that case, I certainly
don't need to be wearing this.

20:32.698 --> 20:33.296
Whoops!

20:33.498 --> 20:36.367
Haha. I forgot that I
still had this on.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.705
Now, about that tea party...

20:42.408 --> 20:45.943
You know, your garden
really is looking lovely.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.646
Why, thank you for noticing.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.749
I also couldn't help but
notice that you need a refill.

20:54.453 --> 20:55.720
Aie! Achoo!

20:57.256 --> 20:58.423
Gesundheit!

20:59.025 --> 21:01.225
It really is nice
having you here.

21:01.527 --> 21:02.925
I'm happy to be here.

21:03.127 --> 21:07.598
And I really do like your
place...<i> because</i> it's so you.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.934
Why thank you, Fluttershy.

21:10.336 --> 21:11.969
Now, how about we
try some of those

21:12.071 --> 21:14.204
delicious-looking
sandwiches?

21:16.007 --> 21:16.807
Ha ho!

21:16.909 --> 21:18.275
You read my mind.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.716
<i> ♪ La, la, la, la! ♪</i>

21:25.818 --> 21:28.085
<i> ♪ Lala lala la la! ♪</i>

21:31.824 --> 21:32.657
Yahoo!
