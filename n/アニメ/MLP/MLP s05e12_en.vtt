00:06.100 --> 00:07.338
You know the worst thing about

00:07.370 --> 00:09.077
you being the Princess of Friendship?

00:09.243 --> 00:10.442
The dishes.

00:11.270 --> 00:12.832
Thanks for taking
care of that, Spike.

00:12.860 --> 00:14.533
After three events in one week,

00:14.570 --> 00:16.810
I really needed to
relax with a good book.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.329
It's kinda funny, isn't it?

00:19.618 --> 00:22.580
All these ponies coming to you
for advice about friendship.

00:22.597 --> 00:24.350
What's funny about that?

00:24.368 --> 00:26.370
Well, you know, cause
you used to be famous

00:26.384 --> 00:27.590
for being such a bad friend.

00:28.954 --> 00:32.208
What are you talking about? I
had good friends in Canterlot.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.267
Come on, Twilight,
look at the wall.

00:35.306 --> 00:38.030
Do you see any photos from
before we moved to Ponyville?

00:38.039 --> 00:40.305
And look at you now. The
Princess of Friendship.

00:43.701 --> 00:45.290
This is a disaster!

00:45.413 --> 00:47.960
All my old friends. I can't
remember any of their names

00:47.978 --> 00:50.120
right now, but do you
really think that they think

00:50.135 --> 00:51.267
I'm a bad friend?

00:51.419 --> 00:54.253
Well, I only meant that
you've come so far.

00:54.282 --> 00:55.780
You're a great friend now and--

00:55.790 --> 00:58.690
Oh, I feel terrible! I've
got to make it up to them.

00:59.098 --> 01:01.680
Pack a bag, Spike! We're
going to Canterlot!

01:02.690 --> 01:05.107
And make a list of
my friends' names.

01:06.230 --> 01:08.990
Aw, me and my big mouth.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.576
Regular subtitles by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

01:51.606 --> 01:52.603
Come on, Twilight.

01:52.618 --> 01:54.060
You're getting worked
up about nothing.

01:57.298 --> 01:59.913
The only logical place to
start is at the beginning.

02:07.661 --> 02:08.750
Whoa...

02:09.655 --> 02:11.458
It's exactly
how we left it.

02:15.292 --> 02:17.987
Look! It's "Predictions
and Prophesies!"

02:18.050 --> 02:20.289
And it's still opened to
the Elements of Harmony!

02:22.855 --> 02:25.570
And here's that present I
was gonna give Moondancer!

02:25.850 --> 02:27.840
Eh, guess she won't be needing that.

02:28.276 --> 02:30.886
Hey, look! The rest
of it's still here!

02:34.086 --> 02:35.883
How could I have
let this happen?

02:38.966 --> 02:40.473
Come on, Twilight.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.683
Princess Celestia gave
you an assignment.

02:43.015 --> 02:44.830
No pony could blame
you for that.

02:45.292 --> 02:47.286
But look at the way
I left this place.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.784
It's a total mess!

02:51.033 --> 02:53.126
Just like how I
left my friendships.

02:54.338 --> 02:56.892
I've got to make it up to-

02:58.256 --> 03:01.660
Oh, uh, Minuette,
Twinkleshine, Lemon Hearts,

03:01.716 --> 03:03.680
Lyra Heartstrings,
and Moondancer.

03:03.993 --> 03:05.704
Yeah. Them.

03:12.965 --> 03:15.740
Spike! Come on!
We've got work to do!

03:18.186 --> 03:20.440
Have you been awake all night?

03:20.693 --> 03:22.860
I did a little research
and I think I know

03:22.888 --> 03:24.230
where we can find Minuette.

03:24.616 --> 03:25.708
That is one of my
friends, right?

03:33.036 --> 03:36.437
Uh, it's not too late to
forget I opened my big mouth.

03:36.618 --> 03:39.350
No, Spike. I'm glad you
opened your big mouth.

03:39.354 --> 03:41.482
These ponies have
probably been suffering

03:41.493 --> 03:44.400
ever since I left, wondering
why their supposed friend

03:44.410 --> 03:46.042
would treat them so badly.

03:49.066 --> 03:50.005
Minuette?

03:50.554 --> 03:54.180
Twilight Sparkle,
you old so-and-so!

03:54.208 --> 03:57.400
What are you doing
here? Hey, Spike!

03:57.696 --> 03:59.130
Look at these wings, huh?

03:59.541 --> 04:02.340
Hey, grab a picture of me
and the Princess, will you?

04:02.533 --> 04:05.258
I tried to tell my coworkers
we used to be friends

04:05.264 --> 04:08.053
back when, but they've
never believed me.

04:14.165 --> 04:16.760
Wait wait wait; really
fluff 'em up, huh?

04:21.141 --> 04:23.000
So what are you doing here?

04:23.018 --> 04:24.938
I mean, I know you're
here all the time,

04:24.949 --> 04:26.590
but you never come to see me!

04:27.029 --> 04:29.829
Hey! I just had
the greatest idea!

04:29.834 --> 04:32.400
You want to go see Lemon
Hearts and Twinkleshine?

04:32.688 --> 04:35.088
Of course! My old friends!

04:35.173 --> 04:39.008
It'll be great!
Come on, let's fly!

04:39.306 --> 04:40.922
Get it? Heh-heh-heh.

04:41.221 --> 04:42.394
This is perfect!

04:42.565 --> 04:44.928
I can apologize to all
three of them at once!

04:45.136 --> 04:47.568
Let's hope they're not as
traumatized as Minuette.

04:56.768 --> 05:00.790
She did! Twinkleshine
literally spit out her oats

05:00.821 --> 05:03.098
when she heard you were the
Princess of Friendship!

05:03.242 --> 05:06.670
We saw you at the coronation.
That was some shindig!

05:07.168 --> 05:07.770
You did?

05:08.186 --> 05:10.000
Sure! We see you all the time.

05:10.389 --> 05:12.660
You remember our old
friend Lyra, right?

05:13.312 --> 05:14.912
She lives in Ponyville, too.

05:15.034 --> 05:17.146
We're always over
there visiting her

05:17.157 --> 05:18.810
or she's coming over here.

05:19.914 --> 05:21.792
We've thought about
asking you to join us

05:21.802 --> 05:22.680
from time to time,

05:22.690 --> 05:25.376
but we just sorta
figured you'd moved on.

05:26.490 --> 05:27.498
Oh.

05:29.660 --> 05:32.186
So what brings you by, anyway?

05:32.480 --> 05:34.240
All those times you've
come back to Canterlot,

05:34.304 --> 05:36.330
you've never had
donuts with us before.

05:36.661 --> 05:38.906
Well, uh, you see...

05:41.136 --> 05:42.794
I came to apologize.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.010
For what?

05:45.429 --> 05:46.853
Before I left Canterlot,

05:46.880 --> 05:49.580
I didn't really
appreciate my friends.

05:49.973 --> 05:51.242
And that's because I didn't know

05:51.264 --> 05:53.170
how important friendship was.

05:53.354 --> 05:56.555
But I've learned so much
since I moved to Ponyville.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.120
I learned what it means
to be a good friend

05:59.680 --> 06:02.020
and that I certainly wasn't
one to the three of you.

06:02.528 --> 06:07.040
So, for all the pain I caused
you, I am truly sorry.

06:13.765 --> 06:16.218
Aw, come on, Twilight!

06:16.517 --> 06:19.290
Sure, it might've stung a
little bit when you ran off

06:19.306 --> 06:21.498
to Ponyville without
saying goodbye,

06:21.674 --> 06:24.210
but it's not like we weren't
used to that from you!

06:24.224 --> 06:26.580
Yeah, we didn't
take it personally.

06:26.933 --> 06:28.980
But it's really
good to see you now.

06:29.136 --> 06:32.442
Hey! Anypony up for a
blast from the past?

06:40.474 --> 06:42.336
It's our old science lab!

06:42.741 --> 06:45.136
I have so many great
memories of this place.

06:46.304 --> 06:48.650
Remember when Lemon
Hearts got her head stuck

06:48.672 --> 06:49.780
in that beaker?

06:59.930 --> 07:01.173
...but according to this book,

07:01.205 --> 07:04.050
you're supposed to add the
sodium chloride first.

07:04.533 --> 07:07.274
I read ahead and to
make a proper salt lick,

07:07.285 --> 07:09.420
you need to add
the molasses first.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.501
Well, I read ahead
too, Moondancer,

07:12.517 --> 07:15.560
and I'm sure it said
sodium chloride first.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.570
Oh, I've got the wrong
book. That's so hilarious.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.611
Whatever happened to Moondancer?

07:26.730 --> 07:27.740
Moondancer?

07:28.208 --> 07:30.210
Yeah, you know,
our other friend.

07:30.762 --> 07:35.280
Oh right, Moondancer!
I remember her!

07:35.296 --> 07:37.066
I wonder what she's up to.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.312
Yeah, I always liked her.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.030
We just sort of lost
touch after you left.

07:42.309 --> 07:45.530
I think she went to live out
by the stadium, didn't she?

07:45.760 --> 07:46.874
Well, let's go see!

07:52.640 --> 07:54.370
I think this is the place.

07:54.714 --> 07:56.565
Didn't used to look
like this, though.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.960
Moondancer?

08:16.533 --> 08:18.890
What do you want?
I'm trying to study.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.690
It's us! Your old friends--

08:23.088 --> 08:23.920
Ugh!

08:28.864 --> 08:31.050
That's old
Moondancer, all right!

08:31.082 --> 08:32.840
She always did like her books.

08:33.194 --> 08:36.040
Hey, kinda like you
used to be, huh?

08:36.464 --> 08:38.346
Exactly how I used to be.

08:53.824 --> 08:57.050
Come on, Twilight, we've been
watching her for three days!

08:57.274 --> 09:00.538
Library, house. Library,
house. That's it.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.986
Nopony looks at
her or says hello

09:02.992 --> 09:04.330
or even gives her a smile.

09:04.693 --> 09:06.277
It's like she
doesn't even exist!

09:06.624 --> 09:08.080
Was she always like this?

09:08.192 --> 09:09.770
Well, she always
was a little shy.

09:09.898 --> 09:11.792
But for a while there she
was really starting to

09:11.802 --> 09:12.682
come out of her shell.

09:13.024 --> 09:14.640
Remember when she
threw that party?

09:16.778 --> 09:19.882
Oh,right. I think you might
have been busy that day.

09:24.394 --> 09:26.080
There you are, Twilight!

09:26.442 --> 09:28.618
Moondancer is having
a little get-together

09:28.624 --> 09:30.660
in the west castle
courtyard. You wanna come?

09:31.258 --> 09:35.541
Ooh, sorry girls. I got a lot
of studying to catch up on.

09:43.968 --> 09:45.898
Thought she might finally
be letting her guard down

09:45.909 --> 09:47.050
a little with that party.

09:47.589 --> 09:49.765
We invited her out a
few times after that,

09:49.952 --> 09:52.218
but she was always
too busy studying.

09:52.613 --> 09:55.013
So eventually we
just stopped asking.

09:55.301 --> 09:58.128
I had no idea that party
was so important to her.

10:00.688 --> 10:02.965
I've got to find a way
to make it up to her!

10:20.860 --> 10:25.066
Oh my gosh! Moondancer? Is that--?

10:25.061 --> 10:25.820
SSSSSHHHHH!

10:30.389 --> 10:32.752
Moondancer? Can I talk
to you for a min--

10:32.757 --> 10:33.253
SSSSSHHH!

10:37.296 --> 10:38.197
What is this?

10:38.522 --> 10:40.149
Eh, a bubble of silence.

10:40.517 --> 10:41.696
I haven't seen
you in a while

10:41.712 --> 10:43.520
and I thought it might
be nice to catch up.

10:44.037 --> 10:44.842
For what purpose?

10:46.341 --> 10:48.474
You know. Cause we're friends.

10:51.098 --> 10:52.064
SSSSSHHHHH!

10:58.949 --> 11:00.453
I'm really sorry to bother you.

11:00.688 --> 11:03.237
I was just hoping we could go
outside and talk for a bit.

11:10.709 --> 11:12.544
I'm sorry I skipped your party.

11:12.602 --> 11:13.072
AAH!

11:13.626 --> 11:15.994
SSSSSHHHHH!

11:17.488 --> 11:20.688
Why won't you leave me
alone? I'm trying to study!

11:20.981 --> 11:23.941
You've got the wrong pony.
I don't have parties.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.072
You did once.

11:25.312 --> 11:27.170
And I was so caught
up in my own studying

11:27.184 --> 11:29.072
that I didn't take your
feelings into account.

11:29.269 --> 11:31.114
Look, Twilight Twinkle--

11:31.200 --> 11:31.744
Sparkle.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.517
Whatever. I just need to be
alone so I can study

11:34.661 --> 11:37.573
without some crazy pony trying
to make friends, all right?

11:37.914 --> 11:38.672
Fine.

11:39.258 --> 11:39.946
Wait.

11:40.106 --> 11:42.538
How did you get into
my book like that?

11:46.208 --> 11:48.293
I've been studying a
new studying technique.

11:48.352 --> 11:50.106
I can only do it
for a few minutes,

11:50.192 --> 11:52.053
but you'd be amazed how
much you can pick up

11:52.069 --> 11:53.760
when you're
actually in a book!

11:54.005 --> 11:55.552
That's one of Haycart's methods.

11:55.573 --> 11:56.837
You know Haycart?

11:56.944 --> 11:58.586
Of course! He's a genius!

11:58.709 --> 12:01.178
I have a copy of his "Treatise
on Ponies," you know.

12:06.096 --> 12:07.744
What is this place?

12:08.544 --> 12:12.752
This is where I used to live.
You mean I never had you over?

12:12.901 --> 12:16.100
A first edition of
"Principles of Magic"!

12:16.896 --> 12:18.800
Hey. Didn't I
give this to you?

12:19.941 --> 12:21.216
Maybe?

12:21.397 --> 12:24.101
I did! Look, I even wrote
something:

12:24.122 --> 12:26.373
"To my friend,
Twilight Sparkle.

12:26.608 --> 12:28.880
Thanks for introducing
me to the classics."

12:29.178 --> 12:31.584
I can see by the fact
that you left it here

12:31.600 --> 12:33.150
that it meant a lot to you.

12:33.685 --> 12:35.301
Look, I didn't
bring you over here

12:35.317 --> 12:38.421
for even more poignant reminders
of what a bad friend I was.

12:38.474 --> 12:40.480
I brought you here
to give you this.

12:41.253 --> 12:43.136
You can come here
whenever you want

12:43.274 --> 12:45.072
and study to your
heart's content.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.272
Really?

12:46.709 --> 12:49.525
But first you've got
to do something for me.

12:49.861 --> 12:50.800
What?

12:50.965 --> 12:53.173
Have dinner with our
old friends tonight.

12:53.893 --> 12:56.677
I can't; I'm reorganizing
my biology scrolls.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.605
I've been spending a lot of time
with Minuette, Twinkleshine,

12:59.610 --> 13:02.496
and Lemon Hearts since I've been
back. They really miss you.

13:02.581 --> 13:05.578
Look, I already told you,
the last thing I need

13:05.610 --> 13:07.264
is a bunch of ridiculous
friend-making

13:07.274 --> 13:08.618
keeping me from studying.

13:10.229 --> 13:11.504
Moondancer, wait!

13:11.722 --> 13:13.413
A wise pony once taught me

13:13.440 --> 13:15.456
that there's more to life
than dusty old books.

13:15.776 --> 13:17.962
I tried friendship and
it's just not for me.

13:18.261 --> 13:19.584
Now if you'll excuse me.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.824
What if I taught you
Haycart's method?

13:30.768 --> 13:33.850
So, uh, what are you
studying these days?

13:33.984 --> 13:36.346
Science. Magic. History.
Economics. Pottery.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.498
Things like that.

13:37.632 --> 13:41.296
Yowza! You plannin' on being
a professor or something?

13:41.456 --> 13:42.272
No.

13:42.901 --> 13:45.477
So you're just...studying?

13:45.706 --> 13:46.586
Can I go now?

13:46.650 --> 13:48.026
Moondancer, please.

13:48.064 --> 13:49.504
It's all right, Twilight.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.325
We're having a good
time. Right, everypony?

13:55.669 --> 13:59.253
So, uh,Spike, tell
Moondancer that story about

13:59.274 --> 14:02.128
how Twilight had to read a
book about doing a sleepover.

14:02.901 --> 14:04.853
"Slumber 101"? I've read that.

14:05.077 --> 14:09.120
Oh, heh-heh, really?
Well, uh, did you know

14:09.301 --> 14:12.357
Lemon Hearts here works
at the Canterlot palace?

14:12.432 --> 14:15.898
Yeah, it's true. I do
the big events, mostly.

14:16.069 --> 14:18.048
State dinners, that
sort of thing.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.895
Ugh!

14:30.010 --> 14:34.165
Moondancer! You've got to
give friendship a chance!

14:34.293 --> 14:37.882
I gave friendship a
chance a long time ago.

14:37.957 --> 14:41.210
It didn't work out then. It
isn't going to work out now.

14:41.861 --> 14:44.026
Twilight? Are you all right?

14:45.466 --> 14:47.738
No. No, I'm not.

14:51.061 --> 14:52.666
Wh-where are you going?

14:52.858 --> 14:55.744
I don't know, Spike, I really
messed this one up.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.920
That party was
everything to her.

14:58.256 --> 15:00.304
I can only imagine what
it must have felt like

15:00.325 --> 15:01.792
when I didn't show up.

15:06.682 --> 15:09.536
Hey, Moondancer! Look
at this spread, huh?

15:09.781 --> 15:11.434
Thank you so much for coming!

15:11.530 --> 15:15.456
Of course! We wouldn't miss one
of our best friend's parties!

15:15.738 --> 15:17.509
Is Twilight coming?

15:23.637 --> 15:25.990
Oh. OK.

15:26.442 --> 15:29.824
Hey, we'll still
have fun, right?

15:31.248 --> 15:32.130
Sure.

15:40.186 --> 15:42.810
If there was only a
way to undo the damage.

15:44.229 --> 15:45.701
I know what I need to do.

15:46.016 --> 15:48.058
And I know just who can help me!

16:01.514 --> 16:04.378
Huh. Guess they must have
gone back to Ponyville.

16:05.242 --> 16:06.949
Wheeee!

16:09.829 --> 16:11.360
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

16:13.472 --> 16:18.101
That was AWESOME! We gotta go
flying more often, Twilight!

16:18.464 --> 16:19.520
There you are!

16:19.701 --> 16:22.610
I thought you threw in the
ol' towel and headed home!

16:22.848 --> 16:25.482
I did head home, but not
to throw in the towel.

16:25.626 --> 16:29.330
I went to get my secret
weapon. Minuette, meet--

16:29.354 --> 16:31.221
Hey, Pinkie Pie!

16:31.333 --> 16:32.405
Hi, Minuette!

16:33.813 --> 16:36.773
Twilight, you didn't say
Minuette would be here!

16:37.370 --> 16:38.544
You two know each other?

16:38.592 --> 16:41.605
Oh, sure! She was one of
Cadance's bridesmaids.

16:41.621 --> 16:43.866
We hang out all the time
when she's in Ponyville.

16:43.888 --> 16:44.933
Didn't you know that?

16:45.029 --> 16:48.832
Hah! And you call yourself
the Princess of Friendship!

16:49.970 --> 16:51.482
Twilight briefed me
on the way here.

16:51.493 --> 16:52.640
We'll need fifteen
bags of confetti

16:52.666 --> 16:54.170
and as many hooves
as we can get.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.890
Let's go! We can pass by
the donut place on the way!

16:57.626 --> 16:59.034
And what are we gonna do?

16:59.232 --> 17:00.298
Just come with me.

17:09.765 --> 17:12.997
Oooh, "A Brief History
of the Wagon Harness"!

17:16.997 --> 17:19.904
"The Life and Times of
Marwari the Maneless"?

17:38.074 --> 17:39.152
What is this?

17:39.440 --> 17:41.333
It's a party. For you.

17:43.776 --> 17:45.136
SURPRISE!

17:47.152 --> 17:48.144
Come on in!

17:48.821 --> 17:51.578
Uh, thanks, but no thanks.
I don't do parties.

17:54.853 --> 17:57.269
I know. And I think
it's my fault.

17:57.296 --> 17:59.381
Back when we were
in school together,

17:59.413 --> 18:00.970
you invited me to a party.

18:01.002 --> 18:03.856
I was so focused on my
studies that I didn't show up.

18:04.202 --> 18:05.541
Big deal.

18:05.770 --> 18:07.082
It was a big deal.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.984
And now that I realize how
important friendship is,

18:10.016 --> 18:12.794
I'd like to make up for my
mistake with a new party.

18:14.341 --> 18:17.660
A party in honor of
my friend, Moondancer!

18:18.554 --> 18:21.786
Please, you've got to let
me make this up to you.

18:23.717 --> 18:26.458
And you think this is
going to do it, huh?

18:26.624 --> 18:28.341
Er, Yes?

18:28.506 --> 18:30.341
Well, sure, why wouldn't it?

18:31.018 --> 18:33.525
That was only the first time I
ever put myself out there

18:33.642 --> 18:35.936
and then you didn't
even bother to show up!

18:36.400 --> 18:38.410
Then you left town
without saying goodbye,

18:38.592 --> 18:40.634
even though we were
supposed to be friends.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.970
I was humiliated! I felt
like I wasn't important!

18:45.024 --> 18:48.336
I never wanted to let myself
be hurt like that again!

18:48.666 --> 18:52.074
Those three finally convinced
me that I had value!

18:52.138 --> 18:55.360
That other ponies might like
me and want to be my friend!

18:55.402 --> 18:58.448
And YOU! DIDN'T! SHOW! UP!

19:10.682 --> 19:14.090
You're right; this party can't
make up for the way I hurt you.

19:14.325 --> 19:17.040
But please, don't let my
mistake be the reason

19:17.061 --> 19:19.232
you can't be friends
with anypony else.

19:22.330 --> 19:23.680
We were your friends then,

19:23.760 --> 19:26.405
and we'd be honoured
to be your friends now!

19:35.642 --> 19:40.992
What? That's the librarian,
the book seller, my sister!

19:41.093 --> 19:43.840
You've got a lot of
friends, Moondancer.

19:46.090 --> 19:47.536
I'm sorry, Moondancer.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.928
I've faced magical creatures,
the end of Equestria...

19:50.960 --> 19:52.480
all sorts of things.

19:52.778 --> 19:55.320
But seeing how my
actions affected you,

19:55.893 --> 19:58.469
that was one of the worst
feelings I've ever had.

20:03.226 --> 20:04.490
Thank you, Twilight.

20:04.933 --> 20:07.866
I never realized how much
I needed to hear that.

20:19.189 --> 20:22.661
Now come on, everypony!
Let's party!

20:22.746 --> 20:23.616
Right?

20:23.685 --> 20:24.496
Right!

20:47.589 --> 20:50.160
I think it's time for
us to go, Moondancer.

20:50.762 --> 20:53.189
Thank you for helping me
make some new friends.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.264
Even if they are
my old friends.

20:56.949 --> 20:58.570
We'll come back and visit soon.

20:58.794 --> 21:00.048
That would be great!

21:00.250 --> 21:02.954
You've still got to teach
me that Haycart technique.

21:03.152 --> 21:03.706
Deal.

21:03.936 --> 21:07.258
Um, Moondancer? It
got kinda banged up,

21:07.250 --> 21:09.258
but here's a little
something I wanted to give you

21:09.274 --> 21:10.336
back at your first party.
