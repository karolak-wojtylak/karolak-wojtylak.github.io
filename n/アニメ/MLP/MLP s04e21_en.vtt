WEBVTT

00:02.829 --> 00:05.789
The magical properties of this
spell will only have lasting

00:05.791 --> 00:07.045
effects if you focus on--

00:07.998 --> 00:10.064
No! Rainbow Dash!

00:11.596 --> 00:13.449
How in Equestria does
that pony expect to pass

00:13.455 --> 00:15.125
her History of the
Wonderbolts exam tomorrow

00:15.133 --> 00:16.702
if she's wasting time flying?

00:18.119 --> 00:19.537
I'm just gonna fly
right up to her

00:19.549 --> 00:20.366
and tell her what I think

00:20.370 --> 00:22.476
about her lackadaisical
approach to studying.

00:22.747 --> 00:24.095
Won't she be surprised.

00:24.126 --> 00:24.735
Surprise!

00:24.780 --> 00:26.618
What? Huh?
How did you?

00:26.739 --> 00:28.146
Please, Twilight.

00:28.353 --> 00:30.230
That was the worst
sneak attack ever.

00:31.871 --> 00:32.565
What? But--

00:32.667 --> 00:34.967
I saw you giving me the
stink eye from the ground.

00:35.135 --> 00:38.095
And heard you flying towards me
and muttering from a mile away.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.507
Well, if you heard me
muttering then you must know

00:40.515 --> 00:41.705
what I was muttering about.

00:41.988 --> 00:44.405
Yeah, yeah, the
Wonderbolts History test.

00:44.684 --> 00:45.730
No big deal.

00:47.631 --> 00:48.868
No. Big Deal.

00:49.079 --> 00:50.009
Really Big
Deal.

00:50.078 --> 00:50.883
It's a test!

00:51.047 --> 00:52.612
A test that will
determine if you can join

00:52.620 --> 00:54.468
the newly formed
Wonderbolts Reserves.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.275
And being part of the
Wonderbolts Reserves

00:56.282 --> 00:57.309
means you'll have
the opportunity

00:57.311 --> 00:58.864
to live your dream
as a Wonderbolt.

00:59.090 --> 01:01.490
This is the most important
test of your life!

01:01.701 --> 01:04.440
Twilight, not everypony
gets all freaked out

01:04.450 --> 01:05.748
about tests like you.

01:06.142 --> 01:08.956
I do not get all
freaked out about tests.

01:09.504 --> 01:10.762
Uh, seriously?

01:11.334 --> 01:14.546
Your freak-outs are so epic you
sing whole "freak-out" arias

01:14.552 --> 01:15.440
about freaking out.

01:16.150 --> 01:19.652
Fine. I may tend to take my
tests a little seriously.

01:20.105 --> 01:22.790
But that doesn't mean you
shouldn't be studying for yours.

01:24.224 --> 01:27.235
Oooh! And I know just the
pony who can help you!

01:29.114 --> 01:29.812
Me!

01:30.050 --> 01:32.023
This is going to
so much fun!

01:35.611 --> 01:37.531
Sure. Fun.

01:45.400 --> 01:50.400
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies

02:18.515 --> 02:19.525
Agh! Wha?

02:19.720 --> 02:20.236
Hunh?

02:20.540 --> 02:22.232
This is the most complete--

02:22.347 --> 02:23.916
And ginormous!

02:24.122 --> 02:26.001
<i>book on the History</i>
<i>of the Wonderbolts.</i>

02:26.764 --> 02:29.662
OK, but how am I supposed
to get what's in there...

02:30.042 --> 02:31.086
Into here?

02:31.820 --> 02:34.749
With my handy dandy Study
Checklist, of course.

02:35.299 --> 02:36.370
Of course.

02:37.207 --> 02:39.395
First up: Reading
and Highlighting.

02:40.905 --> 02:42.692
Reading and highlighting
is the foundation

02:42.704 --> 02:44.138
of any good study method.

02:44.524 --> 02:46.716
It allows the student to
hone in and boil down

02:46.720 --> 02:47.982
what's really important,

02:48.216 --> 02:49.990
separating the
good from the bad,

02:50.056 --> 02:52.909
<i>the wheat from the chaff,</i>
<i>getting to the crux of things.</i>

02:53.445 --> 02:55.059
Let's see what
you've got so far.

02:55.285 --> 02:56.349
Um...

02:56.878 --> 02:57.426
Huh?

02:58.111 --> 03:00.540
By highlighting everything,
you don't really

03:00.552 --> 03:03.422
separate the wheat
from the chaff.

03:04.776 --> 03:06.774
Or the good from the bad.

03:07.957 --> 03:10.113
Hey. I am not that tall!

03:15.061 --> 03:16.240
OK, Rainbow.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.182
Clearly reading and highlighting
is not your style of studying.

03:19.479 --> 03:21.660
<i>So let's move on to</i>
<i>the tried and true.</i>

03:22.614 --> 03:23.631
History Lecture!

03:26.632 --> 03:27.537
Yes, Rainbow?

03:28.485 --> 03:29.910
Is it snack time?

03:30.446 --> 03:30.850
No.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.419
Recess?

03:32.560 --> 03:33.036
No.

03:34.146 --> 03:36.702
Can't we just watch the History
of the Wonderbolts movie?

03:37.285 --> 03:38.080
No!

03:38.485 --> 03:40.930
Now just get comfortable
and experience...

03:41.994 --> 03:43.886
the magic of learning.

03:45.215 --> 03:46.095
Ahem!

03:46.427 --> 03:48.520
Prior to the great
Celestia/Luna Rift,

03:48.803 --> 03:51.754
there was no need for the
Earth, Unicorn, Pegasi,

03:52.056 --> 03:53.672
or E.U.P.--Guard.

03:54.751 --> 03:56.460
<i>But after Luna's banishment,</i>

03:56.595 --> 03:58.899
<i>the Protective Pony</i>
<i>Platoons</i> were formed.

03:59.818 --> 04:02.444
<i>On the anniversary of the</i>
<i>first Celestial Year of Peace,</i>

04:02.684 --> 04:04.308
a celebration was held.

04:06.794 --> 04:08.376
Headed by General Firefly...

04:08.600 --> 04:10.965
<i>An elite team of aerial</i>
<i>performers were chosen</i>

04:10.979 --> 04:13.309
<i>to help commemorate this</i>
<i>auspicious occasion.</i>

04:13.918 --> 04:16.251
The first performance
was so full of energy,

04:16.450 --> 04:19.845
so highly charged, that magical
lightning showered down

04:19.851 --> 04:20.606
on the crowd.

04:20.856 --> 04:23.381
<i>Everypony was so filled</i>
<i>with amazement and wonder</i>

04:23.598 --> 04:27.239
that General Firefly dubbed
them the Wonderbolts.

04:31.960 --> 04:32.829
Rainbow Dash!

04:33.002 --> 04:35.069
Can you repeat
any of my lesson?

04:55.943 --> 04:57.139
History lecture?

04:57.689 --> 04:59.264
Nope.

04:59.369 --> 05:02.240
OK, Rainbow...Rainbow?

05:02.864 --> 05:03.797
Rainbow Dash!

05:04.757 --> 05:05.235
Here.

05:06.255 --> 05:11.334
Let's move on to my favorite
style of learning: Flashcards.

05:12.692 --> 05:16.647
Ooh! Does that mean
I'll learn in a flash?

05:17.465 --> 05:18.788
One can only hope.

05:20.942 --> 05:23.654
Colonel Purple Dart, the leader
of the Wonderbolts in the

05:23.736 --> 05:25.473
4th Celestial Era was
known for his...

05:26.107 --> 05:26.762
Wha?

05:27.469 --> 05:29.438
Rainbow, did you
see what happened?

05:29.890 --> 05:34.267
What? No! I was riveted by
your captivating cards.

05:34.958 --> 05:36.005
Hmmmm.

05:36.829 --> 05:39.008
After becoming the
official flying squadron

05:39.014 --> 05:41.465
for Princess Celestia, she
honored them with...

05:42.031 --> 05:42.813
Gotcha!

05:43.371 --> 05:43.982
Got what?

05:46.446 --> 05:49.047
The original Wonderbolts
lightning bolt insignia was...

05:49.324 --> 05:50.080
Ah!

05:51.221 --> 05:52.160
Rainbow Dash.

05:52.173 --> 05:53.332
You could have hurt me.

05:54.177 --> 05:56.282
With a spit wad? Really?

05:56.569 --> 05:59.127
A spit wad to the eye would
have been no laughing matter.

06:01.582 --> 06:03.209
Well, if you can horse
around like this,

06:03.399 --> 06:05.469
then you clearly must
be ready for the test.

06:06.081 --> 06:06.675
Clearly!

06:07.278 --> 06:09.756
Well then, I guess you're
also ready for a...

06:11.410 --> 06:12.667
pop quiz.

06:12.885 --> 06:13.691
Bring it!

06:15.797 --> 06:18.503
The initials E.U.P.
stand for what?

06:18.975 --> 06:20.665
Ernie's Undercooked Pancakes.

06:20.856 --> 06:23.149
The original aerial
team performed for...

06:23.307 --> 06:25.121
Celestia's Cereal
Celebration.

06:25.914 --> 06:29.096
The Wonderbolts were given their
name by this famous Pegasus.

06:29.414 --> 06:30.279
Who is she?

06:30.831 --> 06:32.169
Please don't say Colonel Waffle.

06:32.710 --> 06:35.929
Hello? General
Blazing Donut Glaze.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.550
So, did I ace it or what?

06:40.911 --> 06:42.120
Or what.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.534
You didn't get one
answer correct.

06:44.801 --> 06:46.362
What? But how?

06:46.600 --> 06:47.471
I don't know.

06:47.578 --> 06:49.116
I've never heard
answers so wrong.

06:49.603 --> 06:51.127
And so breakfast related.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.205
If you had taken the
official test today...

06:55.652 --> 06:58.120
My dreams of being
in the Wonderbolts Reserves

06:58.132 --> 07:00.025
would've been totally crushed.

07:01.094 --> 07:02.282
What am I gonna do?

07:02.456 --> 07:03.789
I'm running out of time!

07:03.861 --> 07:05.385
I don't know any
of this history!

07:05.945 --> 07:08.487
I'm going to fail!

07:12.796 --> 07:15.912
I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna
fail, I'm gonna fail.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.140
And it's all your fault!

07:18.259 --> 07:19.186
My fault?

07:19.498 --> 07:21.000
I'm the one helping you.

07:21.656 --> 07:23.082
Maybe your famous
"study methods"

07:23.092 --> 07:24.450
aren't all they're
cracked up to be!

07:24.587 --> 07:25.730
Eh, teacher?

07:26.903 --> 07:29.931
Excuse me, I've used them
to study for many a test

07:29.949 --> 07:31.094
and passed.

07:31.447 --> 07:32.801
Yeah, right.

07:33.051 --> 07:35.773
Do you know the name of the
premiere Wonderbolts choreographer?

07:36.263 --> 07:37.535
Uh, well...

07:37.894 --> 07:39.566
Commander Easy Glider.

07:39.820 --> 07:42.575
Do you know how many Pegasi
flew in the original squad?

07:43.098 --> 07:43.615
Um...

07:43.873 --> 07:44.452
Seven!

07:44.776 --> 07:47.715
Do you know Princess Celestia's
favorite flight pattern?

07:48.183 --> 07:50.569
The Icaranian Sun Salutation.

07:50.794 --> 07:53.143
See? I could
pass the test.

07:53.658 --> 07:54.158
Fine.

07:54.323 --> 07:55.555
Rub it in, why
don't you?

07:55.797 --> 07:59.293
Besides, I don't see why I have
to take this lousy test anyway.

07:59.547 --> 08:02.080
I've proven I'm one of
the best fliers around.

08:02.308 --> 08:05.071
Knowing their origin and being
able to properly represent them

08:05.084 --> 08:07.765
for all of Equestria
is just as important.

08:08.019 --> 08:08.989
Yeah, right.

08:09.178 --> 08:11.471
<i>Some history buff like you</i>
<i>must've made that up</i>

08:11.484 --> 08:13.065
to bring us fliers down.

08:13.305 --> 08:16.130
Knowing history actually
is beneficial, Rainbow.

08:17.352 --> 08:19.141
Beneficial for eggheads.

08:19.270 --> 08:19.912
Girls.

08:19.980 --> 08:22.954
Well, this egghead knows
history and can fly.

08:23.254 --> 08:25.057
Maybe I should
become a Wonderbolt.

08:25.141 --> 08:27.701
Just 'cause you've got wings
doesn't mean you can fly.

08:27.777 --> 08:28.489
Girls!

08:28.579 --> 08:30.759
You're barely able to
just get off the ground.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.249
Girls! Stop!

08:36.288 --> 08:38.823
Now, is that any way
to talk to a friend?

08:41.274 --> 08:42.005
Sorry.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.226
Yeah, sorry.

08:44.796 --> 08:46.641
Don't you have more
important things to do?

08:46.831 --> 08:49.139
Like prepare Rainbow
for her big test?

08:49.719 --> 08:51.223
I've tried everything,
Fluttershy,

08:51.457 --> 08:53.508
but none of my study
methods work for her.

08:54.119 --> 08:56.704
Well, no offense to your
teaching methods, Twilight,

08:56.837 --> 08:58.926
but I think I may have
a way to help Rainbow.

09:03.047 --> 09:04.497
Oh! Who's that?
Who's that?

09:04.883 --> 09:07.734
Celestia and Luna, back
when they were happy.

09:29.363 --> 09:30.199
Now what?

09:30.526 --> 09:35.106
Gummy's an Earth Pony; Winona's
a Unicorn and Tank is a Pegasus.

09:35.455 --> 09:36.476
They're the E.U.P.

09:36.563 --> 09:38.183
helping to protect
the Princess.

09:42.021 --> 09:43.531
How are you
getting all this?

09:52.350 --> 09:53.137
Oh no!

09:58.948 --> 10:00.222
Stop, stop, stop!

10:00.452 --> 10:01.157
That was aw--

10:01.160 --> 10:02.048
Awesome!

10:02.142 --> 10:04.977
I give it three "Woo hoos"
Woo hoo, Woo hoo, Woo hoo!

10:05.112 --> 10:06.690
And an extra "Woo"
for good measure.

10:06.835 --> 10:07.601
Woo!

10:07.941 --> 10:11.142
Well, I give it a
"Whoa, whoa, what?"

10:11.186 --> 10:14.312
I'm totally confused and
I just want to go home.

10:14.378 --> 10:15.765
Whoa! Hey!

10:16.150 --> 10:17.680
Whoa, your woes,
there Woeful.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.869
Someponies learn through
theatrical presentation.

10:20.056 --> 10:23.045
But other ponies learn
through musical intervention.

11:24.181 --> 11:24.880
Now!

11:26.179 --> 11:28.378
And I am just the
pony to help.

11:29.584 --> 11:31.859
Rarity. You look ridiculous.

11:32.035 --> 11:35.043
I'm going to ignore that comment
out of my desire to help you.

11:36.552 --> 11:37.441
Good luck.

11:39.514 --> 11:42.731
Get ready, Rainbow Dash,
for I am going to take you

11:42.747 --> 11:46.228
on an historical
adventure in fashion.

11:47.080 --> 11:51.155
I am now modeling the rather
unattractive, and frankly,

11:51.248 --> 11:54.058
itchy original Wonderbolts'
flying costume.

11:54.823 --> 11:57.935
Fortunately, thanks to the
vision of Flair de Mare,

11:58.132 --> 12:00.899
the Wonderbolts ensemble
became more streamlined

12:01.043 --> 12:02.831
in a wonderfully
breathable fabric.

12:03.342 --> 12:07.137
Of course, there were
fashion hits and misses.

12:08.554 --> 12:11.121
<i>Just look at those</i>
<i>dreadful bell bottoms.</i>

12:11.250 --> 12:13.036
<i>What were ponies thinking?</i>

12:13.340 --> 12:13.974
I don't know.

12:14.156 --> 12:16.554
I bet General Flash
rocked these things.

12:16.708 --> 12:18.522
Ah! Pinkie! You're real!

12:18.671 --> 12:19.514
Of course I'm real.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.523
I mean, I'm not the
real General Flash,

12:21.594 --> 12:22.963
the 10th leader of
the Wonderbolts.

12:23.162 --> 12:24.919
But I, Pinkie, am really real.

12:25.246 --> 12:28.753
And I'm Admiral Fairy Flight,
from the 7th squadron.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.474
And of course, you recognize
Commander Easy Glider.

12:32.899 --> 12:34.636
And I'm sportin' some
sort of get-up worn

12:34.641 --> 12:36.277
by Colonel Purple Dart.

12:37.937 --> 12:39.244
Just look at us.

12:39.416 --> 12:40.671
Look at us.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.017
Look at me!

12:42.132 --> 12:43.943
It's too much for my eyes!

12:44.288 --> 12:46.081
Now, don't you fret, Rainbow.

12:46.386 --> 12:47.646
This fashion show nonsense

12:47.654 --> 12:49.334
wouldn't help me
learn nothin' either.

12:51.240 --> 12:51.732
Really?

12:51.959 --> 12:54.796
Well, what special study
trick do you have, AJ?

12:55.274 --> 12:55.799
Who me?

12:56.308 --> 12:57.385
Oh, I got nothin'.

12:57.615 --> 12:58.396
Aw.

12:58.661 --> 13:01.182
Why, I could tell you every
little thing there is to know

13:01.196 --> 13:02.585
about the history of Apples.

13:02.803 --> 13:05.112
But I picked all that up
over years in the field

13:05.313 --> 13:06.374
as a labor of love.

13:06.928 --> 13:08.056
How much time you got?

13:08.470 --> 13:09.479
Twelve hours.

13:09.783 --> 13:11.892
Oh, then you are up a creek.

13:14.901 --> 13:18.124
Well, I think we should just go
back to old-fashioned studying.

13:18.528 --> 13:19.847
What about our play?

13:22.074 --> 13:23.791
Just look at these costumes.

13:23.992 --> 13:26.940
Surely something resonates
with your inner Wonderbolt.

13:27.209 --> 13:29.240
And Granny Smith discovered
the first Granny Smith

13:29.256 --> 13:31.498
in Phillydelphia when
she was just a filly.

13:31.783 --> 13:34.122
<i>♪ Commander Easy Glider was</i>
<i>the real cream of the crop. ♪</i>

13:34.483 --> 13:37.295
Pinkie, stop rapping! That
isn't going to help Rainbow.

13:37.568 --> 13:40.206
<i>♪ Well, I suggest you put down</i>
<i>your silly cards of flash. ♪</i>

13:40.382 --> 13:41.623
<i>♪ For I know that</i>
<i>they cannot help ♪</i>

13:41.631 --> 13:43.157
<i>♪ our good friend</i>
<i>Rainbow Dash. ♪</i>

13:48.372 --> 13:49.363
Enough!

13:49.830 --> 13:50.524
No rapping.

13:50.649 --> 13:51.338
No cards.

13:51.408 --> 13:52.101
No costumes.

13:52.150 --> 13:52.920
No play.

13:53.890 --> 13:55.404
And no apples!

13:56.124 --> 13:57.925
I am never going
to pass this test.

13:58.150 --> 13:58.684
Ever!

13:59.235 --> 14:00.640
Just forget it.

14:15.377 --> 14:17.393
Rainbow, I'm sorry
about all that.

14:17.804 --> 14:19.383
We didn't mean to
overwhelm you.

14:19.761 --> 14:22.226
It's OK. You were
just trying to help.

14:22.517 --> 14:25.322
It's just too bad I'm too
dumb to learn anything.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.348
You are not dumb.

14:27.570 --> 14:29.059
You just learn differently.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.970
If by "differently"
you mean "not at all"

14:31.988 --> 14:33.541
then you're totally right.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.115
No, that's totally wrong.

14:36.435 --> 14:37.996
See? Wrong again.

14:40.517 --> 14:43.463
I don't know anypony that's read
more Daring Do books than you.

14:43.789 --> 14:46.160
Well, that's not gonna get
me into the Wonderbolts.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.296
And your knowledge of
jokes and pranks

14:48.308 --> 14:49.705
is only rivaled by Pinkie.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.094
<i>Great, my years of being</i>
<i>a class clown</i>

14:53.139 --> 14:56.105
<i>prevented me from actually</i>
<i>learning how to learn.</i>

14:56.813 --> 14:58.124
That's not what I meant.

14:58.448 --> 15:00.899
You're smart, creative,
inventive, and...Ugh!

15:02.513 --> 15:04.905
Hey! I know you're upset,
but you don't need to--

15:08.887 --> 15:09.693
Whoa!

15:10.323 --> 15:11.808
I almost slammed into that.

15:12.170 --> 15:12.745
<i>I know!</i>

15:12.942 --> 15:15.254
You were jabbering on so
much, you didn't even notice.

15:15.601 --> 15:16.848
But how did you notice?

15:17.110 --> 15:19.588
You were listening and
talking to me the whole time.

15:19.832 --> 15:21.699
Ha ha! You're such a rookie.

15:22.015 --> 15:24.659
An experienced flyer like
me knows how to multi-task.

15:25.073 --> 15:26.347
While you fly?

15:26.686 --> 15:27.428
It's essential.

15:27.908 --> 15:29.416
Yes, I was paying
attention to you,

15:29.590 --> 15:32.524
but was also scanning the sky
and the ground for any problems.

15:32.934 --> 15:33.744
Really?

15:34.253 --> 15:35.884
Flying's not just flying.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.105
<i>In order to stay</i>
<i>safe in the sky,</i>

15:38.353 --> 15:40.013
<i>I've got to hear and</i>
<i>see everything</i>

15:40.027 --> 15:41.352
<i>down to the littlest detail.</i>

15:41.945 --> 15:44.827
For instance, I saw Apple Bloom,
<i>Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo</i>

15:44.940 --> 15:46.126
<i>come out of Sugar Cube Corner.</i>

15:46.536 --> 15:47.385
<i>And from the looks of it,</i>

15:47.488 --> 15:49.555
<i>they had carrot cupcakes</i>
<i>with sprinkles.</i>

15:50.446 --> 15:53.408
<i>And I'm thinking Big Mac</i>
<i>sold a huge order of apples</i>

15:53.414 --> 15:57.529
<i>to Filthy Rich because I heard</i>
<i>him give a very hearty, "Eeyup."</i>

15:59.607 --> 16:01.529
I always make note of
everything when I fly.

16:01.957 --> 16:02.620
No biggie.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.020
Oh my gosh!

16:05.198 --> 16:05.666
What?

16:05.974 --> 16:06.677
Gotta go!

16:07.814 --> 16:09.320
Yeah, I get it.

16:09.584 --> 16:12.686
I wouldn't want to hang out
with a loser like me either.

16:22.842 --> 16:24.388
Thanks for meeting
me, everypony.

16:24.536 --> 16:25.594
What is it, Twilight?

16:25.859 --> 16:27.371
We have to help Rainbow Dash.

16:28.952 --> 16:30.321
<i>Yes, but how?</i>

16:30.690 --> 16:32.745
We've tried every
kind of studying.

16:32.952 --> 16:34.768
My way, your way.

16:34.905 --> 16:37.104
But we haven't tried
Rainbow Dash's way.

16:37.434 --> 16:39.650
Hm, I'm intrigued.

16:41.198 --> 16:43.730
OK, listen up, ponies;
here's the plan.

16:49.738 --> 16:50.595
Hey, Rainbow.

16:51.096 --> 16:52.124
Wanna go for a fly?

16:52.876 --> 16:54.489
Sure.

16:54.591 --> 16:55.902
Got nothin' better to do.

16:59.588 --> 17:01.012
Didn't we just do this?

17:01.461 --> 17:03.832
Yes but, like you said,
I'm such a newbie,

17:03.840 --> 17:05.455
I need all the
practice I can get.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.901
Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll
become a great flier in no time.

17:11.217 --> 17:13.414
After all, you're
good at everything.

17:17.594 --> 17:19.888
So what's going on?

17:20.113 --> 17:21.092
Oh, nothing.

17:21.346 --> 17:23.090
Just getting my
dreams crushed.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.160
Uh,read any good books lately?

17:27.383 --> 17:28.749
Just history books.

17:29.254 --> 17:30.532
I'd tell you what
they're about,

17:30.589 --> 17:32.805
but my brain is
as dry as a rock.

17:33.824 --> 17:37.676
Speaking of rocks, did
you know Pinkie Pie

17:37.683 --> 17:39.170
grew up on a rock farm?

17:39.738 --> 17:42.602
Maybe I'll go work there,
since I have no other plans

17:42.844 --> 17:44.228
for the rest of my life.

17:44.696 --> 17:45.921
Oh, come on now, Rainbow.

17:46.142 --> 17:47.736
You can't give up on your dream.

17:48.130 --> 17:50.618
Seems my dream has
given up on me.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.770
Maybe I'll learn
to shine shoes.

17:53.024 --> 17:53.886
Sell hats.

17:54.152 --> 17:54.961
Dig ditches.

17:55.531 --> 17:57.490
Or maybe you'll be
a Wonderbolt.

17:58.109 --> 18:01.070
Twilight, give it
up! I have.

18:07.410 --> 18:09.959
So! What do you remember
about that flight?

18:10.425 --> 18:12.288
Nothing important.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.777
Except, after Luna was
banished to the moon,

18:15.783 --> 18:17.640
Celestia needed
protective forces,

18:17.654 --> 18:20.920
so Earth, Unicorn, and Pegasi
formed the E.U.P. Guard

18:20.932 --> 18:23.133
of the Protective
Pony Platoons.

18:24.558 --> 18:25.334
Yes?

18:25.758 --> 18:29.689
And at the celebration of the
first Celestial Year of Peace,

18:29.918 --> 18:31.736
an elite flying
squadron performed

18:31.953 --> 18:34.796
headed by General Firefly
who later named the group

18:34.915 --> 18:36.126
the Wonderbolts!

18:36.187 --> 18:36.915
Uh huh?

18:37.205 --> 18:39.808
Commander Easy Glider
established flight choreography

18:39.949 --> 18:42.078
that is still used by
the Wonderbolts today.

18:42.680 --> 18:43.506
Yes!

18:43.836 --> 18:45.920
I know the history.

18:46.290 --> 18:47.326
I know it all.

18:47.620 --> 18:50.253
But how in Equestria
did that happen?

18:50.643 --> 18:51.949
You learned it.

18:52.144 --> 18:54.645
Yeah, I got that, but how?

18:55.000 --> 18:58.023
Well, on our first flight, I
discovered that you catalogue

18:58.091 --> 19:00.163
everything that happens all
around you when you're flying

19:00.273 --> 19:01.839
without even thinking about it.

19:03.937 --> 19:04.872
Don't you see?

19:05.096 --> 19:07.633
I made use of your special
skills by enlisting everypony

19:07.640 --> 19:09.871
to help you learn the
History of the Wonderbolts.

19:11.818 --> 19:16.392
I, Princess Celestia, banish
you, Princess Luna to the moon.

19:16.899 --> 19:18.934
No!

19:23.404 --> 19:24.007
Earth!

19:24.464 --> 19:25.630
Unicorn!

19:25.945 --> 19:27.116
Pegasus!

19:27.611 --> 19:28.169
E!

19:28.643 --> 19:29.496
U!

19:29.709 --> 19:30.558
P!

19:31.149 --> 19:31.920
Eeyup.

19:32.282 --> 19:36.074
Let us celebrate our first
Celestial Year of Peace.

19:36.140 --> 19:38.747
Yeah. Let's party.
I'm General Firefly.

19:38.967 --> 19:41.207
Gee, my costume is
itchy and unattractive.

19:41.531 --> 19:43.695
But I'm gonna assemble
an awesome flying team.

19:45.170 --> 19:48.862
I'll call them the Wonderbolts.

19:48.991 --> 19:51.201
Streamlined style
by Flaire de Mare.

19:51.549 --> 19:52.911
Admiral Fair Weather.

19:53.432 --> 19:55.441
Colonel Purple Dart.

19:55.664 --> 19:58.144
Admiral Fairy Flight.

19:58.649 --> 19:59.670
General Flash.

20:00.150 --> 20:02.296
Commander Easy Glider.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.106
The History of the Wonderbolts.

20:20.331 --> 20:22.337
Oh my gosh, oh my
gosh, oh my gosh!

20:22.624 --> 20:23.555
Thank you!

20:23.652 --> 20:25.797
Thank you all so much!

20:25.972 --> 20:26.893
You're welcome.

20:26.991 --> 20:28.333
But it all came from you.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.462
You learn without
knowing you're learning.

20:31.549 --> 20:33.795
<i>Your main focus is flying,</i>
<i>but then your brain</i>

20:33.800 --> 20:36.189
<i>is also absorbing lots of</i>
<i>other information.</i>

20:36.481 --> 20:38.474
It's actually
really brilliant.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.851
Ha! I always knew
I was brilliant.

20:45.420 --> 20:48.189
<i>Rainbow Dash finally learned</i>
<i>the History of the Wonderbolts.</i>

20:48.489 --> 20:50.848
<i>But she's not the only</i>
<i>pony that needed a lesson.</i>

20:51.272 --> 20:53.763
<i>I needed to learn something</i>
<i>just as important.</i>

20:54.316 --> 20:56.495
<i>One way of learning isn't</i>
<i>better than another.</i>

20:56.880 --> 21:00.599
<i>After all, everypony is</i>
<i>unique and individual.</i>

21:28.433 --> 21:30.183
Ha ha! Whoo!
