WEBVTT

00:27.128 --> 00:27.893
Huh?

00:29.930 --> 00:33.932
[gasp] Some poor creature's in
trouble. We have to help it!

00:35.336 --> 00:40.373
Oooh! Listen to that suffering!
It must be in horrible agony!

00:48.516 --> 00:51.315
Oh! It sounds like a herd
of injured Chimerae.

00:55.056 --> 00:58.090
Or, it's Cerberus with
sniffle-itis in two of his heads

00:58.192 --> 01:00.826
and kennel cough in his
third, or maybe it's-

01:03.765 --> 01:05.031
Pinkie Pie..?

01:06.533 --> 01:11.604
That's me! And a one, and a
two, and a I know what to do--

01:15.077 --> 01:20.279
Ugh. At least no animal is
suffering, right Angel?

01:20.381 --> 01:24.417
[out of tune tuba and
bagpipe sounds]

01:24.519 --> 01:28.487
[nervous laugh]
Well, until now..

02:23.177 --> 02:24.776
What <i>is</i> that thing?

02:24.878 --> 02:27.012
It's called a Yovidophone.

02:27.114 --> 02:30.616
It's from Yakyakistan, where
it's actually quite popular.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.051
Is it supposed to
sound like that?

02:34.722 --> 02:36.622
Not exactly. It's
known to produce

02:36.724 --> 02:39.691
a fairly complicated
melodically rich and
harmonious tone.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.871
Are you sure we're talking
about the same thing?

02:56.827 --> 02:59.777
Phew! And that's with only
a few days of practice!

02:59.980 --> 03:01.647
Can you believe it!?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.518
Yes. Yes, I can.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.520
I can honestly say I've
never heard anything

03:08.622 --> 03:09.722
like it in my life.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.423
Well, if you enjoyed listening
to my playing half as much

03:12.526 --> 03:15.994
as I enjoyed playing my playing,
then I should totally play more.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.229
That way we'll be even!

03:17.431 --> 03:20.099
Oh, I don't think that's
necessary, Pinkie.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.702
Please. Don't.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.205
There's a chance I may
have missed a note or two

03:26.307 --> 03:29.609
here or there, but I just
love playing so much!

03:29.911 --> 03:32.578
[sigh] You.. complete me.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.080
Well, I for one am glad

03:35.182 --> 03:37.950
you're having so much
fun with your new hobby.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.020
Uh-huh, sure.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.490
And it's great that you're
learning a new skill and--

03:45.392 --> 03:47.192
and you're just waiting
for me to finish talking

03:47.294 --> 03:49.261
so you can start playing
again, aren't you?

03:49.663 --> 03:52.197
No! But if you're done...

03:52.399 --> 03:55.434
And-a one, and a two,
and-a I know what to do...

04:01.408 --> 04:04.143
Oh. It's OK, she's gone.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.145
Anypony else think that
sounded like an apple core

04:07.247 --> 04:08.747
caught up in a pulp grinder?

04:08.849 --> 04:11.283
Applesolutely..!
A-Absolutely.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.819
OK, so maybe she
isn't good yet,

04:13.921 --> 04:16.722
but she's our friend and
we should be supportive.

04:17.024 --> 04:21.359
She just started playing. She's
bound to get better. Right?

04:21.461 --> 04:24.530
Yeah, we just need to be
supportive of her practicing.

04:25.532 --> 04:29.000
So the getting better part
happens as fast as possible.

04:33.774 --> 04:34.273
Ah!

04:37.177 --> 04:37.876
Agh!

05:55.356 --> 05:57.989
Ah! You're absolutely
right, Spike.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.425
Sometimes it is nice to
get out of the library

06:00.527 --> 06:01.961
and be in the sun.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.230
Especially when you take
the library with you.

06:08.201 --> 06:12.003
[gasp] We need to do something about
Pinkie Pie's playing.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.472
Like <i>now</i>!

06:13.774 --> 06:15.307
Is it really that bad?

06:15.429 --> 06:17.762
Does <i>this</i> answer
your question?

06:17.844 --> 06:19.411
Uh, a trophy?

06:19.713 --> 06:25.316
For second place. SECOND. PLACE.
All because of Pinkie's playing.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.787
And I wanted to turn heads
with my new fall line,

06:29.089 --> 06:31.790
but not like this! [sobbing]

06:32.092 --> 06:34.626
And thanks to her fruit
blastin' melodies,

06:34.728 --> 06:37.162
I've got an orchard full of
nothing but apple sauce,

06:37.264 --> 06:39.331
and it ain't even
saucin' season!

06:39.633 --> 06:42.834
And just look what her playing
did to poor Fluttershy..

06:44.604 --> 06:48.339
Oh! So very tired. It
practically took me all night

06:48.441 --> 06:50.709
to get the nursery
back to sleep..

06:51.011 --> 06:53.745
I mean, I know we said we
should all be supportive,

06:53.847 --> 06:55.780
but Pinkie's been
playing for moons now

06:55.882 --> 06:57.449
and she's not
getting any better.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.719
Yeah, if anything,
she's gotten worse!

07:00.821 --> 07:03.688
OK, maybe we can just
pretend she's really good

07:03.790 --> 07:05.090
and then I'll find
a spell that will--

07:05.192 --> 07:08.360
Oh, no no no, we're not
going through that again!

07:08.462 --> 07:09.794
Remember how well
it worked out

07:09.896 --> 07:11.663
when you weren't
honest with Celestia

07:11.765 --> 07:13.532
about her acting ability?

07:13.634 --> 07:17.436
[groan] You're right. We'll just
have to tell Pinkie Pie

07:17.538 --> 07:20.071
she's not very good
at the Yovidophone.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.546
Well, there's no time
like the present.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.988
Phew! That's weird.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.791
I could have sworn this place
was packed a second ago.

07:40.293 --> 07:45.597
Hey guys! Can I favor you all
with a tune? I take requests!

07:45.799 --> 07:47.499
Actually, we do
have a request

07:47.601 --> 07:49.901
and yeah, it involves
your Yovidophone.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.472
You mean the thing I love more
than anything else in Equestria?

07:53.574 --> 07:57.776
My sun, my moon, my
stars! My everything?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.744
Oooh. Tell me! Tell
me! Tell me!

08:00.146 --> 08:02.413
All right, in all honesty...

08:03.784 --> 08:07.818
Uh... In all honesty,
Rarity has something to say.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.424
Pinkie, Please! Listen
to Rainbow Dash!

08:13.526 --> 08:16.828
Ugh. Fine. So Pinkie...

08:16.930 --> 08:18.963
remember when we all
were shocked to discover

08:19.065 --> 08:22.033
Princess Celestia wasn't
so good at acting?

08:22.135 --> 08:24.135
Yeah, she was awful!

08:24.437 --> 08:26.538
But that's kind of a
random thing to bring up.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.140
I thought you wanted to talk
about my Yovidophone playing.

08:29.642 --> 08:36.281
Well, it's ah, it's just... you
need to know the...Twilight?

08:36.583 --> 08:39.551
[sigh] Pinkie, we
all support you,

08:39.753 --> 08:42.353
but we're afraid you're just
not good at the Yovidophone

08:42.655 --> 08:44.355
and none of us want
you to waste your time

08:44.457 --> 08:46.258
on something you
can't do well.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.528
Oh. Why didn't you
just say so?

08:54.801 --> 08:58.269
Ah! We were all really
nervous to tell you.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.438
Why? It's just a
silly instrument.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.441
Well, lunch break's over,
gotta get back to the bakery.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.811
Those apple turn-overs aren't
gonna apple themselves!

09:08.815 --> 09:11.716
No more Yovidophone
playing for me!

09:12.770 --> 09:16.621
Wow. She took that so much
better than I thought!

09:29.703 --> 09:32.738
No more Yovidophone
playing for me...

09:33.440 --> 09:38.143
And a one, and a two, and
I don't know what to do...

09:50.991 --> 09:53.858
[sigh] Another beautiful
day in Ponyville.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.528
Uh, Twilight, when was the
last time you saw Pinkie Pie?

09:57.630 --> 10:00.865
Hmmm. Not since we told her to
stop playing the Yovidophone.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.268
I'm still surprised with
how well she took it.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.905
I don't think she took it as
well as you think she took it.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.141
Top of the
morning to ya!

10:10.543 --> 10:13.378
Is it morning? I
hadn't noticed.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.013
That's not good.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.014
Rainbow Dash: There you are!

10:16.116 --> 10:18.083
We've been looking
all over for you!

10:18.185 --> 10:21.052
It turns out Pinkie may not
have taken our critique

10:21.154 --> 10:22.153
of her Yovidophone playing

10:22.255 --> 10:24.222
in the spirit with
which it was intended.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.290
I saw.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.031
There's gotta be
something we can do.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.301
I'm sure there is, Spike. We
just have to figure out what.

10:36.403 --> 10:40.138
Ugh. I don't get it! So she's no
good at playing the Yovidophone.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.491
What's the big deal?

10:41.592 --> 10:44.843
There's soooo many other things
she's really good at doing!

10:44.945 --> 10:48.313
Yeah. Not being able to play
the Yovidophone is nothing

10:48.415 --> 10:50.849
compared to all the
things she can do well.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.551
And that's exactly
what we'll show her!

10:53.853 --> 10:55.954
I bet if we get her to
do the stuff she likes

10:56.056 --> 10:58.456
<i> and</i> is good at doing, she'll
cheer right back up

10:58.558 --> 11:00.725
and forget all about
the Yovidophone.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.494
Hoo whee! That's a
great idea!

11:06.833 --> 11:10.735
Let's get started. Apparently,
there's not a moment to lose!

12:21.308 --> 12:22.574
Achoo!

12:31.751 --> 12:35.053
So, I'm guessing
nopony had any success?

12:35.255 --> 12:39.157
Huh. My party cannon
idea was a real dud.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.961
Don't blame yourself.
None of us did any better.

12:43.363 --> 12:46.697
Well, not to worry. I came up
with the perfect solution.

12:46.799 --> 12:49.233
Instead of trying to remind
her what she's good at,

12:49.335 --> 12:53.037
we'll remind her what she's best
at. And that's being our friend!

12:53.139 --> 12:56.507
We're going to throw her a
Pinkie Pie appreciation party!

12:56.609 --> 12:58.576
That's a
wonderful idea!

12:58.678 --> 13:01.546
If anypony needs to know
how much she's appreciated,

13:01.648 --> 13:03.147
it's Pinkie Pie!

13:03.249 --> 13:04.849
We can get the
whole town involved,

13:05.051 --> 13:08.620
just so she can see what a good
friend she is to everypony!

13:08.822 --> 13:11.022
Then I hearby officially
declare today

13:11.124 --> 13:13.191
"Pinkie Pie
Appreciation Day!"

13:25.605 --> 13:27.939
Now <i>this</i> is perfection!

13:28.041 --> 13:30.408
Yeah, if anything can
help Pinkie cheer up

13:30.510 --> 13:32.343
and make her forget
about her Yovidophone,

13:32.445 --> 13:34.379
this is definitely it!

13:34.481 --> 13:37.248
It sure is. OK, who's
going to get her?

13:37.350 --> 13:40.951
No need. Gummy's on it.
In fact, there he is now!

13:47.460 --> 13:52.297
Uh, Gummy? You were supposed to
bring Pinkie Pie. What happened?

13:55.001 --> 13:56.200
Is she still coming!?

13:58.238 --> 14:00.805
Fluttershy, can you
understand what he's saying?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.742
I could... if he
was talking.

14:04.344 --> 14:09.981
Let me try something.
Gummy, where IS Pinkie Pie?

14:12.752 --> 14:14.853
Maybe we should
just go and get her.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.358
What in tarnation
is goin' on here?

14:20.560 --> 14:22.694
This decor is dreadful!

14:22.896 --> 14:25.564
And all of Pinkie's
stuff is... gone?

14:26.066 --> 14:27.298
It is a puzzle.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.399
Maud: Excuse me.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.900
Oh, yes of course.

14:36.442 --> 14:39.177
Um, Maud, can I
ask you a question?

14:39.279 --> 14:40.311
You just did.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.581
Well, can<i> I</i> ask
you a question?

14:43.083 --> 14:44.117
You just did.

14:44.218 --> 14:47.652
Agh! Fine! How about if
<i> I</i> ask you a-- wait.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.654
Oh, for goodness
sakes. Maud!

14:49.956 --> 14:52.523
All of your sister's
things are gone. Explain.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.625
No, they're not.
They're right here.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.297
Have you seen
Pinkie Pie?

15:00.833 --> 15:03.101
Lots of times. I
grew up with her.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.574
OK... let's try this
a different way.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.143
Why did you pack up
all of Pinkie's things?

15:12.245 --> 15:13.578
She asked me to.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.413
What!?

15:14.514 --> 15:15.747
Pinkie told me to
pack up her room

15:15.849 --> 15:17.782
and take everything
to the rock farm.

15:17.884 --> 15:18.716
WHAT!?

15:18.818 --> 15:19.851
She said she
wouldn't need them

15:19.953 --> 15:21.752
since she's moving
to Yakyakistan.

15:22.054 --> 15:22.920
WHAT!?!?

15:27.294 --> 15:29.994
Terribly sorry, Maud.
Must have misheard you.

15:30.096 --> 15:35.198
It almost sounded like you said
Pinkie's moved to Yakyakistan..
[chuckling]

15:35.302 --> 15:38.036
Uh, Rarity, she
<i> did</i> say that.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.906
Uh... terribly sorry,
Applejack; must have
misheard you.

15:42.008 --> 15:45.743
It almost sounded like
you said she did say that.

15:46.713 --> 15:50.681
Maud, I don't understand. Why
would Pinkie leave Ponyville?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.918
Yeah. Why would she wanna
go live with the Yaks?

15:54.320 --> 15:55.720
She said without
the Yovidophone,

15:55.822 --> 15:56.921
her life had
no meaning

15:57.023 --> 15:58.473
and at least
in Yakyakistan,

15:58.574 --> 16:00.324
she could listen to
the masters play.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.361
She hoped that would give her
some semblance of happiness.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.998
Well, no. Nononono!
That will not do.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.133
I say we go to
Yakyakistan right now

16:09.235 --> 16:10.535
and make her
come back home.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.504
We can't just march up there
and tell Pinkie what to do.

16:13.706 --> 16:17.308
But, we didn't even get
a chance to say goodbye.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.211
Well, we may not be able
to go to Yakyakistan

16:20.313 --> 16:24.249
and force her to come home,
but we could go say goodbye.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.652
And if we happen to mention how
much her friendship means to us,

16:27.854 --> 16:30.755
and how much we'd miss her
if she were gone forever,

16:30.857 --> 16:34.393
and then she decided to come
back home on her own...

16:35.195 --> 16:37.061
Then what are we waiting
around here for?

16:37.163 --> 16:39.964
Let's get going
to Yakyakistan!

16:48.775 --> 16:50.008
We're almost there.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.117
Pinkie's got to be
around here somewhere.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.551
But where?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.720
[Beautiful Yovidophone music]
Is that..?

17:02.822 --> 17:04.790
The music of the Yovidophone.

17:05.592 --> 17:10.028
Are you sure? Because that
actually sounds kinda good.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.862
Oh, I'm sure. Come on!

17:27.714 --> 17:30.348
Huh. Not what I expected.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.782
Shhhh!

17:31.884 --> 17:32.650
Oh, sorry.

17:32.752 --> 17:33.884
Shhh!

17:35.255 --> 17:37.556
Tch. I said I was sorry!

17:38.158 --> 17:39.757
Fluttershy: Ah! There she is!

17:43.263 --> 17:44.128
Gimme another.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.131
But pony already had
twenty-five ice--

17:47.233 --> 17:49.300
[bang] I said GIVE ME ANOTHER!

17:51.571 --> 17:52.136
Pardon me.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.104
Excuse us.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.238
Sorry!

17:55.875 --> 17:57.275
I feel nothing.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.943
Maybe we can
help with that.

18:01.347 --> 18:04.515
Oh. Hey. What are
you guys doing here?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.017
Just hear us out.

18:06.119 --> 18:09.020
We respect your decision
to move to Yakyakistan.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.889
But we just wanted to remind
you how much you mean to us,

18:12.091 --> 18:14.492
and how much we'd miss you if
you decided to move here for--

18:14.594 --> 18:16.861
Fine. I'll move
back to Ponyville.

18:17.063 --> 18:20.498
Wow. That was a lot easier
than I thought. We're awesome!

18:23.036 --> 18:24.869
Pinkie, what's wrong?

18:24.971 --> 18:26.571
That's what's wrong.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.506
I thought coming here and
listening to real

18:28.608 --> 18:30.775
Yovidophone playing
would make me happy.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.613
But it makes
me feel worse.

18:34.915 --> 18:37.482
I'm never going to
sound like them.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.885
Yovidophone Fan-pony
watch instrument

18:40.987 --> 18:44.022
while Yigrid visit
little Yak's room?

18:44.124 --> 18:47.291
Eh, if I can't play it, I
might as well do menial chores

18:47.393 --> 18:48.993
for those who can.

18:49.896 --> 18:53.197
OK, so Pinkie Pie is
obviously still miserable.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.300
Oh. I can't bear to
see her like this.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.104
Indeed. But what
else can we do?

19:00.506 --> 19:02.673
Yeah, we've tried everything!

19:02.775 --> 19:04.876
Maybe not! Look!

19:06.946 --> 19:08.013
Hee hee!

19:08.115 --> 19:13.785
Whoops! Sorry. I forgot what
an awful Yovidophoner I am.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.287
Playing it makes you so happy!

19:16.389 --> 19:20.825
[sigh] It sure does.
I mean it did.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.094
Then you should never stop!

19:23.396 --> 19:24.495
So say we all!

19:24.697 --> 19:25.964
Absolutely!

19:26.166 --> 19:28.232
But you were the ones
who told me to stop

19:28.334 --> 19:29.800
because I wasn't good.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.135
And we were wrong.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.937
Playing makes
you happy.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.705
And as long as it
makes you happy,

19:34.807 --> 19:36.707
it doesn't matter
how good you are.

19:36.809 --> 19:40.311
So get up there and show
these yaks how it's done!

19:40.613 --> 19:42.780
[loud whisper] I don't
know if you've noticed,

19:42.882 --> 19:47.051
but the audience are all yaks
and they kinda have "issues"

19:47.153 --> 19:49.387
with things
that aren't perfect...

19:49.489 --> 19:51.589
like my playing.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.525
Pinkie Pie, you get up
on that stage and play.

19:54.627 --> 19:58.396
If these Yaks don't like it,
they'll have to answer to us!

19:59.298 --> 20:03.267
Well, OK. If you all say so...

20:03.669 --> 20:06.304
Ahem. Ladies and gentle yaks!

20:06.406 --> 20:08.839
Performing for her
very first time here,

20:08.941 --> 20:14.045
let's give a big round
of stomps for... Pinkie Pie!

20:14.147 --> 20:20.652
Ahem. Um, hi. So er.. any yaks
here from out of town?

20:22.722 --> 20:28.259
OK. And a one, and a two and a
uh, kinda remember what to do...

20:49.549 --> 20:53.151
Uh, I kinda wasn't
expecting this.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.385
Me neither.

20:55.522 --> 20:58.423
Oh! Pony play good set.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.459
You think so? Even
though it wasn't perfect?

21:01.561 --> 21:04.829
Yovidophone is
instrument of happiness.

21:04.931 --> 21:10.935
Playing Yovidophone make pony
happy. Pony playing IS perfect!

21:11.137 --> 21:13.371
Well, if that's the
case, let me play you

21:13.473 --> 21:15.139
the song I just wrote
two seconds ago!

21:15.241 --> 21:18.176
It's called: "I've Got the
Best, Most Supportive Friends

21:18.278 --> 21:20.645
a Pony Could Ever
Ask For."

21:21.147 --> 21:22.413
It's a working title.

21:22.915 --> 21:23.714
And a one-

21:23.816 --> 21:24.582
And a two-

21:24.784 --> 21:26.617
And a you know what to do-
