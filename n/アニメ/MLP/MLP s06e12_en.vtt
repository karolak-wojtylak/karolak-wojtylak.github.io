00:02.900 --> 00:04.350
<i> As you've</i>
<i> all probably noticed,</i>

00:04.400 --> 00:06.825
it's been quite some time
since the map has sent us

00:06.850 --> 00:08.100
on a mission of friendship.

00:08.375 --> 00:10.400
Yeah, ever since
Starlight messed with it

00:10.425 --> 00:12.450
to go back in time and
tried to change history.

00:13.025 --> 00:16.140
Yes. Since then. But
as part of her studies,

00:16.150 --> 00:17.875
Starlight's been
assisting me

00:18.052 --> 00:20.152
and together we think
we've come up with a spell

00:20.200 --> 00:21.650
that will get it
working again.

00:21.925 --> 00:23.850
Woo-hoo! Oooh!
Well done!

00:25.725 --> 00:27.400
Now, without further ado...

00:37.570 --> 00:39.825
Oooh!

00:40.425 --> 00:42.125
Fluttershy and
Twilight in Appleoosa!

00:42.340 --> 00:44.375
NO! Me and Rainbow
Dash in Las Pegasus!

00:44.578 --> 00:46.745
NO! Rainbow Dash and
Twilight in Yakyakistan!

00:46.925 --> 00:49.225
NO! TWILIGHT AND TWILIGHT IN
TWILIGHT'S CASTLE!?

00:49.850 --> 00:51.775
ME! ME! OH! ME!

00:51.900 --> 00:55.500
AND RARITY! Oooooh I hope
it's some faraway place

00:55.525 --> 00:57.825
that nopony has
gone before!

00:57.975 --> 01:01.600
Well.
Maybe not TOO far away.

01:01.825 --> 01:04.350
An adventure somewhere that
has modern conveniences

01:04.400 --> 01:05.400
would be preferable.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.401
CANTERLOT!
This is wonderful!

01:09.625 --> 01:10.575
I can check the boutique!

01:10.750 --> 01:11.950
Perhaps there will
be some social events

01:11.950 --> 01:12.600
that we can attend!

01:12.650 --> 01:14.300
I'll have to
pack extra outfits!

01:14.725 --> 01:16.800
What will I wear!

01:17.550 --> 01:19.550
You know, some
ponies get excited

01:19.625 --> 01:21.450
about the
silliest things.

01:28.550 --> 01:39.125
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies
We have muffins!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

02:04.675 --> 02:08.075
Now then. As far as
finding a friendship problem,

02:08.300 --> 02:10.050
I suggest we start
at the castle

02:10.290 --> 02:11.625
and begin to
question the proper--

02:11.650 --> 02:14.275
Oh, Rarity, you don't
find a friendship problem.

02:14.375 --> 02:17.475
It finds you! We just
need to go with the flow

02:17.500 --> 02:19.800
and eventually KABLAM! We
get friendship problem'd

02:19.900 --> 02:21.275
right between
the eyes!

02:21.509 --> 02:23.742
Well, this is a
team effort

02:23.825 --> 02:25.750
so if you feel we
should go with the flow,

02:25.950 --> 02:27.725
then with the flow
we shall go!

02:28.700 --> 02:31.025
Where is the flow
saying we should go?

02:31.410 --> 02:33.900
You know Canterlot! What
do you think we should do?

02:34.225 --> 02:37.420
Oh! Take your pick!
Culture, couture, cuisine!

02:41.390 --> 02:43.625
Oh my. Well, it sounds
like your stomach

02:43.675 --> 02:46.100
is saying we should
flow towards some lunch?

02:46.275 --> 02:47.875
I know JUST where to go!

02:49.435 --> 02:50.936
Restaurant Row!

02:50.975 --> 02:53.170
The absolute best
place for fine dining

02:53.225 --> 02:54.475
in all of Equestria.

02:55.025 --> 02:57.270
Ooooooh, so many choices!

02:57.300 --> 03:00.075
Where should we go? This
one? That one? Those ones?

03:00.350 --> 03:02.475
Any establishments
that have this.

03:02.925 --> 03:04.625
The three-hoof rating.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.525
Um... whose hooves?

03:06.900 --> 03:10.050
Why, Zesty Gourmand,
the queen of cuisine.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.875
When it comes to food, she
is the ultimate authority

03:12.900 --> 03:14.825
in Canterlot and
thus all Equestria!

03:15.075 --> 03:17.525
She judges a restaurant
on cuisine, décor

03:17.550 --> 03:19.875
and presentation.
Without her approval,

03:19.900 --> 03:21.925
a restaurant simply
cannot survive.

03:22.175 --> 03:24.275
What's so important
about her approval?

03:24.675 --> 03:26.575
Zesty grew up around
fine dining

03:26.850 --> 03:29.775
and everypony hangs
on her every word

03:29.800 --> 03:31.050
when it comes
to cuisine.

03:31.375 --> 03:34.610
WOW. Then the food
here must be AMAZING!

03:34.725 --> 03:38.425
Lead the way, partner!
Wheeeeee!

03:41.800 --> 03:45.590
Oh my. Such
presentation!

03:48.000 --> 03:54.125
Oh.
Ah, yes. Very nice.

03:57.500 --> 04:01.725
Ugh. Maybe I'm not in the
mood for... whatever this is.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.675
Can we try someplace else?

04:04.325 --> 04:08.580
Ugh. Maybe
one more stop?

04:10.175 --> 04:11.650
Nope.

04:12.925 --> 04:15.950
Maybe instead of trusting
somepony else's hooves,

04:16.075 --> 04:17.650
I should pick
the next place?

04:18.075 --> 04:20.025
Ugh! Very well.

04:32.100 --> 04:36.825
The Tasty Treat.
It's very... rustic.

04:37.325 --> 04:40.100
It looks like it
hasn't even been rated!

04:40.850 --> 04:43.150
Thank goodness!

04:53.500 --> 04:54.850
Are we sure
they're open?

04:55.100 --> 04:58.650
Mmmm! It
smells open!

05:00.800 --> 05:02.960
Oh! Are you here for lunch?

05:03.275 --> 05:04.500
Yes indeedy!

05:04.730 --> 05:08.450
I'm Saffron Masala, the chef
here at the Tasty Treat!

05:08.650 --> 05:11.125
The most exotic
cuisine in Canterlot.

05:11.510 --> 05:13.375
Would you like to hear
about the specials?

05:13.620 --> 05:14.825
We're actually in
a bit of a hu--

05:14.850 --> 05:15.525
YES, PLEASE!

05:15.900 --> 05:18.500
We have a curried oatcake--

05:18.800 --> 05:19.550
We'll take one!

05:20.175 --> 05:23.050
And a grass sandwich that
has been marinated overnight

05:23.150 --> 05:25.125
in a mustard
Dijon dressing.

05:25.350 --> 05:27.050
How can we say
no to that?

05:27.350 --> 05:28.400
A-And for you?

05:28.550 --> 05:30.675
Oh! Me? Oh, I'm
fine. Thank you.

05:31.730 --> 05:33.825
No rating.

05:34.730 --> 05:38.000
Anyway they won't come.

05:38.075 --> 05:39.770
Hiya! What's your name?

05:40.025 --> 05:41.225
Coriander Cumin.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.008
Are you a chef here, too?

05:43.075 --> 05:45.325
My daughter cooks. I host.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.425
Then why are you
stacking chairs?

05:47.550 --> 05:52.550
Without customers, I have no
pony to host for. So, I stack.

05:53.050 --> 05:54.400
Father! STOP IT!

05:54.575 --> 05:57.325
Don't close up the restaurant
around our guests!

05:57.491 --> 05:59.558
What does it matter?
When they leave,

05:59.725 --> 06:01.875
nopony else will
be coming in!

06:02.120 --> 06:05.600
Well, your attitude isn't
going to bring anyone in!

06:05.760 --> 06:08.550
Can't you at least
pretend to be positive?

06:08.750 --> 06:13.225
Sooooooo
goooooood!

06:13.300 --> 06:16.050
You are doing enough
pretending for the both of us.

06:16.350 --> 06:19.975
Nopony here wants
to try anything new.

06:20.110 --> 06:22.300
I know when to
throw in the towel!

06:22.780 --> 06:25.600
Um. Pinkie, perhaps we
should excuse ourselves.

06:25.810 --> 06:29.225
Oh Rarity,
try this!

06:29.625 --> 06:32.200
Oooh!

06:32.625 --> 06:35.675
Maybe if you would listen
to my ideas for once--

06:36.000 --> 06:39.700
Oh yes, I did not move
halfway across Equestria

06:39.775 --> 06:42.450
for my daughter that
I NEVER listen to!

06:43.125 --> 06:45.050
Rarity. I think that
friendship problem

06:45.125 --> 06:46.950
just KABLAMMED us
right between the eyes.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.825
These two? Oh I
don't know, darling.

06:51.075 --> 06:54.100
The food IS excellent, but
I'm not sure there's much

06:54.150 --> 06:56.125
you and I can do
to help them.

06:56.580 --> 06:57.875
What would you
have me do?

06:57.950 --> 06:59.600
We can't even get
Zesty Gourmand

06:59.650 --> 07:00.825
to come to our
restaurant!

07:01.020 --> 07:02.925
She took one look
at how empty it was

07:03.023 --> 07:05.056
and said it wasn't
even worth rating!

07:05.225 --> 07:06.150
THAT'S IT!

07:06.550 --> 07:09.475
YES! Uh, what's it?

07:09.800 --> 07:12.925
The flow HAS led us here!
THIS is our mission!

07:13.100 --> 07:15.325
We are going to get
you a Three Hoof rating

07:15.375 --> 07:19.650
and save your restaurant! I
can get Zesty Gourmand here.

07:19.825 --> 07:22.575
And I can pack
this place with ponies!

07:22.870 --> 07:25.725
Hmph! And how do you
intend to do such a thing?

07:25.925 --> 07:27.425
Just leave it to us!

07:35.475 --> 07:38.690
Father, will you PLEASE
stop packing things?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.900
When the lovely
pony comes back

07:41.000 --> 07:43.700
and says she couldn't
convince Zesty Gourmand

07:43.750 --> 07:46.575
to come visit us, we will
need to pack all this up.

07:46.725 --> 07:48.500
I'm just getting
a head start.

07:48.775 --> 07:50.400
You really don't
know Rarity.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.675
I've done it!

07:53.550 --> 07:54.530
See?

07:54.750 --> 07:56.750
It took all of my
charm and cajoling,

07:56.900 --> 07:59.400
but I was able to
convince Zesty Gourmand

07:59.450 --> 08:00.725
to come and try the food!

08:00.950 --> 08:02.525
What is the catch?

08:02.925 --> 08:07.400
Ah, yes. Well, um, there
IS a bit of a challenge.

08:07.550 --> 08:10.875
The only time she can make
herself available is tonight.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.900
Pfft! Oh yeah, right.

08:13.100 --> 08:13.900
What is it?

08:14.050 --> 08:16.500
Zesty rates a restaurant
on cuisine, decor

08:16.600 --> 08:20.350
AND presentation. And she
has very specific tastes.

08:20.575 --> 08:23.050
If she's coming tonight,
there IS quite a bit of work

08:23.125 --> 08:24.275
that needs to get done.

08:24.425 --> 08:25.200
Like what?

08:25.525 --> 08:27.150
Oh a tweak here, a tuck there.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.740
Some slight modifications
to the menu.

08:29.875 --> 08:32.875
We just need the place to
feel more cosmopolitan.

08:33.775 --> 08:36.950
Father, after Rarity went to
all of this trouble for us,

08:37.225 --> 08:39.425
can't we at least try?

08:39.750 --> 08:41.675
Why don't I stay
behind with Coriander

08:41.725 --> 08:43.675
to get the restaurant
ready for Zesty's arrival.

08:43.975 --> 08:46.500
You and Saffron can try
and drum up some business.

08:46.675 --> 08:49.050
One packed restaurant
coming right up.

08:50.425 --> 08:53.450
Coriander, I understand
your trepidation.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.250
But I promise you, we will
get those hooves by making

08:56.325 --> 08:58.650
this place feel just like
all of the other restaurants

08:58.700 --> 09:00.225
on Restaurant Row!

09:00.925 --> 09:04.125
I hope my father
doesn't drive Rarity crazy.

09:04.325 --> 09:06.775
It'll be fine. Rarity's
going to make sure that

09:06.825 --> 09:09.025
The Tasty Treat is the
most unique and beautiful

09:09.050 --> 09:10.475
restaurant in Canterlot!

09:10.625 --> 09:13.675
Not like all those stuffy
places on Restaurant Row!

11:49.550 --> 11:52.750
Check out the super stupendous
and amazing cuisine

11:52.800 --> 11:56.975
of the Tasty Treat! GRAND
RE-OPENING TONIGHT!

11:57.550 --> 11:59.150
How many Hooves
does it have?

11:59.350 --> 12:01.950
No hooves yet, but
hopefully soon!

12:02.800 --> 12:05.500
Well, when it gets
rated, let us know!

12:05.775 --> 12:08.100
Ughh! Stupid hooves!

12:11.125 --> 12:12.775
Oh, look at this, hon!

12:12.875 --> 12:14.325
Oh, The Tasty Treat.

12:14.475 --> 12:16.250
Do you think that's
a restaurant, Sugar?

12:16.350 --> 12:17.525
Yes! Yes it IS!

12:17.650 --> 12:19.800
We came to Canterlot
from Winnieapolis

12:19.850 --> 12:21.000
to be adventurous!

12:21.275 --> 12:24.925
But so far the food in all
these hoity- toity places

12:24.950 --> 12:28.750
tastes like somepony cooked up
nuthin' with a side of nuthin!

12:29.025 --> 12:31.750
Well, please, come
try The Tasty Treat.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.975
I think it's going
to be exactly

12:34.000 --> 12:35.275
what you're
looking for!

12:40.100 --> 12:42.650
This is
going to be exactly

12:42.700 --> 12:44.200
what Zesty is looking for!

12:45.725 --> 12:48.150
Father, we're ba--

12:48.300 --> 12:50.775
Rarity. What did
you do?

12:51.525 --> 12:53.250
Welcome to The Tasty Treat.

12:53.350 --> 12:56.425
You can eat here if you
want. Or not. Who cares?

12:57.000 --> 13:00.525
I know! Isn't it perfect?
Zesty is sure to love it!

13:00.750 --> 13:03.075
I thought we were trying to
make this the most unique

13:03.100 --> 13:04.925
and beautiful
restaurant in Canterlot.

13:05.050 --> 13:08.150
Not make it exactly like
every other restaurant!

13:08.400 --> 13:10.225
We want
to help our friends

13:10.250 --> 13:13.075
by getting them three hooves.
That will only happen

13:13.100 --> 13:14.775
if this IS like every
other restaurant.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.025
Father, what is this?

13:19.675 --> 13:22.850
NOT THAT! ANYTHING BUT THAT!

13:23.375 --> 13:27.025
This is what we must cook
if we want to succeed here!

13:27.175 --> 13:29.325
This isn't what I wanted!

13:29.475 --> 13:32.600
I wanted Canterlot
to like US for US!

13:33.200 --> 13:35.700
Rarity, how could you
ruin the restaurant!

13:35.825 --> 13:38.975
Ah! We've
helped SAVE the restaurant!

13:39.150 --> 13:41.275
Now where are the
other guests?

13:41.450 --> 13:43.150
How many other
ponies are coming?

13:44.200 --> 13:45.000
Two.

13:45.325 --> 13:49.000
Just TWO? I thought you
said you could pack a place

13:49.050 --> 13:50.650
with ponies no matter what!

13:50.750 --> 13:52.625
YOU said you would make
the restaurant better

13:52.675 --> 13:55.300
so I guess we both didn't know
what we were talking about!

13:56.330 --> 13:59.600
ZESTY GOURMAND!
Everypony! Places!

14:14.100 --> 14:16.625
Welcome to the Tasty Treat.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.090
What can I get you
this evening?

14:19.450 --> 14:21.150
I hardly think it matters.

14:21.225 --> 14:24.775
But by all means, try
your best to impress.

14:25.025 --> 14:27.300
Well, we'll both try the
special this evening,

14:27.425 --> 14:29.125
maybe with a little
kick to it, eh?

14:29.325 --> 14:31.725
Yeah, we've been craving
some food with actual taste.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.025
Saffron Masala!
What are you doing?

14:38.350 --> 14:41.225
I'm trying to save
our reputations.

14:42.550 --> 14:45.425
I've given it at least
a little bit of flavor.

14:45.575 --> 14:47.625
No, no, no, no! But that's
not what Zesty wants!

14:48.000 --> 14:50.725
What kind of food expert
DOESN'T want flavor?

14:50.850 --> 14:52.425
That's insane!

14:55.875 --> 14:57.325
I'm taking this out there.

14:57.425 --> 14:59.275
No! Zesty will hate it!

15:00.225 --> 15:02.050
You are going to
RUIN this for them!

15:02.350 --> 15:05.550
No! I'm trying to fix
it after YOU ruined it!

15:07.625 --> 15:09.725
Nooooooooooo!

15:13.875 --> 15:16.000
I think we are done here.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.910
Zesty! Please wait.
Allow me to explain.

15:21.150 --> 15:24.775
Rarity. When it comes to
fashion, you are adequate.

15:24.950 --> 15:27.050
But take some advice
from a friend.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.825
Keep your opinions
out of restaurants.

15:29.925 --> 15:34.150
Substandard food, laughable
service and I would think

15:34.200 --> 15:36.975
even YOU could recognize
that the decor here

15:37.025 --> 15:40.975
is trying desperately
while desperately failing.

15:41.275 --> 15:44.175
Recommending a disreputable
place such as this

15:44.450 --> 15:48.075
could do serious damage
to your social standing.

15:48.300 --> 15:49.400
Disreputable?

15:49.525 --> 15:52.500
You mean a place with food
that actually tastes good?

15:52.700 --> 15:55.925
Anypony can throw
ingredients together

15:55.950 --> 16:00.125
and create an obvious taste
that uncultured ponies

16:00.175 --> 16:02.375
like those two can register.

16:02.525 --> 16:03.460
Hey!

16:03.700 --> 16:06.425
But it takes a TRUE
culinary artist

16:06.600 --> 16:08.675
to create a subtle taste.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.750
The barest hint
of a sensation.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.900
That's what I bring to
Canterlot. That's art.

16:20.775 --> 16:23.140
I'm so embarrassed.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.800
I don't know that there are
words to adequately express

16:25.850 --> 16:27.875
how truly sorry we are.

16:28.100 --> 16:32.600
The worst has happened. No use
crying over spilled food now.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.325
Here, this always cheered
me up when I was younger.

16:36.570 --> 16:41.975
My spicy flat
noodle soup!

16:42.275 --> 16:45.950
Mmm! Oh my, this is
truly delightful.

16:46.050 --> 16:48.900
This is the best thing
you've made so far.

16:49.025 --> 16:51.075
And I thought the food
before was the best!

16:51.250 --> 16:54.425
That's all I've ever
wanted to do, Father.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.700
Make food for the
ponies of Canterlot

16:56.750 --> 16:59.950
like the food we made
together when I was younger.

17:00.150 --> 17:03.750
It has been so long since
we've cooked together.

17:03.950 --> 17:06.175
Remember how you used
to hide the ingredients

17:06.225 --> 17:07.275
you did not like.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.320
You know what?

17:11.600 --> 17:13.625
Who cares what
some stuffy unicorn

17:13.675 --> 17:16.160
thinks of the food
here. It's exquisite.

17:16.525 --> 17:17.550
That's true.

17:18.225 --> 17:20.350
And you don't need three
silly hooves in your window

17:20.425 --> 17:21.300
to prove it.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.240
That's double true!

17:23.425 --> 17:26.475
You just need ponies in
here to give it a chance.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.180
Ponies that will tell
everypony else in Canterlot

17:29.300 --> 17:31.850
that the Tasty Treat is
the best food in the city!

17:32.125 --> 17:34.280
THAT'S TRUE TIMES THREE!

17:34.450 --> 17:38.625
But without Zesty's approval,
nopony will even try our food.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.220
Oohoho, yes they will.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.200
Pinkie! We ARE the
perfect team for this;

17:44.300 --> 17:46.150
we were just doing
the wrong jobs.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.000
I will go out and
bring the crowd.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.400
You stay here and make sure
this place is every bit

17:51.475 --> 17:54.750
as unique and rustic as it
was the moment we walked in.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.550
And what about us?

17:56.800 --> 18:00.850
You two? You are going to
cook. Make whatever you want.

18:00.950 --> 18:04.075
And make a lot of it. I
intend to bring a crowd!

18:06.550 --> 18:10.275
Would the owner of one of the
premier boutiques in Canterlot

18:10.350 --> 18:12.400
put her stamp of
approval on something

18:12.450 --> 18:14.425
that wasn't fabulous?

18:36.125 --> 18:37.175
It's almost time.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.650
Is everypony ready for
the grand re-re-opening?

18:39.875 --> 18:44.250
Before we open, my father and
I just wanted to say thank you

18:44.300 --> 18:45.325
for all of your help.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.000
We've both been so stressed
about the restaurant

18:48.075 --> 18:51.000
succeeding that we forgot
what it was we loved about it

18:51.050 --> 18:52.175
in the first place.

18:52.300 --> 18:55.025
Cooking is something we
used to love to do together.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.850
No matter what happens next,

18:57.125 --> 18:59.375
thank you for
reminding us of that.

18:59.650 --> 19:02.825
Oh you guys! GROUP HUG!

19:05.175 --> 19:08.650
Now come on! We've
got a party to throw!

19:10.540 --> 19:14.075
Oooh! Wow! It
smells really good!

19:14.150 --> 19:18.950
Welcome to the Tasty Treat!
Make yourselves comfortable!

19:24.800 --> 19:27.760
Please, feel free
to sample the food!

19:28.275 --> 19:29.660
What's this?

19:29.825 --> 19:34.270
What is everypony doing here?
This place has no hooves.

19:34.450 --> 19:37.050
It is not in keeping
with the level of cuisine

19:37.100 --> 19:39.550
that I have set
for Canterlot.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.825
Nopony told you this
place was acceptable.

19:43.050 --> 19:46.650
Uh, Rarity and her friend said
it was good. They told us.

19:46.875 --> 19:51.420
They told you? And who are
they to tell you anything?

19:51.650 --> 19:55.025
Rarity can tell you what hats
to wear with which skirts.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.250
Her friend can tell you how
to maintain a tragic look

19:58.325 --> 19:59.575
for a frizzy mane.

19:59.750 --> 20:02.875
They can't tell you
what food you can eat.

20:03.150 --> 20:05.750
No, we can't. And
neither can you.

20:06.075 --> 20:08.600
Nopony has the right to tell
these ponies what to think.

20:08.950 --> 20:11.450
Zesty, you have very specific--

20:11.525 --> 20:12.800
And very strange!

20:12.900 --> 20:15.425
Yes and very strange
opinions about food.

20:15.575 --> 20:16.925
And that's your right.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.450
But just because you like
your food a certain way,

20:19.575 --> 20:21.375
there is no reason
to tell these ponies

20:21.400 --> 20:22.550
that they need to
do the same.

20:22.875 --> 20:24.225
Rarity is right!

20:24.325 --> 20:26.975
I for one think the
food here is delicious.

20:27.175 --> 20:30.050
I own the Smoked Oat
on Restaurant Row!

20:30.125 --> 20:32.000
I hate the food we make!

20:32.250 --> 20:36.700
From now on, it's all
smoked, basted and grilled!

20:36.900 --> 20:41.325
This food is an inspiration!
I own the Bake Shop!

20:41.500 --> 20:43.450
I'm going to bake my
mother's Bundt cake

20:43.500 --> 20:46.500
the way she made
it! Full of flavor!

20:46.575 --> 20:49.880
Yes! Yeah!

20:50.150 --> 20:52.780
Zesty, are you sure you
wouldn't like to try the food?

20:52.950 --> 20:55.625
Ignoring a unique and fresh
establishment such as this

20:55.650 --> 20:58.700
could do serious damage
to your social standing.

21:09.450 --> 21:10.725
Thank you so much!

21:11.200 --> 21:13.975
You are both truly amazing.

21:18.750 --> 21:23.175
Nothing can stop the dynamic
duo of Pinkie and Rarity!
