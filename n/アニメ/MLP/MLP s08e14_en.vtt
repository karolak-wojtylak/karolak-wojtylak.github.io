WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:06.772
Who can tell me what these are?

00:06.874 --> 00:08.907
[Various] Treasure?
Shiny! Me likey. Whoa.

00:09.109 --> 00:09.875
Nope!

00:09.977 --> 00:12.412
They're all legendary
magical artifacts!

00:13.614 --> 00:17.349
Heh.  I read ahead in Equestrian
Cultures and Camaraderie.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.385
Volume seven.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.986
You're right, Ocellus!

00:21.088 --> 00:24.923
This is the Amulet of Aurora,
the Talisman of Mirage,

00:25.025 --> 00:28.127
the Helm of Yksler,
the Crown of Grover,

00:28.329 --> 00:31.797
Knuckerbocker's Shell and
Clover the Clever's Cloak.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.332
And the gems are real!

00:34.368 --> 00:36.503
Er.. not that I tasted them..

00:37.705 --> 00:40.071
Princess Celestia gifted
these to our school,

00:40.173 --> 00:42.107
since they each represent
one of the cultures

00:42.209 --> 00:43.475
our students come from.

00:43.877 --> 00:47.846
And we'll learn all about them
with a Spell-venger hunt!

00:50.351 --> 00:52.752
Is that a pony thing?

00:52.953 --> 00:53.429
Meh.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.121
It's a magical
scavenger hunt!

00:55.623 --> 00:57.422
Each of you will work
in pairs to try to find

00:57.524 --> 00:59.192
where in the school these
artifacts are hidden.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.227
The team that finds the most
wins a private tour

01:02.329 --> 01:04.729
of the Canterlot archives
with Princess Celestia.

01:04.931 --> 01:05.631
Mm-hm!

01:05.933 --> 01:09.100
Oooh! Learning AND fun?

01:09.202 --> 01:11.537
Does it get any
better than that!?

01:12.239 --> 01:15.841
You've been underwater a
<i>long</i> time, haven't you?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.376
Twilight: Gallus and Silverstream?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.345
Sounds like you're
our first pair.

01:20.865 --> 01:22.582
What? They'll make
a great team!

01:23.684 --> 01:25.784
Um. Why pony glowing?

01:34.027 --> 01:37.229
Wait, you all were called on
this friendship quest, too?

01:37.431 --> 01:40.399
It must be a <i>really</i>
important one.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.768
And terribly
far away.

01:44.972 --> 01:48.140
Ugh. Just getting there
will take DAYS!

01:48.242 --> 01:49.775
Do y'all know
what this means?

01:50.077 --> 01:52.978
There won't be any teachers
left to run the school!

02:33.654 --> 02:35.921
Should we send
our students home?

02:36.023 --> 02:37.589
I say we take
'em with us!

02:37.691 --> 02:38.790
ROAD TRIP!

02:38.892 --> 02:41.593
In the middle of my
friendship quilting class?

02:41.695 --> 02:42.994
I think not!

02:43.096 --> 02:44.963
All of those
unfinished seams....

02:47.366 --> 02:50.702
Problem is, we don't even
know how long we'll be gone!

02:50.804 --> 02:51.870
Twilight: Don't worry, everypony.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.739
I already have a
seventy-point plan in place

02:53.841 --> 02:55.174
for this very situation.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.445
You want ME to be Headmare?

03:00.647 --> 03:01.913
You're the
perfect choice.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.450
You're a good leader,
and an expert in
friendship!

03:05.152 --> 03:08.153
I trust you to run this
school exactly as I would.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.456
Uh, that's a pretty big
responsibility, Twilight...

03:12.726 --> 03:15.260
Which is why I've prepared
everything you need!

03:20.951 --> 03:23.401
The curriculum, rules
for the Spellvenger hunt,

03:23.504 --> 03:25.737
dining hall menus for
the next six months.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.040
Six months!?

03:28.742 --> 03:31.009
You're not really gonna be
gone that long, are you?

03:31.111 --> 03:32.078
And Spike.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.746
Anything that isn't
covered in my files,

03:34.848 --> 03:36.148
he'll be able to
help you with.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.483
Then why not put
him in charge?

03:38.585 --> 03:40.452
No-o-o, thanks.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.222
Being a princess for
Twilight was hard enough.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.491
I'm gonna pretend
that made sense.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.828
But if you're sure it's
what you really want...

03:49.230 --> 03:51.096
I promise I won't let you down.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.265
I knew I could count on you.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.134
[rustling]
Gah!

03:56.737 --> 03:57.587
Great.....

03:57.688 --> 03:59.538
What could possibly go wrong?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.644
Good-bye, Rarity!

04:06.346 --> 04:07.612
And everypony!

04:07.714 --> 04:08.913
Come back soon!

04:09.015 --> 04:09.815
Please.

04:12.352 --> 04:13.285
Huh?

04:13.387 --> 04:15.954
I hate goodbyes, don't you?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.856
I just go to pieces!

04:19.660 --> 04:20.492
Discord!

04:20.694 --> 04:21.593
What a...

04:22.195 --> 04:23.296
nice surprise!

04:24.498 --> 04:26.865
This is your first time at
our new school, isn't it?

04:27.067 --> 04:29.901
Oh, was I not invited
to the grand opening?

04:30.003 --> 04:32.037
Friends and Family Day?
Baccalaureate?

04:32.139 --> 04:33.972
All: I hadn't noticed.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.443
Well, at least you're here now!

04:38.245 --> 04:40.479
Um, why ARE you here now?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.181
To fill in for
Twilight, of course.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.016
As Headdraconequus.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.386
I seem to recall a whole song
about how this school

04:47.488 --> 04:49.288
is where you make
your own rules.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.557
Now who better at that than me?

04:51.859 --> 04:54.893
Then you ALSO must've heard
Starlight is in charge now.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.496
Really? I thought there
must be some mistake.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.099
Nope, Twilight picked
me for the job.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.969
And she left pretty detailed
instructions for me to follow.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.871
Well, I'm sure that
she wouldn't mind

05:05.973 --> 05:08.840
if I made a few
TINY suggestions.

05:10.544 --> 05:14.212
Item one, gravity is optional.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.048
Whoa!

05:18.986 --> 05:21.520
Item two, the
school's new mascot

05:21.622 --> 05:23.889
is an ambidextrous marmoset.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.660
Item three...

05:28.762 --> 05:29.729
Not gonna happen.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.397
I promised Twilight I'd
handle this her way.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.365
So thanks, but no thanks.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.170
Reeeeeeally?

05:38.672 --> 05:43.241
Well, we'll see if
you change your mind..

05:47.080 --> 05:47.879
Uh oh.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.581
When we play Ogres
and Oubliettes,

05:49.683 --> 05:52.251
and he puts that many
eeeees in "really",

05:52.453 --> 05:54.086
things don't usually end well.

05:54.288 --> 05:55.371
Don't worry, Spike.

05:55.472 --> 05:57.655
Discord and I are old
save-Equestria buddies.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.590
He'll be fine.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.292
Now, what's next
on Twilight's list?

06:08.835 --> 06:11.503
OK, I hid the artifacts
for the Spellvenger hunt

06:11.605 --> 06:13.505
and ordered school
supplies for the week.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.975
All you have to worry
about is teaching class.

06:16.177 --> 06:17.576
Ah. Thanks, Spike.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.644
Maybe we will get
through this OK.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.690
Come in, come in, you'll
let the twittermites out.

06:32.926 --> 06:33.825
Twittermites?

06:34.995 --> 06:35.928
OW!

06:36.230 --> 06:38.463
Discord! What are you doing?

06:39.966 --> 06:42.100
Nopony was at
your desk.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.669
Imagine what
Twilight would say!

06:45.171 --> 06:47.305
Oh! How could
you, Starlight?

06:47.507 --> 06:50.409
You've broken my trust
and failed me completely!

06:50.911 --> 06:52.811
Oh, don't worry,
I'll cover for you.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.213
By the way, I hope you
like Limburger cheese.

06:55.315 --> 06:57.749
I got a month's supply
for the teacher's lounge.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.419
Aaah!

07:05.192 --> 07:07.326
We'll take it from
here, Discord.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.529
Go relax, have a
cup of tea. At home.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.200
Ah! Some thanks for all my help.

07:15.302 --> 07:19.304
And after I hired all those
substitute teachers for you.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.242
Actually, that does
sound kinda helpful.

07:23.344 --> 07:25.744
And it was next
on our to do list.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.048
WHICH teachers did you hire?

07:33.120 --> 07:36.454
They call it making friends
because you have to

07:36.557 --> 07:38.990
MAKE creatures be
your friends!

07:39.292 --> 07:41.159
Show me what
you got, Yak.

07:44.497 --> 07:45.196
Ahem.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.331
Be my friend.

07:46.533 --> 07:49.402
If you're quiet, I don't buy it!

07:50.704 --> 07:51.771
Be my friend!

07:52.673 --> 07:55.674
I've heard pudding
that's more convincing!

07:58.045 --> 07:59.311
BE. MY.

07:59.413 --> 08:00.145
FRIEND!

08:03.650 --> 08:05.917
That's not how Twilight
teaches friendship.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.991
Some field trip!

08:13.193 --> 08:14.760
Where's my iced tea?

08:18.431 --> 08:19.731
This is too cold.

08:22.969 --> 08:24.203
Now it's too hot!

08:28.008 --> 08:30.842
Now it's too TEA-FLAVORED!

08:31.344 --> 08:33.144
You call yourselves friends?

08:34.815 --> 08:37.716
That is definitely not how
Twilight teaches friendship.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.026
You hired a TREE
as a teacher?

08:48.228 --> 08:49.894
Its schedule was free.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.296
Spike: Uh, guys?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.465
That's not
just any tree.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.036
Achoo!

08:56.638 --> 08:59.137
[blowing] It's a
Dragonsneeze tree.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.714
W-Wait Wait! Calm down,
every creature.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.049
It's gonna be OK!

09:11.351 --> 09:12.351
Hi-YA!

09:13.587 --> 09:16.321
BE MY FRIEND!

09:16.423 --> 09:18.790
♪♪

09:18.892 --> 09:23.194
My my my, you do seem like
you're in over your head.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.196
Won't Twilight be
so disappointed

09:25.298 --> 09:29.167
with how you're ruining, I
mean RUNNING her school?

09:39.046 --> 09:42.381
Discord! This is
all your fault!

09:42.583 --> 09:45.984
Mine? I thought YOU
were in charge here.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.553
But I'm happy to pitch
in if you need me.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.323
What I need is
for you to leave!

09:54.961 --> 09:56.261
Happy now?

09:56.763 --> 09:57.996
Come on, Discord.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.764
You know that's
not what she means.

09:59.866 --> 10:00.766
Fine.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.901
From now on, I
won't try to help.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.769
AT ALL!

10:07.474 --> 10:08.440
Thanks, Spike.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.409
Let's just hope
he stays gone.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.043
I wouldn't count on it.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.045
I think Discord's
trying to test you.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.547
But why?

10:15.749 --> 10:17.116
I thought we were friends!

10:17.318 --> 10:18.817
Well it's kinda what he does.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.919
Even to ponies or
dragons he cares about.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.622
Oh. Well, I'm ready
for him.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.424
I told Twilight I'd
run her school right,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.727
and I'm gonna
keep that promise.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.362
No matter what..

10:37.804 --> 10:39.538
Starlight: Good morning, students!

10:39.640 --> 10:41.906
I know there's been a little
bit of adjustment

10:42.008 --> 10:43.942
since the Professors
left for their trip,

10:44.044 --> 10:46.678
but I've brought in
new new teachers,

10:48.148 --> 10:50.649
and now everything
should run smoothly!

10:51.351 --> 10:52.484
Now it's time for class!

10:52.586 --> 10:56.087
And don't forget, this afternoon
is the Spellvenger hunt!

11:02.028 --> 11:03.127
[door slams open]
[startled gasps]

11:03.330 --> 11:06.497
Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.100
Is this seat taken?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.204
Welcome class!

11:13.306 --> 11:17.242
You may call me the Great and
Powerful Professor Trrrr--

11:20.013 --> 11:20.879
Shh!

11:21.281 --> 11:23.649
Really, that's so inconsiderate.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.054
Oh, I'd better take this.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.424
Hello?

11:32.926 --> 11:34.993
Oh, he did not.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.227
And what did you say?

11:36.429 --> 11:39.063
[gasp] You did not!

11:39.365 --> 11:42.734
Discord, why are <i>you</i> here?

11:42.936 --> 11:45.003
Why I'm a student of
friendship, of course!

11:45.105 --> 11:48.173
Unless you don't think you're
good enough to teach me...

11:48.375 --> 11:50.176
Of course, I am!

11:51.378 --> 11:53.211
No fruit calls in my class.

11:57.451 --> 12:00.919
Magic is the most important
element of friendship.

12:01.121 --> 12:06.825
So today, I, the Great and
Powerful Trixie, will put on...

12:06.927 --> 12:08.359
A MAGIC SHOW!

12:22.943 --> 12:26.745
Oh, oh oh, I'm learning
SO much, aren't you?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.748
GRRRRRR...Discord!

12:35.555 --> 12:37.022
Hello?

12:37.324 --> 12:40.558
Um, what exactly IS a
long-distance plan?

12:45.332 --> 12:46.832
Take a lap, team!

12:47.534 --> 12:51.770
Uh, actually, we just finished
Professor Spitfire's workout.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.039
Sounds like somepony
needs a little motivation.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.383
I've never run so
fast in my life!

13:04.785 --> 13:05.850
This is great!

13:07.954 --> 13:09.488
Huh. Hey, Coach?

13:09.790 --> 13:10.889
We need a break.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.591
Friendship is about honesty.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.594
So believe me when I say...

13:15.796 --> 13:17.195
We're not stopping!

13:24.170 --> 13:27.472
Yona...can't run...faster.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.848
Discord, that's enough!

13:37.250 --> 13:39.684
Endangering students
crosses the line!

13:39.886 --> 13:42.287
I don't know why you're
trying to ruin this school,

13:42.489 --> 13:44.055
but it stops now!

13:45.926 --> 13:48.293
I wouldn't be so sure.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.663
This is your last warning...

13:52.065 --> 13:54.099
Hey, take it easy, Starlight.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.934
Discord's your friend, remember?

13:56.236 --> 13:57.837
Well, he's not acting like it.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.038
She's right, Discord.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.372
What's your problem?

14:01.674 --> 14:02.808
My problem?

14:02.909 --> 14:05.843
How is the fact that Twilight
decided to put an incompetent,

14:05.946 --> 14:10.515
power-hungry unicorn in charge
of her school MY PROBLEM?

14:20.126 --> 14:22.327
Ha ha hah.. Don't worry.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.163
I just banished him from
school grounds forever.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.397
He's fine!

14:29.803 --> 14:31.803
That probably made
things worse.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.604
Why didn't you just
talk to Discord?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.473
Because he's right
about one thing..

14:35.575 --> 14:38.376
I've been doing a
terrible job as Headmare.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.744
No, you haven't!

14:40.046 --> 14:42.247
Discord is just
being... Discord.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.266
Maybe.

14:43.667 --> 14:46.884
But I wonder why me being in
charge bothers him so much.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.388
We can figure that out
AFTER the Spellvenger Hunt.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.290
Come on!

14:55.428 --> 14:57.595
For this afternoon's
Spellvenger Hunt,

14:57.797 --> 14:59.697
you'll need to use the
artifacts' history

14:59.799 --> 15:02.067
to find where they're
hidden in the castle.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.436
When you spot one, touch
it with a magic shield

15:05.538 --> 15:06.905
to keep track
of your score.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.508
Twilight left a list of your
hunt partners before she left.

15:10.610 --> 15:11.710
I'll pass out the shields.

15:15.949 --> 15:19.117
Ready, set... Spellvenger Hunt!

15:21.688 --> 15:24.589
C'mon, we can use Twilight's
observatory to watch the teams!

15:28.661 --> 15:30.428
I hope you know
where you're going.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.330
To the Helm of Yksler!

15:32.604 --> 15:33.837
Eh, works for me.

15:37.538 --> 15:41.271
In our book, it says Yksler
was an honorable Yak warrior.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.809
Any enemies that saw him put
down their weapons in peace.

15:44.911 --> 15:48.880
I think his artifact must be in
one of these suits of armor.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.219
I'm guessing that one.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.459
Yes! One down, five to go!

16:04.364 --> 16:07.933
Aw, Ocellus and Smolder
found their first artifact!

16:08.535 --> 16:09.701
Wait. What's that?

16:12.773 --> 16:15.740
I... don't think that's part
of the Spellvenger Hunt.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.945
The school is haunted!

16:21.047 --> 16:22.914
Agh! Not cool!

16:28.021 --> 16:31.288
We're totally gonna win
this Spellvenger Hunt!

16:31.391 --> 16:33.258
Yeah, I doubt that.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.460
But at least I know where
one of the artifacts is.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.362
Saw Spike hide it yesterday.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.735
The Crown of Grover!

16:43.937 --> 16:44.969
Score!

16:46.907 --> 16:49.474
They say it's magic, and King
Grover used it to become

16:49.576 --> 16:51.542
the first ruler of Griffonstone.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.644
I know, pretty sweet, right?

16:53.746 --> 16:56.114
You paid attention in class!

16:56.416 --> 16:58.482
What! If you
ever tell an-

17:00.820 --> 17:03.553
Whoa! 3-D painting!

17:17.804 --> 17:21.005
Ha ha ha! Hoo hoo!

17:21.607 --> 17:24.175
Yep, that's definitely Discord.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.743
This is not good.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.778
I thought you banished
him from the school!

17:27.880 --> 17:28.914
Only his body.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.749
Apparently, his ghost can
come and go just fine!

17:32.051 --> 17:33.918
Let's go, we have to stop this.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.923
How? No offense, but
I don't think magic

17:39.025 --> 17:40.424
is the answer
against Discord.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.127
This time, I'm not using magic.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.530
Hmm.

17:46.632 --> 17:47.832
What Yona look for?

17:47.934 --> 17:49.800
The shell of Knuckerbocker.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.904
It's like a seashell, but if you
blow into it, you call a dragon!

17:54.006 --> 17:56.140
There's a sweet poem
in our book about it.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.211
"Climb to the heights with
dragon flight."

18:00.213 --> 18:03.381
[gasp] Like flight of stairs!

18:03.783 --> 18:05.483
Yona take pony word for it.

18:07.821 --> 18:08.487
Huh?

18:12.325 --> 18:14.059
What's happening!?

18:14.561 --> 18:16.327
Y-Yona not know!

18:16.429 --> 18:20.565
But Yona DO know Yona not
like Spellvenger Hunt!

18:23.069 --> 18:24.903
Hahaha ha.

18:25.005 --> 18:26.337
Ho ho ho ho!

18:26.439 --> 18:28.106
Ah! Boo Boo-boo!

18:46.071 --> 18:47.971
Oo! Woah!

18:49.696 --> 18:51.363
Everycreature, stop!

18:52.265 --> 18:55.033
But-but-but the
school is haunted!

18:55.235 --> 18:57.736
It's not haunted; it's Discord.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.872
Headmare Starlight!
Look at me, look!

19:01.974 --> 19:03.908
I won the Spellvenger Hunt!

19:04.010 --> 19:05.243
Well done me!

19:05.345 --> 19:06.611
Now what's my prize?

19:07.113 --> 19:08.146
Detention.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.148
Well, that's disappointing.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.855
Discord, you can't keep
messing up the school.

19:18.157 --> 19:22.227
On the contrary, I think
I rather can, and will.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.897
Then I have just one
thing to say to you.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.199
Oh, do go on.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.567
I'm sorry.

19:30.469 --> 19:31.235
What?

19:33.640 --> 19:36.908
I had to stop thinking like a
Headmare and start thinking

19:37.010 --> 19:39.710
like a Guidance Counselor
to finally understand.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.345
You felt left out.

19:41.447 --> 19:45.850
Uhh...... I-I-I-I don't know what
you're getting at.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.453
Nopony ever invited
you to the school.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.289
And when you offered to
help, I didn't listen.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.991
I was so worried about doing
things Twilight's way,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.961
I didn't stop to think
about being a good friend.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.030
I'd like to apologize for that.

19:59.332 --> 20:02.066
And offer you the
job of vice-headmare.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.300
-Huh?
-Really?

20:03.402 --> 20:04.335
-What?
-Why?

20:04.437 --> 20:06.137
Totally confused.

20:07.273 --> 20:08.773
I ACCEPT!

20:10.275 --> 20:14.011
I mean, I.. I suppose I can find
some time in my busy schedule

20:14.113 --> 20:15.046
to help you out.

20:15.148 --> 20:18.849
But I will need my own office,
expense account, parking space.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.219
You're new to the world
of education, aren't you?

20:21.721 --> 20:25.123
Next time you want something,
just ask for it, all right?

20:25.625 --> 20:29.160
But then we'd miss out on all
these delightful misadventures.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.596
Hey! Watch the wings!

20:32.498 --> 20:35.433
Now, vice-headmare Discord,
if you'll help me get this

20:35.535 --> 20:37.134
Spellvenger Hunt back in order.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.639
Everything is re-hidden.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.407
Ah!

20:42.709 --> 20:46.344
[chuckles] Well, with
a few surprises.

20:48.848 --> 20:49.832
DISCORD!

20:50.233 --> 20:53.117
I can't believe you tricked us
into going on a friendship quest

20:53.219 --> 20:54.385
that wasn't real!

20:55.087 --> 20:57.688
Oh, back so soon?

20:57.790 --> 21:00.124
A glamour spell on
our cutie marks?

21:00.326 --> 21:02.460
A fake summons from the map?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.262
Hey, at least we got
to go spelunking

21:04.364 --> 21:05.963
in that really creepy
cave with all those

21:06.065 --> 21:08.633
eyeless worm
creatures chasing us.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.170
Oh, Yona so glad ponies back.

21:12.372 --> 21:16.341
Uh, y'all get the feelin'
we missed something?

21:17.043 --> 21:19.243
Thanks for taking care
of the school, Starlight.

21:19.345 --> 21:20.945
It was a challenge.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.013
But I think
things turned out

21:23.115 --> 21:24.616
just the way you'd
have handled them.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.818
Guess this means you're
not vice-headmare anymore.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.655
Ooh poo! I just ordered
business cards!
