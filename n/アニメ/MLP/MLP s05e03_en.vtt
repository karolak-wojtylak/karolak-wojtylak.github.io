WEBVTT

00:20.120 --> 00:21.653
Phew! Thanks
for helping me

00:21.655 --> 00:24.289
get them so fresh
and clean, Twilight.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.325
No problem!
Happy to do it.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.293
You probably can't wait to
get back to your castle

00:28.295 --> 00:30.462
and take your
own bath, huh?

00:30.464 --> 00:33.132
Aren't there more animals
that need cleaning?

00:33.134 --> 00:35.467
I think you and I are
the only ones left.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.170
And I can't wait to get
the mud out of my mane!

00:41.747 --> 00:43.970
Oh no! Angel
got dirty!

00:44.185 --> 00:46.981
I'd better stay longer to
help give him a bath, too.

00:59.093 --> 01:04.090
Regular Subtitles by YayPonies!
We have muffins!
http://main.yayponies.eu

01:29.873 --> 01:31.372
Thank you ever so
much for staying

01:31.397 --> 01:32.745
to give Angel a bath, too...

01:33.267 --> 01:35.397
But um, I think
he's dry.

01:39.991 --> 01:41.987
Goodness! It's
gotten late.

01:42.214 --> 01:44.564
You really didn't
have to stay all day.

01:44.981 --> 01:46.623
Not that we don't
appreciate it.

01:46.896 --> 01:47.873
Isn't that right?

01:54.467 --> 01:56.564
I for one am exhausted.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.511
Plus, I really
need to rest up

02:01.536 --> 02:03.873
for that big pancake
breakfast tomorrow!

02:06.004 --> 02:08.707
And I'm sure you have to
get the castle ready--

02:08.968 --> 02:11.061
No! The castle's...fine.

02:12.202 --> 02:15.103
But maybe I'd better see if
Pinkie Pie needs help

02:15.153 --> 02:16.244
with the pancakes!

02:23.642 --> 02:25.002
Um...Angel?

02:37.456 --> 02:39.532
These are delicious,
Pinkie Pie!

02:43.435 --> 02:46.101
Thanks! Twilight spent all night
helping me pick the flavor.

02:46.315 --> 02:47.667
I kept thinking we'd
found the right one,

02:47.734 --> 02:49.987
but she insisted I
make even more to try.

02:50.155 --> 02:51.528
And more. And more.

02:51.549 --> 02:52.568
And more. And more. And more!

02:52.614 --> 02:53.970
It was like she
never wanted to--

02:54.096 --> 02:54.724
--leave?

02:55.073 --> 02:56.126
Exactly!

02:58.021 --> 03:00.016
Eventually we ran out of
time so we just went with

03:00.105 --> 03:01.823
Everyberry Anychip Surprise.

03:02.138 --> 03:05.675
The surprise is I lost a
measuring spoon in the batter.

03:06.075 --> 03:08.783
Somepony's gonna get a
very special pancake.

03:09.482 --> 03:10.753
Up all night, huh?

03:10.993 --> 03:12.673
Is that why she's so...

03:12.888 --> 03:14.690
uh... out of it?

03:17.545 --> 03:20.227
Um, I don't mean to
sound unappreciative,

03:20.374 --> 03:22.433
but has anypony else noticed
that Twilight's been

03:22.450 --> 03:24.421
a little too helpful lately?

03:24.648 --> 03:26.892
Now that you mention it,
she was lendin' a hoof

03:26.913 --> 03:28.273
at Sweet Apple
Acres the other day

03:28.517 --> 03:30.223
and stuck around
till near midnight.

03:30.581 --> 03:33.473
Dug up fifty tree-plantin' holes
when all I needed was ten.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.496
She spent an entire
afternoon rearranging

03:38.513 --> 03:40.513
a single gem drawer
at the boutique.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.791
An entire afternoon!

03:42.955 --> 03:44.117
You think that's weird?

03:44.231 --> 03:47.107
She raced me, like, a hundred
times the other day

03:47.187 --> 03:48.433
and lost every time.

03:48.631 --> 03:49.776
She just kept going!

03:50.101 --> 03:50.800
Best out of ten.

03:51.002 --> 03:51.785
Best out of twenty.

03:51.823 --> 03:52.997
Best out of a hundred!

03:53.334 --> 03:55.966
I mean, I know hanging
out with me is awesome

03:56.004 --> 03:58.480
but it was like she'd
rather keep losing than--

03:58.576 --> 03:59.347
--leave?

03:59.528 --> 04:00.298
Yeah.

04:00.522 --> 04:01.814
Who does that?

04:06.547 --> 04:08.981
Somepony who's avoiding
something, that's who.

04:09.145 --> 04:11.545
Soon as she wakes up,
we're gonna find out what.

04:14.934 --> 04:15.886
I WIN!

04:17.077 --> 04:18.303
I'm pancake!

04:18.387 --> 04:19.915
I mean, awake!

04:21.136 --> 04:24.080
Uh, Twilight, is there
something you want to tell us?

04:24.837 --> 04:27.578
You know how much we
appreciate all you do for us,

04:28.686 --> 04:31.132
and we simply adore
having you around.

04:31.503 --> 04:33.760
But we worry you might be...

04:34.509 --> 04:35.667
avoiding something else?

04:36.054 --> 04:38.467
Oh, has it been
that obvious?

04:41.393 --> 04:42.210
I've been...

04:42.808 --> 04:43.671
The thing is...

04:43.890 --> 04:45.418
I know it's silly but I...

04:45.865 --> 04:48.496
I've been avoiding...this place.

04:49.578 --> 04:53.145
Why in Equestria
would you want to avoid

04:53.183 --> 04:55.002
such a gorgeous castle?

04:55.149 --> 04:56.837
Yeah, this place
has everything!

04:57.237 --> 04:59.772
Big tall ceilings that
make you feel tiny.

05:00.176 --> 05:02.644
Shiny new floors that
are cold to the touch.

05:02.791 --> 05:03.490
BRR!

05:03.870 --> 05:07.448
And it even has long
empty hallways...

05:07.498 --> 05:10.070
...hallways... hallways.

05:10.715 --> 05:12.547
OK, I get it.

05:12.804 --> 05:14.307
The castle is amazing.

05:14.669 --> 05:15.650
But it just...

05:17.200 --> 05:18.858
It doesn't feel like home.

05:20.610 --> 05:23.216
Is that all?

05:23.246 --> 05:25.562
Why you simply need
to decorate, darling.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.343
Make this space your own!

05:27.730 --> 05:29.145
It's just so daunting.

05:29.355 --> 05:30.509
Look how big it is.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.408
I don't even know
where to start.

05:32.955 --> 05:35.848
You can start by letting
us do it for you!

05:36.682 --> 05:38.707
We will make this the
castle of your dreams

05:38.951 --> 05:40.770
while you go the
Ponyville spa

05:40.821 --> 05:43.326
for some much needed
rest and relaxation.

05:43.776 --> 05:46.294
I'm saying this
with love, but...

05:46.808 --> 05:48.749
have you looked in
a mirror lately?

05:49.208 --> 05:50.593
I've never seen you look this...

05:52.357 --> 05:53.254
Frazzled?

05:53.578 --> 05:56.766
Yes, that is absolutely the
word I was going to use.

05:57.877 --> 06:01.705
I guess I do need a little
help, and so does my castle.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.595
And I just know
you'll do a great job

06:03.629 --> 06:05.793
because nopony knows
me better than you!

06:05.991 --> 06:08.341
We'll make this place feel
cozier than hot cider

06:08.366 --> 06:09.313
on a rainy day.

06:09.924 --> 06:11.334
There's gonna be cider?

06:13.330 --> 06:15.587
Uh...I mean, let's decorate!

06:15.848 --> 06:18.522
Oh no, did I miss the pancakes?

06:19.082 --> 06:22.303
I sleep like a baby under
that cold, cavernous ceiling.

06:22.442 --> 06:24.981
Spike, I'm so
glad you're here!

06:25.608 --> 06:26.117
Really?

06:26.442 --> 06:28.492
Yes. You're taking
Twilight to the spa.

06:28.842 --> 06:30.922
Great! I've been meaning
to get my claws done.

06:34.357 --> 06:36.138
Oh. You mean now.

06:43.595 --> 06:45.570

We did a great job.

09:28.012 --> 09:28.972
Together!

09:29.368 --> 09:30.724
Heh heh.

09:31.511 --> 09:33.790
Yeah, that sure is something.
We sure did.
Together

09:36.248 --> 09:40.732
Fluttershy, I love that you
brought so many animals.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.981
Are these your trophies?

09:43.111 --> 09:46.147
I prefer to think of them
as everypony's trophies.

09:46.181 --> 09:48.833
But with my name permanently
etched onto them.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.675
My my, Applejack.

09:52.012 --> 09:54.934
Bringing the outdoors
inside, it's...earthy.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.480
What a lovely touch.

09:58.526 --> 10:00.012
Are these quilts vintage?

10:00.374 --> 10:01.595
Nope. Just old.

10:02.008 --> 10:05.069
Unlike your sparkly window
doohickeys, which are...

10:05.270 --> 10:07.044
why, they're just swell.

10:07.670 --> 10:10.336
No one said anything about
my hidden confetti cannons!

10:11.204 --> 10:12.509
Oh right. They're hidden.

10:14.425 --> 10:18.766
Hey guys, how do my claws
look? SWEET CELESTIA!

10:19.208 --> 10:22.143
Oh! Spike! Are you and
Twilight done already?

10:22.791 --> 10:25.368
Don't worry, I ordered her the
super-deluxe mane blowout.

10:25.511 --> 10:26.307
She'll be a while.

10:26.837 --> 10:28.686
Man, this place looks terrible!

10:31.587 --> 10:33.856
Thank goodness somepony
said something.

10:34.138 --> 10:35.911
It's pretty bad, right?

10:36.223 --> 10:38.850
This place looks like a
mishmash of knickknacks.

10:39.048 --> 10:41.814
Hmmm, I suppose it is
a little cluttered.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.612
What are you guys talking about?

10:43.818 --> 10:45.440
I think it looks super fun!

10:50.345 --> 10:51.052
Whee!

10:51.338 --> 10:52.004
Oh no!

10:52.383 --> 10:53.035
Please don't do that.

10:53.713 --> 10:55.894
If we could all just take a
deep breath and calm down...

10:58.711 --> 11:01.242
No! That bunting is
embroidered by hoof!

11:01.406 --> 11:03.254
Don't you move one more paw!

11:04.307 --> 11:06.265
EVERYPONY STOP!

11:11.890 --> 11:12.917
OK, now it's a mess.

11:14.981 --> 11:16.404
What are we gonna do?

11:16.677 --> 11:19.587
I don't know, but Twilight's
blowout won't take that long!

11:19.898 --> 11:21.477
If she was avoiding
the castle before,

11:21.663 --> 11:23.368
she'll never set
hoof in here now!

11:23.835 --> 11:24.829
Come on, guys!

11:24.842 --> 11:26.223
We've gotta do something!

11:26.336 --> 11:27.882
Twilight's counting on us!

11:28.412 --> 11:31.806
Spike, you've got to get back
to that spa and stall her!

11:32.033 --> 11:34.218
Whatever you do, don't
let her come home!

11:34.505 --> 11:35.448
Like forever?

11:35.713 --> 11:36.560
But we live here.

11:36.934 --> 11:37.701
Uh...yes.

11:37.785 --> 11:39.456
Well uh, maybe you
could manage until...

11:39.733 --> 11:40.865
...sunsetish?

11:43.225 --> 11:44.854
Anything for you, Rarity!

11:46.888 --> 11:49.330
OK, we all agree the castle
is too cluttered, right?

11:49.785 --> 11:52.787
So why doesn't everypony take
one of their own decorations out

11:53.023 --> 11:54.206
and we'll see how it looks?

11:54.463 --> 11:55.574
Uh huh!

11:57.917 --> 11:59.417
Spike, you're back!

11:59.562 --> 12:00.880
How do I look?

12:02.421 --> 12:03.098
Great!

12:03.423 --> 12:05.658
And more importantly,
how does the castle look?

12:07.296 --> 12:08.122
Great!

12:08.320 --> 12:10.046
I can't wait to go
home and see it!

12:10.360 --> 12:10.913
Great!

12:11.330 --> 12:12.016
I mean, NO!

12:13.174 --> 12:15.814
I mean, uh, I'm not
quite ready to go yet.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.498
Why don't we have a massage?

12:17.800 --> 12:19.831
I was really hoping to
get uh, this thingy!

12:20.340 --> 12:23.341
The extra strength hot
stone deep tissue massage?

12:24.821 --> 12:25.482
Yep.

12:25.856 --> 12:28.193
I think I'll just have
a traditional massage,

12:28.412 --> 12:30.113
but you go for it.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.661
Did somepony order massages?

12:33.827 --> 12:35.120
YEAH!

12:35.343 --> 12:37.397
Let's DO this, little dragon!

12:40.328 --> 12:42.307
Oh, I hate it when
he does that.

12:42.581 --> 12:44.130
Come with me, Princess.

12:47.246 --> 12:48.223
Come on, Rarity.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.082
Everypony has taken
somethin' out except you.

12:51.898 --> 12:52.656
I know!

12:52.829 --> 12:54.075
I simply can't decide.

12:54.450 --> 12:55.840
How about this?

12:56.231 --> 12:57.406
No! Not that!

12:57.440 --> 12:58.543
Anything but that!

12:58.930 --> 12:59.844
How about these?

13:00.117 --> 13:01.840
But those brighten
up the whole room!

13:02.021 --> 13:03.410
They're my favorite accent!

13:03.717 --> 13:05.473
Then let's lose the curtains.

13:05.583 --> 13:06.829
The room wouldn't
need brightening

13:06.846 --> 13:08.522
if they weren't
making it so dark!

13:08.644 --> 13:09.490
Not them!

13:09.587 --> 13:10.951
They're my favorite, too!

13:12.172 --> 13:14.021
They can't all be
your favorite!

13:14.378 --> 13:16.004
OK, I'm taking
down the portrait.

13:16.101 --> 13:17.928
We already know
what we look like.

13:22.715 --> 13:24.471
The room still looks a little
bit cluttered, doesn't it?

13:24.791 --> 13:26.522
Perhaps I'll take
down a poster or two.

13:26.644 --> 13:28.534
Only to be helpful, of course!

13:29.886 --> 13:31.920
OK, everypony calm down.

13:32.303 --> 13:34.488
I'm sure we can find a way
to remove the clutter...

13:34.711 --> 13:35.385
together!

13:35.587 --> 13:37.180
You're absolutely
right, dear.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.602
Hey! Those are my
warmin' quilts!

13:41.768 --> 13:42.673
Together!

13:45.347 --> 13:48.762
Fluttershy, tell your birds to
stop pecking at my balloons!

13:48.892 --> 13:51.393
I guess they must not like being
scared out of their wits

13:51.452 --> 13:53.983
by exploding confetti
cannons or something.

13:54.193 --> 13:56.088
But we can't get
rid of the cannons!

13:56.324 --> 13:57.751
I don't remember
where I hid 'em!

13:59.120 --> 14:00.421
Allow me to help you!

14:00.607 --> 14:02.006
Oh no, I'll help you!

14:02.033 --> 14:03.717
NOT IF I HELP YOU FIRST!

14:05.128 --> 14:08.404
Ah. Great
suggestion, Spike.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.166
I feel totally relaxed.

14:11.292 --> 14:14.509
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow!

14:14.661 --> 14:15.730
You wanna hop on?

14:15.920 --> 14:17.696
Maybe I can get us
to the castle faster.

14:22.858 --> 14:23.616
OW!

14:24.030 --> 14:25.124
I mean, how...

14:25.431 --> 14:26.741
nice is this day?

14:27.098 --> 14:29.326
I was hoping we could
take the scenic way back.

14:29.705 --> 14:30.610
I don't know.

14:30.837 --> 14:31.802
Come on.

14:32.021 --> 14:34.244
Walking is good for
post-massage circulation.

14:34.517 --> 14:35.132
Really?

14:35.397 --> 14:36.985
I've never heard
that theory.

14:39.940 --> 14:42.955
I really miss this place, Spike.

14:43.347 --> 14:45.587
We had so many wonderful
memories here.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.858
We did, didn't we?

14:49.646 --> 14:51.612
Oh Spike, I'm so sorry.

14:52.008 --> 14:55.284
Of course losing the Golden Oak
Library was hard for you too.

14:56.728 --> 14:57.802
I've got an idea!

14:58.248 --> 15:00.088
Why don't we have the
girls add some things

15:00.122 --> 15:02.488
to make the castle feel more
like your home as well?

15:02.753 --> 15:03.435
Really?

15:03.936 --> 15:04.631
Hop on!

15:10.383 --> 15:10.880
Ow!

15:11.237 --> 15:12.176
What are you doing?

15:12.517 --> 15:15.461
I, um, I just thought
of what I want.

15:16.050 --> 15:18.223
Oh. OK. What is it?

15:18.800 --> 15:19.393
It's a...

15:19.877 --> 15:20.593
Well, I want a...

15:20.950 --> 15:22.240
it's - I kinda need a...

15:23.044 --> 15:23.684
A bed.

15:24.732 --> 15:27.317
I thought you said you sleep
like a baby in the castle.

15:27.469 --> 15:30.454
Pfft! Everypony knows babies
are terrible sleepers.

15:30.669 --> 15:31.381
Let's go!

15:34.724 --> 15:37.402
There! Now nothing is
cluttering the castle!

15:37.852 --> 15:38.618
You're right.

15:38.863 --> 15:41.991
There is literally NOTHING
cluttering this castle!

15:42.871 --> 15:44.113
What do we do now?

15:44.501 --> 15:47.014
I hate to be the bearer
of more bad news,

15:47.183 --> 15:48.606
but it's almost sunset.

15:48.812 --> 15:49.978
If we don't figure
this out soon,

15:49.991 --> 15:52.202
it's going to look like we
didn't lift a hoof to help her.

15:52.665 --> 15:54.176
Why is this so hard?

15:54.378 --> 15:55.806
We're Twilight's best friends.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.524
This should be easy for us!

15:57.620 --> 16:00.328
She said it herself: if
anypony should be able

16:00.341 --> 16:03.077
to make her feel comfortable
in her new home, it's us.

16:03.831 --> 16:04.997
If we can't do it...

16:05.560 --> 16:07.692
...then Twilight will be
stuck living in a castle

16:07.717 --> 16:10.564
that just makes her
feel sad...

16:10.926 --> 16:14.270
...sad...sad.

16:14.597 --> 16:17.077
Wow, Fluttershy, I
didn't know you could be

16:17.094 --> 16:18.400
loud enough to echo.

16:24.770 --> 16:26.880
What do we do?
What do we do?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.404
If Twilight comes home
now she'll be like

16:28.463 --> 16:29.431
"What did you guys do?"

16:29.507 --> 16:30.976
And we'll have to
be like "NOTHING!"

16:31.195 --> 16:32.968
And then she'll be like
"I was counting on you!

16:32.989 --> 16:34.227
Some friends you are!"

16:34.252 --> 16:35.827
and we'll be like "AAAHHH!"

16:39.566 --> 16:40.968
Calm down, Pinkie.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.034
We just need to figure
out what we did wrong

16:43.052 --> 16:44.460
so we can make it right.

16:44.501 --> 16:46.235
Well, I didn't do
anything wrong.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.623
I did exactly what I would
do if this were my home.

16:48.884 --> 16:51.591
But it's not your home;
it's Twilight's home!

16:51.890 --> 16:54.597
Where she keeps all her
Rainbow Dash trophies?

16:54.964 --> 16:55.684
Touché.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.625
Maybe we're all a little guilty

16:57.642 --> 17:00.345
of making ourselves feel at
home instead of Twilight.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.747
Come on, y'all, we just need
to think about Twilight!

17:04.050 --> 17:05.528
What was it she
loved about living

17:05.549 --> 17:07.048
in the Golden Oak Library?

17:07.237 --> 17:08.795
Oh, everything!

17:08.997 --> 17:10.564
The books, the
smell of books,

17:10.762 --> 17:13.073
the joy she felt from
organizing books.

17:13.258 --> 17:15.456
Remember that time I crashed
into all those books

17:15.494 --> 17:18.597
attempting my Sonic Rainboom
after you guys just cleaned up?

17:20.063 --> 17:21.886
That was good times.

17:22.155 --> 17:23.427
Yeah, for YOU, maybe.

17:23.658 --> 17:24.770
Oh and Applejack,

17:24.951 --> 17:27.418
remember when we were stuck
having a sleepover there?

17:27.831 --> 17:30.071
That turned out
to be so much fun!

17:30.505 --> 17:33.650
Remember the time it got
blown up to smithereens?

17:35.317 --> 17:37.124
Wait, no. That
was the worst!

17:37.772 --> 17:40.277
We had a lot of good
memories there, though.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.178
That's what made the
Golden Oak Library home.

17:46.113 --> 17:47.823
That's it!

17:49.208 --> 17:49.983
How's that one?

17:50.252 --> 17:50.837
Too soft?

17:51.149 --> 17:51.827
Too hard?

17:52.130 --> 17:53.141
Too lumpy?

17:54.320 --> 17:55.393
Ummm...

17:57.431 --> 17:58.892
Just right! I'll take it!

17:59.402 --> 18:00.922
Oh, thank goodness.

18:01.027 --> 18:02.913
I thought you'd never
find one you liked.

18:03.140 --> 18:05.191
Let's find a salespony
and get out of here.

18:05.510 --> 18:07.090
Sounds good to me!

18:07.452 --> 18:09.444
I mean, uh...

18:11.141 --> 18:12.084
Do you hear that?

18:14.420 --> 18:14.997
Too squeaky.

18:15.486 --> 18:16.303
Better keep looking.

18:19.717 --> 18:22.004
Maybe my plan won't
work after all.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.993
Of course it will,
darling! I can see it!

18:27.212 --> 18:28.766
You and Fluttershy stay here.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.052
Rainbow Dash and Pinkie
Pie, you come with me!

18:31.216 --> 18:32.593
We're going shopping!

18:32.783 --> 18:33.957
We'll meet back at the castle!

18:38.787 --> 18:41.482
<i> ♪ It's not the things</i>
<i> that you gather round. ♪</i>

18:42.778 --> 18:45.216
<i> ♪ It's not how much you own. ♪</i>

18:46.804 --> 18:50.677
<i> ♪ The things that hold the</i>
<i> meaning in your life, ♪</i>

18:50.698 --> 18:53.031

18:53.612 --> 18:58.661

18:58.686 --> 19:02.547

<i> we make this castle a home! ♪</i>

19:02.568 --> 19:10.181
<i> ♪ So we make, so we make, so</i>
<i> we make this castle a HOME! ♪</i>

19:16.235 --> 19:18.240
Hello? We're home!

19:18.800 --> 19:20.412
Welcome home!

19:20.884 --> 19:24.665
Oh. I, uh, love what you've
done with the place!

19:25.153 --> 19:26.858
You did such a good job of...

19:27.132 --> 19:29.945
preserving the integrity
of the original design.

19:30.134 --> 19:31.692
Oh, come on!

19:31.747 --> 19:33.444
It looks exactly the same!

19:33.608 --> 19:36.067
Do you know how hard it was to
keep her from coming back here?

19:36.320 --> 19:39.027
I never want to see another
dust ruffle as long as I live!

19:39.621 --> 19:40.235
Wait.

19:40.475 --> 19:42.000
Keep me from coming back here?

19:42.880 --> 19:45.418
It took a teensy bit
longer than we thought.

19:46.383 --> 19:49.667
What really makes home feel like
home isn't what it looks like,

19:49.894 --> 19:51.928
it's the memories you
make when you're there.

19:52.286 --> 19:54.947
So we made something that
celebrates the memories

19:54.968 --> 19:57.317
we've made with you since
you moved to Ponyville.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.538
The ornaments on the chandelier
are reminders of all the fun

20:07.570 --> 20:08.534
we've had together.

20:09.111 --> 20:11.452
That one shows your party at
the Golden Oak Library

20:11.477 --> 20:12.968
welcoming you to Ponyville.

20:13.368 --> 20:16.463
The time we shared donuts after
the Grand Galloping Gala.

20:17.393 --> 20:19.667
We were hoping that being able
to look at your beautiful

20:19.810 --> 20:22.943
old memories would inspire
you to make new ones.

20:23.221 --> 20:25.621
And the best part of it is
it's made from the roots

20:25.690 --> 20:26.947
of the Golden Oak Library.

20:27.128 --> 20:29.082
So you'll never forget
where you came from.

20:33.237 --> 20:35.461
It's exactly what
the castle needed.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.663
And I am ready to make
new memories here!

20:40.033 --> 20:43.381
Then let's start right now
with a new memory cake!

20:44.277 --> 20:47.002
Seven Layer What's-That-Flavor
Mystery Surprise!

20:47.136 --> 20:49.221
These might be chocolate chips

20:49.423 --> 20:52.037
or they might be super
spicy black beans.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.924
Let's go to the dining room!

20:54.223 --> 20:55.267
It's a little sparse

20:55.322 --> 20:57.456
but at least there's a
table and chairs.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.349
Whoa! What
happened in here?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.808
Last I checked this
place was empty!

21:03.393 --> 21:04.804
I couldn't help myself.

21:05.027 --> 21:07.225
It was just begging
for the personal touch.

21:07.524 --> 21:10.206
Truth be told, I
couldn't either.

21:10.429 --> 21:13.301
Your kitchen might have some
rustic farm decor, Twilight.

21:13.574 --> 21:15.991
And there may or may not be
some Daring Do posters

21:16.012 --> 21:17.031
up in your library.

21:17.397 --> 21:19.418
And some stuffed
animals in your bedroom.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.058
What was that?

21:23.225 --> 21:25.507
One of Pinkie Pie's
confetti cannons.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.886
What! It's not my fault
I hid them so well!

21:29.166 --> 21:31.174
Ah, Pinkie!
