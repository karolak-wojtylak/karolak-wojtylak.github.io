WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:06.705
Uh, Headmare Twilight?

00:06.807 --> 00:08.874
Sorry to bug you in
the teachers' lounge.

00:09.911 --> 00:12.077
Is it OK if I miss class?

00:12.279 --> 00:14.013
Mm hm. You can make
it up tomorrow.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.848
Actually, I'll be
gone for a week.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.884
A week!? In the middle
of the semester?

00:19.086 --> 00:21.520
Oh! Is everything
all right, Smolder?

00:21.922 --> 00:23.055
Not exactly.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.524
My brother's been
having a hard time

00:25.626 --> 00:26.959
since I left for school.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.527
I want to go home
and check on him.

00:28.629 --> 00:29.628
He's a really sweet guy,

00:29.730 --> 00:31.563
and the other dragons
can be kinda rough.

00:31.665 --> 00:34.399
Did you say sweet guy and
dragon in the same sentence?

00:34.501 --> 00:36.402
Yeah. He's sorta
like you, Spike.

00:36.904 --> 00:37.937
Aww!

00:38.439 --> 00:40.506
I'm sorry to hear about
your brother, Smolder.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.475
But the Dragonlands are really
far for you to go by yourself,

00:43.677 --> 00:46.378
and I'm not sure about you
missing so much class.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.814
Hey! What if she got
school credit for it?

00:48.916 --> 00:52.184
Kind of like a... Kindness
field trip! I'll go with her!

00:52.486 --> 00:56.121
Thanks! The Dragonlord is way
too busy for personal problems

00:56.223 --> 00:58.223
when it's baby-dragon-
hatching season.

00:58.325 --> 01:01.293
Baby-dragon-hatching season!?

01:01.595 --> 01:04.797
[gasp] All those cute little
snouts poking out of those

01:04.899 --> 01:09.101
adorable little shells?
Teeny tiny twitchy tails!

01:09.203 --> 01:11.103
Can I go too..?

01:11.505 --> 01:15.607
Well, you are the perfect pony
to lead a kindness field trip.

01:18.363 --> 01:21.280
[sigh] Fine. But I'm going to
expect a full report

01:21.382 --> 01:22.514
when you get back!

01:22.616 --> 01:23.983
How many pages?

01:24.085 --> 01:25.884
I was talking
to Fluttershy.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.253
Hatching season
sounds fascinating!

02:09.730 --> 02:12.331
Spike: OK, I made a list of what
cheers me up when I'm down,

02:12.433 --> 02:14.500
so if your brother's like
me, he's gonna love it!

02:14.702 --> 02:16.668
What should we do
first: the "smile" song,

02:16.770 --> 02:19.238
the sharing circle, or
friendship bracelet weaving?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.206
I'm not sure those
are the kind of things

02:21.308 --> 02:22.674
my brother's gonna be into...

02:22.876 --> 02:25.711
Well, what <i>would</i> make
your brother happy?

02:25.813 --> 02:28.280
Just having Spike and me
accept him for who he is

02:28.382 --> 02:29.948
will make a huge difference.

02:30.050 --> 02:33.318
Dragons who appreciate
his more sensitive side.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.187
I got it! Showtunes!

02:35.489 --> 02:36.922
Yeah, no. But
good try.

02:38.676 --> 02:41.926
Oh! Um, that's an
interesting smell.

02:43.264 --> 02:47.566
Ah! The stink of sulfur,
sharp rocks under my claws.

02:48.268 --> 02:49.668
It's good to be home.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.803
I can't wait to meet
your brother, Smolder.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.006
We're gonna be best
buddies, I just know it!

02:54.108 --> 02:56.842
He usually hangs out near
here. I'll go try and find him.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.146
Spike, do you mind
if I take a peek

03:01.248 --> 03:03.048
at the cute
little baby eggs?

03:03.250 --> 03:06.251
No problem! I'll stay here and
finish this comfort blanket.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.853
It'll be like a hug

03:07.955 --> 03:11.123
every time Smolder's brother
wraps it around himself.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.759
Aw, I'm sure he'll
love it, Spike.

03:15.461 --> 03:21.233
♪♪

03:21.335 --> 03:24.970
[excited gasp]
Oh, my goodness!

03:27.908 --> 03:32.377
Good morning, little one. I've
come a long way to meet you.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.880
Did you know there's a
whole wide world out here

03:34.982 --> 03:39.218
waiting to say hello?
Did you? Oh, did you boo? [cooing]

03:39.320 --> 03:41.520
It can't answer
you. It's an egg.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.590
Ah! Dragonlord Ember,
how nice to see you.

03:44.792 --> 03:48.860
Nice to see you too, uh
...which one are you again?

03:49.062 --> 03:52.097
The party one? Apple Dash?
Or was that the country one?

03:52.199 --> 03:55.801
Fluttershy. The one
who loves creatures.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.570
Are all these.. yours?

03:58.872 --> 04:01.373
WHAT? No! None
of them are.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.975
Watching over eggs is just
part of the glamorous life

04:04.077 --> 04:05.311
of a Dragonlord.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.547
I think it sounds wonderful.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.216
Yeah? Then maybe
you can help.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.819
[gasp] I'd love to! Just
tell me what to do!

04:14.321 --> 04:17.489
I don't know! It's my
first time being in charge.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.558
Dad wasn't big on sharing
Dragonlord details.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.361
It's.. kind of a burn
or be burned job.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.830
Well, I'm sure
you're doing great!

04:25.132 --> 04:28.066
Not really. The eggs should
have hatched by now...

04:28.168 --> 04:30.135
But none of them
have even cracked.

04:30.237 --> 04:33.739
Oh, dear. Maybe
they're lonely?

04:34.341 --> 04:37.242
Don't you worry. Auntie
Fluttershy's here.

04:37.344 --> 04:40.179
And the Dragonlord and I are
going to do everything we can

04:40.281 --> 04:42.514
to welcome you into this world!

04:42.816 --> 04:44.349
Really? How?

04:44.451 --> 04:46.184
Um. I have no idea.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.056
Now that's a thing of beauty.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.224
<i> ♪ [tense music] ♪</i>

04:53.326 --> 04:54.026
Whoa!

04:54.928 --> 04:58.330
Well, if it isn't our
little pony-friend, Spike.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.832
That's "Equestria's Official
Friendship Ambassador

05:00.934 --> 05:02.568
to the Dragonlands" to you.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.871
And I'm not little.
I had the molt, see?

05:08.042 --> 05:12.778
Ooh, runt's got wings!
I'm <i>so</i> impressed...

05:12.980 --> 05:14.379
What's that supposed to be?

05:14.881 --> 05:15.580
Nothing!

05:17.050 --> 05:18.283
Agh!

05:18.385 --> 05:21.386
Looks like a...
baby blanket to me.

05:21.488 --> 05:25.324
It's not a baby blanket!
It's a... comfort blanket.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.797
Aww... Did your pony
pals make it for you

05:31.899 --> 05:34.499
with friendship and gumdrops?

05:34.601 --> 05:36.568
No... I made it.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.371
And by the way, knitting is
a lot harder than it looks.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.406
Check out the baby
blanket, guys!

05:41.608 --> 05:43.775
It's a lot harder
than it looks!

05:44.276 --> 05:44.987
Hup!

05:45.512 --> 05:47.212
Got your bwankie!

05:47.314 --> 05:49.448
Aw, the little baby crying...

05:49.850 --> 05:51.082
Whoa, miss!

05:52.920 --> 05:55.621
Bet he broke a claw
and everything! Hah!

05:56.623 --> 05:58.824
Give it back! That's
for my friend!

06:01.361 --> 06:02.161
Cut it out!

06:02.262 --> 06:04.062
You know laugh-fire is
dangerous! It can...

06:06.299 --> 06:07.232
...do that.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.199
Garble!

06:08.501 --> 06:09.401
Smolder?

06:09.603 --> 06:10.869
What are you doing here?

06:14.508 --> 06:15.841
How's it scalin', bra?

06:17.511 --> 06:19.978
We'd better get out of here
before your brother shows up.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.714
Garble isn't very nice
to sensitive dragons.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.717
But... Garble
IS my brother.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.018
Your brother!?

06:27.120 --> 06:30.089
Got a problem with
that, ponyboy?

06:30.791 --> 06:31.990
Oh, brother.

06:36.506 --> 06:37.606
Ohhh..!

06:37.731 --> 06:41.133
I've missed you, bro! We got
a lot of fun to catch up on.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.034
There's no lava
diving at school.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.737
Good luck getting
Garble to do anything.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.873
Huh. Yeah, he's been so
weird since you left.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.342
Hiding, and
moping around...

06:51.444 --> 06:52.444
I have not!

06:52.546 --> 06:53.745
Have so!

06:53.847 --> 06:56.314
Easy, guys. I learned
at Twilight's school,

06:56.416 --> 06:59.351
ganging up on each other isn't
half as cool as you think.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.855
Aw, Pony school made you soft.

07:03.357 --> 07:05.490
Wanna try me and find out?

07:05.592 --> 07:07.559
[gulp] Maybe later.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.962
So... Let's get lava
diving! Whaddya say?

07:11.064 --> 07:13.064
Better stay here, shrimp.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.401
Lava might ruin your
blankie-wankie...!

07:16.603 --> 07:17.936
Let the wimp tag along.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.605
Then we'll have
somedragon to dunk! Hahaha!

07:20.807 --> 07:25.210
Hm! Only gonna warn you
once. Spike's my friend.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.546
You mess with him,
you mess with me.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.849
Besides, he came here to
hang out with YOU, Garble.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.189
Aw, how sweet...! Hah!

07:37.591 --> 07:39.958
Let's go do dragon stuff.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.094
Garble can have fun
with his new friend!

07:47.401 --> 07:50.335
But I'm not having fun!
And he's not my friend!

07:51.672 --> 07:53.605
Yeah just ignore them, GarGar.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.108
Smolder! Not in public!

07:56.610 --> 07:58.510
Oh, it's OK to
have a nickname!

07:58.612 --> 08:00.546
Sometimes I'm
called Spikey Wikey.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.182
Seriously? You're
admitting this?

08:03.784 --> 08:05.550
I am not hanging
out with him.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.754
Give him a chance, Garble. You
guys have a lot in common.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.424
Ugh. Fine. Race you to the Lava Pit.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.295
Wait! I thought you said
your brother was sweet.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.797
All the tough guy
stuff is just an act.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.599
He's a big marshmallow.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.200
Yeah. Not seeing it.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.603
Well, maybe a
burned marshmallow.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.539
Smoky on the outside,
but squishy inside.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.108
He just needs friends who
can appreciate that part.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.043
Like you.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.178
You're not
changing your mind

08:33.280 --> 08:35.313
about helping me
cheer him up, are you?

08:35.715 --> 08:37.115
Me? 'Course not!

08:41.688 --> 08:45.624
OK! Lava jumping, just
like old times, huh GarGar?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.392
Yeah. Just like old times.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.762
Except for one little,
<i>annoying</i> thing.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.298
Scales away!

08:55.068 --> 08:57.036
Come on in! The lava's fine!

08:59.139 --> 09:01.639
Ya know, whenever I'm
feeling a little down,

09:01.841 --> 09:04.075
it always helps if I do
something with a friend.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.277
How about we jump together?

09:08.315 --> 09:09.047
Agh!

09:10.984 --> 09:14.487
Ooooh. Spike? You OK?

09:15.689 --> 09:19.257
Er. I know there must be something
worse than lava up your nose.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.261
Ah ah ah ahchoo!

09:23.563 --> 09:25.464
I just don't know it is.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.265
CANNON BALL!

09:28.445 --> 09:29.645
Agh! [splash]

09:29.770 --> 09:31.636
Woohoo! Ha ha ha!

09:32.739 --> 09:33.571
Oops..!

09:39.546 --> 09:43.783
SWALLOWING lava. Swallowing
lava is definitely worse.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.151
My bad.

09:49.389 --> 09:53.258
And then they all lived
happily ever after!

09:53.960 --> 09:56.227
Time to come out, little ones!

10:02.235 --> 10:04.503
Maybe you'd like a song?

10:05.005 --> 10:07.906
I think you might be
encouraging them to stay in.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.509
Dragons aren't much for
touchy-feely stuff.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.810
Oh. I'm sorry.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.514
Goodness! Why are
the eggs shaking?

10:16.716 --> 10:18.583
[gasp] Are they finally hatching?

10:18.685 --> 10:21.219
I wish. They've been
doing that for days.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.088
I'm sure it means something.
But it's probably not good.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.692
Try this. Red velvet.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.894
Guaranteed to brighten
anycreature's spirits!

10:32.165 --> 10:33.965
Feeling better already.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.269
I don't know about you,
but a change of scenery

10:38.371 --> 10:40.705
always turns my
frown upside down.

10:40.907 --> 10:41.472
AAh!

10:46.113 --> 10:48.179
I will be the bigger dragon.
I will be the bigger dragon.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.549
I will be the bigger dragon.
I will be the bigger dragon.

10:50.751 --> 10:54.085
Sometimes just hearing what
someone appreciates about you

10:54.287 --> 10:56.654
can make you feel
better about yourself.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.089
I'll go first.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.226
Spike, I think
it's really nice

11:01.328 --> 11:03.628
that you're trying
to cheer up GarGar.

11:03.930 --> 11:04.963
Agh...!

11:05.065 --> 11:06.966
Thank you, Smolder.
My turn.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.834
I like how you always
let everycreature know

11:09.936 --> 11:11.503
how you're feeling, GarGar.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.506
ONLY SMOLDER GETS
TO CALL ME THAT!

11:16.243 --> 11:18.643
Thank you for
speaking your truth...!

11:21.147 --> 11:24.082
More fresh lava, comin' up!

11:31.892 --> 11:35.159
OK, NEW activity. Who wants
to make vision boards?

11:35.261 --> 11:39.030
Hey, Garble! Smolder! Surf's up!

11:43.103 --> 11:45.136
Let ME show you how it's done!

11:47.340 --> 11:48.206
You coming?

11:48.608 --> 11:50.409
I'll.. catch up with you.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.249
Ah Spike! There
you are!

11:58.551 --> 11:59.551
Hey, Fluttershy.

11:59.653 --> 12:00.952
For a land that's
all rocks,

12:01.054 --> 12:04.022
this place is surprisingly
easy to get lost in.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.690
How are the baby dragons doing?

12:05.792 --> 12:09.260
The eggs won't hatch!
They just keep shaking.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.763
I'm starting to think the
dragons are too scared

12:11.865 --> 12:15.033
to come out. I was
hoping you could help...

12:15.235 --> 12:16.534
...If you're not too busy

12:16.636 --> 12:18.203
cheering up Smolder's brother.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.807
Not a chance. Smolder's
brother is GARBLE.

12:22.709 --> 12:26.177
The only thing that cheers him
up is to make me miserable.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.447
Hey, Spike! Wanna
play lava ball?

12:30.371 --> 12:31.071
Huh!?

12:32.886 --> 12:36.854
Excuse me! But that's
not a very nice game.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.861
Ah, nearly got you!

12:43.363 --> 12:44.796
ENOUGH!!

12:47.034 --> 12:50.068
Ahem. I mean, leave my
friend alone, please.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.238
Spike came all this
way to cheer up Garble,

12:53.340 --> 12:55.840
which was a very
kind thing to do.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.776
Aw, do you need
cheering up?

12:58.878 --> 13:00.378
What's wrong, Garble?

13:00.480 --> 13:04.749
Did somedragon hurt
your wittle feewings?

13:04.851 --> 13:07.485
No! I don't know what
she's talking about!

13:07.587 --> 13:09.254
Spike's the one who's gonna cry!

13:09.356 --> 13:12.223
HEY! Are we lava
surfing or what?

13:12.425 --> 13:15.627
Uh yeah! Yeah! Let's go
hang with a REAL dragon.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.428
Not a pony wanna-be!

13:19.165 --> 13:21.199
See? It's no use.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.670
Why don't I see what I
can do about the eggs,

13:25.772 --> 13:28.607
and you cheer up Garble. At
least he listens to you.

13:29.509 --> 13:33.678
Just you wait, Garble. You're
dealing with Fluttershy now.

13:33.780 --> 13:37.115
And she's packing a whole
lifetime of kindness.

13:38.328 --> 13:39.328
Oh...

13:40.353 --> 13:45.354
Koochie koochie koo.
Koochie koochie koo...

13:45.856 --> 13:51.062
koochie! Koochie koochie
koo. [angry] I said Koochie!

13:51.164 --> 13:52.831
Spike: Uh, what are you doing?

13:52.933 --> 13:54.198
[gasp] SPIKE!

13:54.300 --> 13:55.233
Hi Ember!

13:55.735 --> 13:57.668
Shouldn't you be doing
whatever it is you do

13:57.770 --> 13:58.770
at Twilight's school?

13:59.272 --> 14:02.040
I wish. It's a long story.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.109
Wow. These eggs
really do look scared.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.950
Wait, aren't the hatching
grounds supposed to be hot?

14:12.152 --> 14:15.453
Uh of course! There's a lake
of molten lava under them.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.088
That's why the
eggs are laid here;

14:17.190 --> 14:18.489
the heat makes them hatch!

14:18.791 --> 14:20.058
Then something's wrong.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.326
I don't think the
eggs are shaking

14:21.428 --> 14:23.528
'cause they're
afraid. They're cold.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.901
You're right! But what
happened to the lava?

14:29.903 --> 14:32.036
I might have an idea.

14:33.440 --> 14:38.309
Garble? Smolder? Is
any dragon there?

15:15.481 --> 15:16.216

15:18.018 --> 15:19.817
I wondered where that

15:19.919 --> 15:22.086
They must be draining it
from the underground lake!

15:22.410 --> 15:23.210
Grr!

15:26.026 --> 15:28.327
Put that rock back! Immediately!

15:29.029 --> 15:31.262
Uh, yes, Dragonlord Ember!

15:31.564 --> 15:34.266
How long have you been
removing these boulders?

15:35.368 --> 15:37.336
A while..?

15:38.638 --> 15:42.507
It made our lava pools
so nice and warm-like.

15:43.009 --> 15:45.576
Ah! It's supposed to be
heating the EGGS!

15:45.978 --> 15:47.712
Now they'll never hatch!

15:57.056 --> 15:58.656
Sorry, Dragonlord Ember!

15:58.758 --> 16:00.258
We'll put the lava back!

16:00.660 --> 16:06.397
Agh! Here you go, lava! Aw come
on! Don't you have to go!

16:06.499 --> 16:06.998
Faster!

16:07.100 --> 16:08.099
It's liquidy!

16:08.301 --> 16:09.834
I don't think it works that way.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.602
The hatching grounds can't be the
only warm place in the Dragonlands.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.605
There's got to be somewhere
else we can take the eggs!

16:14.808 --> 16:16.574
You know how fragile
those things are?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.877
No way we'll be able to
move them all safely.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.579
Grr! YOU! Go and bring
all the dragons

16:21.681 --> 16:22.714
to the hatching grounds.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.448
We'll have to make
the heat ourselves.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.321
What do you think you're doing
sneaking around here, Pony?

16:30.423 --> 16:33.825
Sneaking? It looks to me like
the only one sneaking around

16:33.927 --> 16:37.696
is you, Garble. Why didn't
you tell me you were a poet?

16:38.398 --> 16:39.263
I'm not!

16:51.477 --> 16:54.012
Sure sounds like poetry to me.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.746
It's OK, GarGar.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.483
Fluttershy won't think you're
soft for being a poet.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.453
And neither would anydragon
who was your real friend.

17:02.355 --> 17:06.958
Ugh. OK, fine. But I'm not a
flowery namby pamby poet.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.627
I'm a beat poet...dig?

17:09.729 --> 17:11.863
I totally feel you!

17:12.165 --> 17:14.132
And you better not tell
my friends about it!

17:14.434 --> 17:17.135
But...why? If I was a poet,

17:17.237 --> 17:20.004
I'd want to share my
creations with everypony.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.206
I'm the only one Garble
will perform for.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.642
He hasn't written any
poetry since I left.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.478
That's why he's been so sad.

17:27.680 --> 17:31.315
I NEED to create! But if the
other dragons ever found out

17:31.417 --> 17:34.653
I like this junk, they'd
make fun of me. Forever.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.388
Is that why you pick on Spike?

17:37.490 --> 17:39.857
To make your friends
think you're tough?

17:40.159 --> 17:42.927
Wait. You've been
picking on Spike?

17:43.229 --> 17:45.764
Uhh. Only when you're not looking...

17:46.066 --> 17:48.967
But if I didn't pick on Spike,
they'd just pick on me.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.968
And he is kind of a weakling...

17:51.070 --> 17:54.438
Hmmph! I'll have you know Spike
is STRONGER than you are!

17:54.540 --> 17:55.406
Any day!

17:55.708 --> 17:57.942
Yeah, right. That

18:01.514 --> 18:05.083
[gasp] First of all, there's nothing
wrong with being a pony!

18:05.285 --> 18:08.419
Second, Spike isn't
afraid to be who he is,

18:08.521 --> 18:11.923
no matter what you...
or anycreature thinks.

18:12.025 --> 18:16.595
That's real strength... Not
like somedragons I know.

18:17.097 --> 18:20.432
For a pony without a horn,
she's sure got a point.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.900
I've been looking all
over for you guys!

18:23.002 --> 18:24.569
We need your
help! Hurry!

18:40.353 --> 18:42.487
I've ordered everydragon
to warm up the eggs,

18:42.589 --> 18:43.921
but they still won't hatch.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.790
I don't know what
else we can try!

18:45.892 --> 18:49.594
We can't give up! There's got
to be something we can do.

18:49.696 --> 18:53.932
How 'bout we wrap the eggs
in a bunch of baby blankets?

18:54.834 --> 18:58.370
Heheh! Yeah! The wimp can knit
'em up real quick-like.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.540
Hey, watch it! That laugh-fire
could burn someponies!

19:08.381 --> 19:11.152
Burn! Good idea, Spikey Wikey!

19:14.254 --> 19:17.488
Eggs. Come. Burst

The hero of the
Dragonlands, that's who!

20:52.819 --> 20:55.953
Yeah! Garble saved our eggs
because he was strong enough

20:56.055 --> 20:58.823
to be who he is, whether
you liked it or not.

20:59.025 --> 21:02.293
I grew up thinking it was OK
to make fun of differences.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.629
But my friends have taught
me to celebrate them!

21:08.768 --> 21:11.168
And from now on, in my kingdom,

21:11.370 --> 21:13.604
that's exactly what we will do!

21:13.906 --> 21:15.306
Now, if you don't
mind, can you teach me

21:15.408 --> 21:18.009
how to write poetry like
that? It's pretty cool.

21:18.211 --> 21:21.245
Uh, yeah. Sure, no problem!

21:21.547 --> 21:22.813
