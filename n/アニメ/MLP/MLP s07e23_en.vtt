WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:04.336
Pinkie Pie: OK. All we need is a
dot of salt, a dab of sugar

00:04.438 --> 00:05.937
and a spritz of ginger.

00:06.239 --> 00:08.907
Uh, are those real measurements?

00:09.109 --> 00:10.775
How do you keep track
without a recipe?

00:10.877 --> 00:13.111
Pie baking is more
art than science.

00:13.213 --> 00:15.547
And this will be
my masterpiece!

00:15.849 --> 00:18.083
It's to celebrate Rainbow
Dash's seventy-third

00:18.185 --> 00:20.052
Wonderbolt training session!

00:20.354 --> 00:22.888
Seventy-third?
That's specific.

00:23.090 --> 00:23.789
I know!

00:23.891 --> 00:26.625
The pie is blueberry because
Wonderbolt outfits are blue.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.961
The crust is rainbow,
for obvious reasons.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.964
But the most special part is
the seventy-three super-secret

00:32.066 --> 00:34.767
sweets and spices that represent
each training session!

00:35.869 --> 00:39.505
Could you please pass the brown
sugar, pink sugar, sweet-root,

00:39.607 --> 00:41.073
apple-jelly,
berry-mash and a towel?

00:44.677 --> 00:48.114
You sure are going to a lot of
trouble for Rainbow Dash's pie.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.650
Phew! That's because I know
how much she loves them.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.420
My pies are her favorite!

00:54.622 --> 00:57.889
It's worth all the
trouble to see her happy.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.725
Now I'm going to need some
cocoa powder, cocoa flakes...

00:59.827 --> 01:01.126
Ooh! Cocoa bar!

01:02.329 --> 01:03.162
Want some?

01:03.264 --> 01:04.664
Isn't that for the pie?

01:05.066 --> 01:08.767
[laugh] Oh, Twilight!
That's hilarious!

01:08.869 --> 01:11.437
You don't mix chocolate
into a blueberry pie!

01:11.639 --> 01:13.872
This is my mid-morning,
pie-making chocolate fuel that

01:13.974 --> 01:16.975
keeps this pie baking train
chugging down the tracks!

01:22.582 --> 01:23.415
Break time's over!

01:23.517 --> 01:25.250
Now let's finish this pie!

01:25.452 --> 01:27.852
Chugga-chugga
chugga-chugga CHOO-CHOO!

02:11.798 --> 02:13.332
Good training,
everypony.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.532
Nice work, Crash.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.635
You really added that sparkle
to that pressure-diamond-drop.

02:18.838 --> 02:20.439
SURPRISE!

02:20.541 --> 02:23.642
Happy seventy-third
Wonderbolt training session!

02:25.178 --> 02:27.312
My seventy-third
training session?

02:27.514 --> 02:28.513
That's specific.

02:28.715 --> 02:31.583
I know! I'm just so
proud and happy for you

02:31.685 --> 02:33.083
and I've been counting
all your training sessions,

02:33.185 --> 02:35.487
and I was going to wait until your
100th, but I got too excited

02:35.589 --> 02:36.922
and I know how
much you love pie,

02:37.024 --> 02:40.059
so HAPPY SEVENTY-THIRD
TRAINING SESSION!

02:40.361 --> 02:43.229
WHAA? You didn't
have to do this.

02:43.431 --> 02:47.132
I know I didn't have to,
but I really wanted to!

02:48.802 --> 02:49.569
Have a bite.

02:49.771 --> 02:51.136
Whoa! What's that?

02:52.072 --> 02:53.373
Huh. Guess it
was nothing.

02:53.475 --> 02:57.976
But wow, this pie is
the best I've ever had!

02:59.313 --> 03:01.013
Is that.. cinnamon?

03:01.115 --> 03:02.982
I knew you'd love it!

03:03.084 --> 03:05.651
Have more. I made the
whole thing for you.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.720
Really? That's so great!

03:09.022 --> 03:10.990
But I need to go change.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.459
And then I have to
take Tank to the vet.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.562
His sensitive tortoise
tummy's been acting up again.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.664
Do you mind if I take
this pie with me?

03:18.766 --> 03:20.165
Of course not!

03:20.267 --> 03:22.701
I gotta get back to my shift
at Sugarcube Corner anyway.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.603
Congratulations again!

03:24.705 --> 03:26.038
Heh, thanks.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.477
[happy sigh]
I knew she'd love it.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.218
Is that...

03:39.520 --> 03:40.519
Is that...?

03:43.623 --> 03:44.656
STOP!

03:47.795 --> 03:49.795
You didn't see a blueberry
rainbow crust

03:49.897 --> 03:51.030
seventy-three ingredient pie

03:51.132 --> 03:53.766
with a slice eaten out of
it in here, did you?

03:54.168 --> 03:56.435
Uh, n-no?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.470
Right. Of course you didn't.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.340
That would be ridiculous because
I made it for Rainbow Dash

04:01.442 --> 04:03.175
and she loves my pies.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.611
She would never throw them
away like trash, in the trash,

04:05.713 --> 04:06.945
with other trash, right?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.013
RIGHT?

04:08.115 --> 04:10.248
Um, right...?

04:12.786 --> 04:15.320
Hmm. That pie couldn't have
been the one I made,

04:15.422 --> 04:17.122
I must be seeing things.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.190
I did have a lot of
chocolate this morning.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.128
But what if I wasn't
seeing things?

04:23.330 --> 04:25.063
What if that was my pie?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.098
Heh. That would be bananas!

04:31.872 --> 04:34.773
Unless... Rainbow Dash's been
replaced by an imposter

04:34.875 --> 04:37.008
who throws delicious
pies away!

04:38.845 --> 04:43.148
Or has she been brainwashed
by a pie-hating evil queen?

04:45.718 --> 04:46.752
You make a good point.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.288
Rainbow Dash is too
stubborn to be brainwashed.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.657
Plus she hates washing.

04:50.859 --> 04:54.627
Hmmm. There's something
else going on here.

04:55.329 --> 04:58.697
Let's look up a few of the more
recent pies I've made for her.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.567
The boysenberry pie I
made for her birthday...

05:01.669 --> 05:04.036
and her three half-birthday
lemon meringues...

05:04.238 --> 05:06.471
and the It's Not Your Birthday
But Here's A Pie Anyway Day

05:06.573 --> 05:07.540
custard pie!

05:07.842 --> 05:10.877
She ate all of these, right?

05:11.879 --> 05:14.846
[gasp] Another pie!?

05:15.048 --> 05:16.648
Thank you so much!

05:16.950 --> 05:17.952
Whoa, what's that?

05:18.654 --> 05:21.453
[chewing] Guess it was nothing.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.254
Heh heh.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.056
Awesome!

05:24.258 --> 05:26.458
Three lemon meringues?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.459
Uh.. hey, what's that over there?

05:31.064 --> 05:33.365
[chews] Oh, never mind. Heh.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.568
Great pies!

05:36.770 --> 05:39.905
Happy It's Not Your Birthday
But Here's Pie Anyway Day!

05:40.107 --> 05:41.272
Thank you!

05:41.474 --> 05:42.907
No way, check that out!

05:45.578 --> 05:48.280
A-ha! It's not even my birthday!

05:49.182 --> 05:51.750
Oh, sorry, guess
it was nothing.

05:51.952 --> 05:52.851
[slurp] Mm.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.720
But that custard
was everything!

05:57.189 --> 06:01.093
Have I ever really seen Rainbow
Dash eat one of my pies?

06:01.595 --> 06:03.896
And do I always look when
somepony points behind me?

06:04.898 --> 06:05.598
WHAT'S THERE?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.599
Heh. Good one.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.401
But I need answers!

06:12.004 --> 06:13.372
I've sent Rainbow Dash a pie

06:13.474 --> 06:15.073
every month she's
been a Wonderbolt

06:15.175 --> 06:18.277
and you're telling me you've
never seen her eat one?

06:18.679 --> 06:21.747
Er...... Affirmative!

06:22.649 --> 06:24.116
Or uh, negative.

06:24.218 --> 06:27.419
Um.. I-I-I mean, she wasn't
seen eating one.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.788
Hmm... interesting.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.491
Very interesting....

06:33.193 --> 06:34.826
Are we under investigation?

06:34.928 --> 06:37.062
As chief detective
on the pie case,

06:37.264 --> 06:39.431
I've labeled you all
ponies-of-interest

06:39.633 --> 06:42.335
so it's best you tell
me everything you know.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.303
Well, we have been
getting mysterious

06:45.405 --> 06:46.772
monthly pie donations.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.275
Would you be able to pick
these pies out of a line up?

06:53.679 --> 06:55.881
I hear Rainbow Dash's
pet tortoise, Tank,

06:55.983 --> 06:57.882
has been having
tummy troubles.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.284
When did it start?

06:59.586 --> 07:00.919
About a week ago.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.389
Poor Tank had all the telltale
signs of sugar overload:

07:04.491 --> 07:06.991
jittery shell, sleeplessness,
reptilian indigestion.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.327
Hmm...

07:08.429 --> 07:10.462
and this all happened the day
after I made Rainbow Dash a

07:10.564 --> 07:13.165
"thanks-for-lending-me-your-
jacket" peach pie.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.135
It seems the pieces of the
puzzle are plopping into place,

07:17.237 --> 07:19.304
but the picture isn't pretty.

07:19.506 --> 07:22.107
[gasp] Note to self: P
alliteration pie.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.075
Is that everything, Doctor?

07:24.377 --> 07:25.910
Well, there's also this.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.547
Interesting.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.683
Did you have the lab analyze
the flavor of that pie?

07:31.985 --> 07:36.255
No, but you know, Ms. Cheerilee
was in here not long ago.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.091
The class hamster was
having similar symptoms.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.760
[gasp] Perhaps it's a pie pandemic!

07:41.862 --> 07:42.828
Perhaps.

07:42.930 --> 07:46.264
And I just might know
pony patient zero!

07:47.900 --> 07:49.200
Dr. Fauna's right.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.603
I do always have to remind
the foals and fillies

07:51.705 --> 07:53.638
not to share the pies with
the class hamster.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.408
Animals just can't
digest pony food.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.442
Indeed.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.778
But where do these
pies come from?

07:59.880 --> 08:01.546
Well, they're from
Rainbow Dash!

08:01.648 --> 08:03.281
She drops off her
"Day-after-Rainbow

08:03.383 --> 08:05.417
Dash's-half-birthday"
pie every year.

08:05.619 --> 08:08.353
Did you say the day
after her half birthday!?

08:08.555 --> 08:11.122
Very, very interesting.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.793
Because I give her a pie on
her half birthday every year!

08:14.895 --> 08:18.063
And I have a feeling
it's the same pie.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.800
Well, wherever it comes from,
the students just love it.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.302
I'm so glad.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.272
At least I can be
sure somepony is.

08:28.641 --> 08:32.611
She didn't eat the blueberry,
she didn't eat the banana,

08:32.713 --> 08:35.013
she didn't eat the cream and
she didn't eat the chocolate.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.815
SHE DIDN'T EAT ANY OF 'EM.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.217
WHY?

08:39.119 --> 08:41.486
And don't tell me this
all just started recently;

08:41.688 --> 08:43.955
it's been going on for years!

08:44.057 --> 08:45.657
Cheerilee said so herself.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.961
And if there's one thing I know,
you can't escape the truth!

08:59.606 --> 09:01.239
Rainbow Dash doesn't like PIE!

09:01.341 --> 09:04.975
AND SHE'S BEEN LYING TO ME
ABOUT IT THE WHOLE TIME!

09:05.878 --> 09:09.113
AAAAHHHHH!

09:12.785 --> 09:15.286
AAAAHHHHH!

09:15.388 --> 09:16.321
Pinkie Pie?

09:17.022 --> 09:17.956
Pinkie Pie?

09:20.026 --> 09:21.393
Whoa!

09:23.296 --> 09:25.864
Oh. Party Planning
Cave. Right.

09:27.399 --> 09:28.233
You OK?

09:28.435 --> 09:30.168
Or are you just
screamin' for fun?

09:30.270 --> 09:32.804
Screaming is fun,
but I'm not OK!

09:33.206 --> 09:35.173
I've been making Rainbow
Dash pies for years,

09:35.275 --> 09:36.441
but she doesn't
even like them!

09:36.543 --> 09:38.610
She's been lying to me!

09:39.012 --> 09:40.979
But everypony loves your pies!

09:41.081 --> 09:43.582
They're the greatest thing
since sliced apples.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.352
Thank you!

09:44.576 --> 09:47.153
And I could swear I've seen her
eat one of your pies before.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.588
Have you REALLY?

09:49.890 --> 09:54.926
Um, I thought I had;
that's why I said it?

09:55.028 --> 09:57.062
Are you suuure?

09:57.364 --> 09:59.665
Maybe I haven't?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.066
Exactly!

10:01.168 --> 10:02.801
Because it's all been a sham.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.937
Rainbow Dash has been laughing
at my pies behind my back

10:06.039 --> 10:08.873
and scheming of a way to get
rid of them for years!

10:12.813 --> 10:16.982
Bring forth the worst tasting
food in all of Equestria!

10:20.854 --> 10:25.323
And now I will destroy Pinkie
Pie's horrid abominations,

10:25.525 --> 10:30.161
freeing the land of these
disgusting pies FOREVER!

10:30.363 --> 10:32.463
Nooooooo!

10:34.768 --> 10:38.136
Good riddance strawberry
cream and peaches 'o plenty!

10:38.338 --> 10:41.272
Be gone apple crumble
and lemon surprise!

10:44.176 --> 10:46.311
Gone! Gone! GONE!

10:49.616 --> 10:51.917
I really don't think
that's what's happening.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.485
I don't think
so either.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.922
I know so.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.024
Well, I've got just the
thing to get your mind off

10:59.126 --> 11:00.292
all this madness.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.093
We've had a great apple harvest

11:02.195 --> 11:05.130
so I was hoping you could whip
up a few of your delicious pies.

11:05.732 --> 11:10.002
Yes, I will make
pies, lots of pies!

11:10.304 --> 11:12.671
I'm going to make Rainbow
Dash so many pies,

11:12.773 --> 11:14.406
it'll force her to
admit the truth,

11:14.508 --> 11:17.376
or I'll catch her in the
act of getting rid of them.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.245
Operation: Pie of Lies is a go.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.545
Thanks, Applejack.

11:21.647 --> 11:24.082
I knew I could count on
you to come up with a plan.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.851
I don't think
that's what I did.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.554
Also...how do you
get out of here?

11:32.058 --> 11:32.724
SURPRISE!

11:32.826 --> 11:34.559
Ah! What's happening?

11:34.961 --> 11:37.062
Happy unofficial
wake-your-friends-up day!

11:37.664 --> 11:41.099
Uh. I've never heard of
wake-your-friends-up day.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.501
Well, it's unofficial.

11:42.603 --> 11:44.903
But I made you your
favorite pie in celebration!

11:45.205 --> 11:45.971
Ta-dah!

11:46.073 --> 11:47.706
Gifts are the second
most important part of

11:47.808 --> 11:48.740
wake-your-friends-up day!

11:48.942 --> 11:51.042
W-What's the first
most important part?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.578
Accepting the gifts and
enjoying them immediately.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.014
Uh...

11:55.216 --> 11:58.284
Well, I'm sorry I forgot about
wake-your-friends-up day.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.986
Let me make it up to you.

12:01.688 --> 12:02.221
Here!

12:03.523 --> 12:04.490
Achoo!

12:13.132 --> 12:13.899
Achoo!

12:14.301 --> 12:15.734
The pie... where'd it go?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.636
What do you mean
where did it go?

12:17.738 --> 12:19.739
Ha ha. Mm mm.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.641
How!? Where!? When!?

12:29.115 --> 12:31.349
Congratulations on
your seventy-fourth

12:31.451 --> 12:32.717
Wonderbolt
training session!

12:33.019 --> 12:33.785
Here's a pie.

12:33.887 --> 12:34.721
Now eat it!

12:35.723 --> 12:38.824
OK, this is getting
a little out of hoof.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.159
I haven't even
trained yet.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.761
Well, I wanted
to pre-celebrate

12:42.863 --> 12:45.063
because I already know how
great you're gonna do.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.265
Eat the pie!

12:48.234 --> 12:49.534
Pinkie, look out!

12:49.636 --> 12:52.304
I'm not going to fall for-- AH!

12:53.206 --> 12:54.139
Whoa!

13:00.379 --> 13:02.047
Pinkie! Are you OK!?

13:02.549 --> 13:04.649
[struggling] Get me down!

13:04.851 --> 13:07.018
Sorry Ma'am but we have to make
sure you didn't sustain

13:07.120 --> 13:08.488
any internal injuries.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.857
But the pie, what
happened to the pie?

13:12.059 --> 13:16.160
Oh.. The pie was delicious.
You just get better!

13:16.896 --> 13:18.763
NOOOOO!

13:21.568 --> 13:24.469
Ah! Somepony help me!

13:25.905 --> 13:28.606
Rainbow Dash, thank
goodness you're here!

13:28.908 --> 13:30.842
I was trying to fix the top
pie on my pie pyramid

13:30.944 --> 13:32.911
but the whole thing
became unstable.

13:33.013 --> 13:38.683
And there's only one way to save
me: you have to eat the pies!

13:38.885 --> 13:40.651
Don't worry, I got ya!

13:43.422 --> 13:44.222
Oh, right.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.791
Or you could save me that way.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.593
You gotta be more
careful, OK?

13:50.462 --> 13:52.263
Grrrr!

13:57.669 --> 13:58.637
Rainbow Dash!

13:58.839 --> 14:01.506
I wanted to thank you for
saving me from the pie pyramid,

14:01.608 --> 14:03.041
so have a pie.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.142
Have three!

14:04.444 --> 14:05.310
Have fifteen!

14:05.412 --> 14:08.313
I<i> know</i> how much you love them!

14:08.815 --> 14:10.215
Now eat up!

14:10.517 --> 14:11.249
Uh...

14:11.551 --> 14:12.218
Thanks!

14:13.820 --> 14:17.589
I can't wait to
eat ALL THESE PIES!

14:22.662 --> 14:24.529
What? Where did they--
How did you--

14:25.131 --> 14:26.431
Delicious!

14:26.533 --> 14:28.366
You did it again, Pinkie.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.108
Rainbow Dash, there you are!

14:37.210 --> 14:38.343
I made a pie for everypony

14:38.445 --> 14:40.245
and you're the only one who
hasn't eaten hers yet.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.247
So here. Your pie.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.849
For you to eat. Now!

14:44.551 --> 14:46.051
Are you OK?

14:46.353 --> 14:48.920
You seem to be staring
more than usual.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.590
I just REALLY like to watch
others enjoy my pies.

14:55.695 --> 14:59.030
You sure you don't
have to blink?

14:59.332 --> 15:02.467
Me? Nope, I'm not
much of a blinker.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.738
Don't mind me, go
ahead and take a bite.

15:07.140 --> 15:13.144
Well..... do I want to take a
big bite or a small bite?

15:13.646 --> 15:15.714
I just don't know.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.516
Or maybe medium.

15:18.753 --> 15:21.252
No, no, no.
Definitely NOT medium.

15:23.522 --> 15:24.522
Just try some!

15:25.746 --> 15:27.146
Ahhh..

15:27.861 --> 15:31.862
Ah...  Do you have any.... milk?

15:48.715 --> 15:49.948
Ah, never mind.

15:49.950 --> 15:53.018
Your pies are just
too good to resist.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.319
What?
No!

15:54.521 --> 15:55.186
NO!

15:55.488 --> 15:56.655
That's it!

15:56.857 --> 15:58.590
I can't take it!

15:58.992 --> 16:00.825
Uh. Everything OK, Pinkie?

16:00.927 --> 16:03.628
No, everything is NOT OK!

16:03.730 --> 16:06.030
YOU HATE MY PIES!

16:08.267 --> 16:09.935
What are you
talking about?

16:10.337 --> 16:12.270
You know exactly what
I'm talking about!

16:12.472 --> 16:13.438
I saw what you did.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.673
Well, I didn't
SEE what you did,

16:14.675 --> 16:16.575
but I know that you've
been fake eating my pies!

16:16.877 --> 16:18.410
You threw away the pie I
made for your seventy-third

16:18.512 --> 16:21.012
Wonderbolt training session and
I know you SECRETLY somehow got

16:21.114 --> 16:22.581
rid of all the other
pies I gave you!

16:22.683 --> 16:23.782
ADMIT IT!

16:24.284 --> 16:26.117
That's crazy!

16:26.219 --> 16:27.318
What do you think I did,

16:27.420 --> 16:30.388
somehow make them all
disappear into thin air?

16:32.559 --> 16:33.092
Heh heh.

16:33.194 --> 16:38.596
OK, so maybe I made one of
them disappear into thin air.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.837
HOW COULD YOU?

16:47.139 --> 16:51.709
What!? I, um, I-I just wanted to
share these amazing pies

16:51.811 --> 16:53.344
with the folks of Cloudsdale.

16:53.446 --> 16:57.582
So I uh, I was trying to send
them up via balloon mail.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.451
But you just said
they were delicious.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.253
Well, obviously
that's because...

17:02.855 --> 17:04.122
I have amnesia!

17:05.524 --> 17:06.624
I've been brainwashed!

17:07.793 --> 17:10.161
It's.... opposite day?

17:10.563 --> 17:12.230
Your memory's working
fine, you hate washing

17:12.332 --> 17:13.665
and I know today's
not Opposite Day

17:13.767 --> 17:15.567
because I bake you a
pie for it every year.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.702
A pie that you probably
just throw away.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.003
Or give to charity.

17:19.105 --> 17:22.440
Or destroy with your laser
eyes while laughing at me!

17:22.942 --> 17:24.209
Laser eyes?

17:24.611 --> 17:26.478
Oh, oh! So you admit it.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.648
What? No! I can explain.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.316
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!

17:37.890 --> 17:41.560
She won't listen to me; she
won't let me apologize.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.863
[sigh] I feel terrible.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.231
Well, you have
been lying to her.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.067
To all of us, actually.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.870
Yeah, is there anything else
you're lying about

17:52.972 --> 17:54.205
that we should know?

17:54.407 --> 17:55.106
No!

17:55.508 --> 17:58.844
Well, not that I can think
of off the top of my head.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.780
Is it MY fault that
I don't like pies?

18:02.882 --> 18:05.984
And not just Pinkie's
pies, all pies.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.486
I know how much she
loves making pies

18:08.588 --> 18:11.956
and if I told her I didn't like
them, it would have crushed her.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.093
Uh. You kinda
crushed her anyway.

18:15.395 --> 18:19.197
Oh- But I- You're right.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.801
I guess I should've just eaten
the pies in the first place.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.336
[gasp] Wait, that's it!

18:25.538 --> 18:27.705
I know how I can
make it up to her!

18:31.843 --> 18:35.145
Pee-yew! Gummy
is that you?

18:36.249 --> 18:37.448
Huh. What is that?

18:38.984 --> 18:41.185
Oh, it's<i> you</i>.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.621
Pinkie Pie, wait.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.591
I know now that I should've been
honest with you from the start

18:46.693 --> 18:48.827
because lying to your
friends is wrong.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.497
And because getting rid of all
those pies was a giant hassle.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.032
I mean, do you have any
idea how many pies

18:55.134 --> 18:56.667
you've made for me
over the years?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.170
Yes, I know exactly how many.

18:59.272 --> 19:02.340
I have a very detailed
pie-ling system.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.308
Of course you do.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.211
The point is, I thought
the hassle was worth it

19:07.313 --> 19:09.948
just to spare your feelings,
but I was wrong.

19:10.250 --> 19:14.151
So to make up for it, I
made this pie for you.

19:16.288 --> 19:17.955
Well, I guess I made it for me.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.090
To eat in front of you.

19:19.192 --> 19:23.027
Point is, I'm eating
this pie for friendship!

19:23.329 --> 19:27.765
Wait, that smelly circular
monstrosity is a pie?

19:27.967 --> 19:28.567
Yeah!

19:29.069 --> 19:31.336
I know I can't go back and eat
all the pies you made for me

19:31.438 --> 19:33.504
in the past, so instead

19:33.606 --> 19:35.940
I'm going to eat this
giant one for you now.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.477
So.. here I go!

19:42.672 --> 19:43.949
Ahh......

19:44.150 --> 19:45.983
Wait! I can't watch you do this.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.490
I mean, is that crust or
some kind of concrete?

19:52.592 --> 19:54.725
Yeah, honestly, I have no idea.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.460
Oh, I can't believe
you're willing to eat

19:56.562 --> 19:58.062
this terrible pie for me.

19:58.264 --> 20:01.766
It's ridiculous and this whole
thing is overly complicated and...

20:02.268 --> 20:05.870
[sigh] I think I finally
understand why you lied.

20:06.472 --> 20:07.805
Whoa, what's that?

20:09.174 --> 20:11.042
Huh. Guess it was nothing.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.744
I'm so glad you enjoy my pies!

20:16.081 --> 20:17.482
Oh, never mind.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.951
Great pies!

20:20.253 --> 20:21.719
EEEEEE!

20:22.321 --> 20:23.721
No way, check that out!

20:25.223 --> 20:27.959
A-ha! It's not even my birthday!

20:28.461 --> 20:30.996
Oh, sorry, guess it was nothing.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.999
Mm. But that custard was everything!

20:35.301 --> 20:38.135
Seeing you eat my pies makes
me the happiest pony

20:38.237 --> 20:40.772
in all of Equestria!

20:40.874 --> 20:43.175
Heh. I know it does.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.745
You did a lot of ridiculous and
overly complex things to get rid

20:47.847 --> 20:51.516
of my pies because it made
you happy to see me happy.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.385
Just like I went to a lot of
effort to make you the pies

20:54.487 --> 20:57.555
because it made me
happy to see you happy.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.723
Yes!

20:58.825 --> 21:01.092
And if you're willing to
go through all of that,

21:01.194 --> 21:05.130
it really shows how much you're
willing to do for your friends.

21:05.332 --> 21:08.366
Heh. Aw shucks, it was nothing.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.235
Now get out of that
thing and give me a hug!

21:13.004 --> 21:17.375
Just remember, in the future you
can always be honest with me.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.710
Uh. I could've told her that.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.713
Cool...

21:22.815 --> 21:26.884
How 'bout this: Your
hugs are too tight. Heh heh.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.152
Ha ha ha ha!

21:28.254 --> 21:28.953
Ha ha ha!

21:29.355 --> 21:30.189
No they're not.
