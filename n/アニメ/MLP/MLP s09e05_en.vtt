WEBVTT

00:05.172 --> 00:05.838
Whoa!

00:07.641 --> 00:09.408
Twilight! Mail's here!

00:14.382 --> 00:15.647
Are you all right?

00:17.251 --> 00:20.987
We just had a really
heavy delivery today.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.455
Is it a deluxe set of Special
Edition Ogres & Oubliettes

00:23.557 --> 00:25.057
figurines that I'm
totally surprised by

00:25.159 --> 00:26.826
and haven't been hinting
that I need forever!?

00:27.228 --> 00:30.029
Well... it's
for Twilight.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.430
Awww.

00:31.732 --> 00:32.532
Thank you!

00:33.034 --> 00:34.533
You're welcome!

00:34.735 --> 00:36.969
Huh, it's from
Princess Celestia.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.639
So's this. Really?

00:40.741 --> 00:42.408
She couldn't have
put it into the box?

00:43.310 --> 00:45.511
"My Dearest Twilight.
I have been conducting

00:45.613 --> 00:47.279
a thorough cleaning
of the castle,

00:47.381 --> 00:50.382
and I came across a few items
of yours in your old room.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.284
I thought you might
want them back."

00:52.386 --> 00:54.319
I didn't even know
I'd left anything!

00:55.789 --> 00:56.989
Aw, look!

00:57.091 --> 00:59.825
Remember this? It's the
macaroni picture frame

00:59.927 --> 01:01.994
Cadance helped me make
when I was a filly!

01:04.532 --> 01:06.732
Who could forget a
masterpiece like that?

01:08.102 --> 01:10.135
My G1 Starswirl figure!

01:10.237 --> 01:12.438
And some of my favorite
school scrolls!

01:13.040 --> 01:15.407
And here's my extra,
extra credit report

01:15.509 --> 01:18.844
on "The Impediments of Using
Magic in Everyday Chores"!

01:20.114 --> 01:22.181
Ha! Still so true!

01:22.483 --> 01:24.283
Is my Smash Fortune
comic in there?

01:24.385 --> 01:25.917
I've been looking
for that for years!

01:26.019 --> 01:26.552
Agh!

01:29.256 --> 01:30.122
Hold this.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.558
Oh, no, oh no, oh no!

01:33.160 --> 01:35.728
What's wrong? It just looks
like an old library book.

01:36.030 --> 01:39.231
Exactly! It belongs to
the Canterlot Library.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.432
That means it's...

01:43.737 --> 01:44.870
... OVERDUE!

02:25.279 --> 02:26.745
You don't understand, Spike!

02:26.947 --> 02:29.448
I have a perfect library
book-return record!

02:29.584 --> 02:31.984
Ahem. <i>Had</i> a perfect record.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.788
[groan] I've never turned in a
book even a minute late!

02:36.190 --> 02:37.322
And this one...

02:37.424 --> 02:40.425
has been overdue since
I left for Ponyville!

02:56.110 --> 02:58.610
Make sure you bring
this one back on time.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.979
We've got a long
waiting list of ponies

03:01.081 --> 03:02.714
who can't wait to read it!

03:03.116 --> 03:05.284
I promise I won't
let you down!

03:05.586 --> 03:07.819
Oh. Of course you
won't, dear.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.989
If there's anypony I can
trust to take care of a book,

03:11.091 --> 03:13.225
it's you, Twilight Sparkle!

03:13.527 --> 03:17.996
After all, you still hold the
"Best Book Borrower" title.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.634
Ooh! I hope I do forever!

03:24.271 --> 03:27.906
Spike! Quick! Find
me that old copy of

03:28.008 --> 03:31.076
"Predictions and Prophecies".
What's that for?

03:32.346 --> 03:35.314
Well, it was a gift
for Moondancer but...

03:36.417 --> 03:37.383
Oh, Spike.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.750
You know we don't have time
for that sort of thing.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.655
And then Celestia
sent me to Ponyville

03:43.757 --> 03:45.257
and I forgot
all about this!

03:45.559 --> 03:48.260
Dusty Pages prided herself
that no books were damaged

03:48.362 --> 03:49.728
or lost on her watch.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.865
And I failed her!
I've failed MYSELF!

03:53.267 --> 03:54.967
I take it we're
going to Canterlot?

03:57.805 --> 04:00.806
[sigh] The sooner the
better, I guess.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.119
Uh, why are we hiding?

04:14.221 --> 04:15.954
Don't you want to
return your book?

04:16.056 --> 04:18.623
Yes, but what if somepony
sees me in there?

04:18.725 --> 04:20.192
I'm the Princess
of Friendship.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.427
Everywhere I go,
ponies recognize me.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.229
I'll stick out
like a sore hoof!

04:24.531 --> 04:28.700
Princess Twilight Sparkle in
a library? Stop the presses!

04:28.902 --> 04:30.869
A late book is a
big deal, Spike!

04:31.171 --> 04:33.705
What if Dusty Pages
revokes my library card?

04:35.576 --> 04:37.976
Or bans me from ever
entering the building again!?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.046
Don't you already have
most of those books

04:41.148 --> 04:42.314
in your collection at home?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.716
Yes, but the ones in
there have a special

04:44.818 --> 04:46.919
Canterlot Library-y smell!

04:47.221 --> 04:48.320
You sniff books?

04:48.522 --> 04:49.488
You don't?

04:52.793 --> 04:55.861
I used to LIVE in a library!
If I'm not a good example

04:55.963 --> 04:57.863
of proper book-borrowing
behavior,

04:57.965 --> 04:59.965
then what kind of
princess am I?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.968
One that makes mistakes
like everypony else.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.705
Trust me, once you return that
book, you'll feel way better.

05:07.107 --> 05:07.973
Thanks, Spike.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.307
Let's go.

05:09.509 --> 05:10.175
Agh!

05:27.995 --> 05:30.462
[disguised voice]
Ahem. I have a book to return.

05:30.764 --> 05:34.534
Princess Twilight!
So good to see you!

05:36.587 --> 05:39.237
Need some recommendations
from the new release section?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.607
[gasp] Is that the
new edition of

05:41.709 --> 05:44.109
"Mooncurve's Seven
Theories on Bending Time"?

05:44.211 --> 05:45.810
I have been waiting
for the release since--

05:47.348 --> 05:50.682
Uhh I mean, uh, no
books today, thanks.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.487
But I do need to speak with
Dusty Pages about a... [ahem]

05:55.989 --> 05:57.389
sensitive matter.

05:57.791 --> 05:58.724
Dusty who?

06:00.227 --> 06:02.361
Dusty Pages! The head librarian?

06:02.463 --> 06:03.862
She's worked here forever.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.267
I'm sorry, Princess.
I don't know her.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.369
Now, was there some
other way I can help

06:10.471 --> 06:12.871
the Library's Best
Book Borrower?

06:17.110 --> 06:19.311
Just ask her where to
return an overdue book.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.780
It's no big deal. It
happens all the time!

06:21.982 --> 06:23.215
Not to me, it doesn't!

06:25.486 --> 06:27.019
[sigh] Fine.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.555
Fine! Oh, no. I didn't even
think about the late fine!

06:30.657 --> 06:32.023
A book out this long
will probably cost

06:32.125 --> 06:33.291
a thousand bits!

06:35.228 --> 06:38.630
She--I mean <i>we</i>, have
an overdue book.

06:39.032 --> 06:42.033
Oh! Well, that's no
problem at all.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.469
In fact, it happens
all the time!

06:45.238 --> 06:46.037
See?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.408
I'll just find it
in the card catalog.

06:49.810 --> 06:53.245
Er.. Number one-eight-nine-oh-five. Got it!

06:54.147 --> 06:56.448
Ohhhhh, wow. Eeeesh.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.785
I haven't seen a book
this late in, well, ever.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.788
Ahem. You need to go and
see First Folio

07:02.890 --> 07:05.490
in the "Grossly Overdue
Book Return Office

07:05.592 --> 07:08.060
for Ponies Who
Should Know Better."

07:08.362 --> 07:10.929
Don't pull any punches
with those names, do ya?

07:11.999 --> 07:13.799
And that office would be...?

07:14.201 --> 07:17.502
In the basement.
[whispers] Because of the SHAME.

07:24.144 --> 07:28.146
Whoa. Ugh. Looks like nopony
ever goes down here.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.615
Nopony except
undependable rule breakers

07:30.717 --> 07:33.151
who deserve all the
horrors this hallway holds.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.621
And their faithful
dragon companions.

07:36.023 --> 07:39.724
Uh. Hey, looks like First Folio
left a note on the door.

07:39.826 --> 07:41.760
Abandon hope all
ye who enter?

07:42.863 --> 07:45.130
"Out to lunch on
Restaurant Row."

07:45.232 --> 07:46.865
Guess we'll have
to try back later.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.535
Oh, no! I can't wait another
minute to return this book!

07:50.637 --> 07:51.803
In the time it took
us to get there,

07:51.905 --> 07:53.005
I racked up another--

07:54.508 --> 07:56.508
Seventeen bits in late fees!

07:56.910 --> 07:57.809
We're going to lunch!

07:58.211 --> 07:59.811
Good, cause I'm starving!

08:02.516 --> 08:04.717
Oh. You mean to
find First Folio.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.018
Can we at least
get take-out?

08:09.690 --> 08:12.123
Tell me if you see any
librarian-type ponies.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.392
Twilight, we've
tried this

08:13.494 --> 08:15.527
at three other
restaurants already.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.262
And my late fines
are already up

08:17.364 --> 08:19.064
another 26 more bits!

08:22.102 --> 08:24.203
Waiter, we're
ready to order.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.804
Oh, I'm not actually a---

08:25.906 --> 08:28.173
Three samosas, two
curry specials...

08:28.275 --> 08:30.042
Do you think that's
enough for the two of us?

08:30.244 --> 08:34.379
Hm. I would probably order some
Naan as well? For the table.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.714
Sounds great!

08:36.216 --> 08:38.317
Twilight? Is that you?

08:38.519 --> 08:40.552
Moondancer! How
have you been?

08:41.054 --> 08:44.255
I'm just visiting.
No real reason. Heh.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.992
Well, it's good to see you!
I'm just meeting my friend,

08:47.094 --> 08:49.594
First Folio, for lunch.
Do you want to join us?

08:49.996 --> 08:52.764
First Folio!? YES!
I mean, thank you.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.435
Princess Twilight!
Good to meet you!

08:56.537 --> 08:59.671
Did you know your picture
is still up in our library

08:59.773 --> 09:01.906
as the Best Book Borrower.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.025
Yeeeeah.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.743
I was hoping I could talk
to Dusty Pages about that.

09:05.946 --> 09:09.514
Oh, Dusty Pages left
the library moons ago.

09:09.616 --> 09:10.482
Didn't you know?

09:10.884 --> 09:11.616
Mm mm.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.886
Oh, I heard she was
forced to leave.

09:15.188 --> 09:18.890
It's so sad. She
loved the library.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.226
Wait. <i>Forced</i> to leave?

09:21.528 --> 09:25.497
Uh huh, yeah. She had a
perfect librarian record,

09:25.599 --> 09:28.967
until one careless pony
didn't return a book.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.402
Ruined it all.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.904
Are you OK, Twilight?

09:33.874 --> 09:36.841
Uh huh... Would...
you excuse me?

09:39.913 --> 09:42.780
That's why you only order
spicy if you can take it.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.350
Twilight, what's wrong?

09:45.552 --> 09:47.852
Dusty Pages isn't working
at the library anymore

09:47.954 --> 09:49.754
because I didn't
return this book!

09:50.056 --> 09:53.424
Spike! I think I got her FIRED!

09:58.832 --> 10:01.567
Twilight! The
library is that way!

10:02.469 --> 10:05.103
Change of plans! We're
going to Dusty's house.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.806
She used to invite me
over for tea all the time.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.608
But what about your late fees?

10:09.810 --> 10:12.210
They're not as important
as making things right.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.847
Wait, so you're not
going to return the book?

10:15.649 --> 10:19.751
No. Dusty Pages is! It's
my fault she lost her job.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.655
So if I give her the book,
she can get her old job back!

10:23.757 --> 10:25.190
It'll fix everything!

10:33.266 --> 10:34.699
Didn't ya see the sign?

10:35.702 --> 10:38.337
"No Salesponies"!

10:38.639 --> 10:40.939
Oh, I'm not
selling anything!

10:41.041 --> 10:42.674
No carolers either.

10:42.776 --> 10:46.811
No surveys, no petitions,
no free literature--

10:51.652 --> 10:52.485
No problem!

10:52.586 --> 10:54.819
I'm just looking for somepony
who used to live here.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.955
I'm pretty sure
this was her house.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.656
Dusty Pages?

10:58.858 --> 10:59.557
Yes!

10:59.759 --> 11:00.725
Hold on.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.664
She moved to Silver somethin'.

11:05.866 --> 11:09.000
Shoals? Seas? Surfer? Whatever.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.035
When you find her,
give her this.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.141
It's been stackin' up
for years.

11:16.243 --> 11:19.543
And tell her to
CHANGE. HER. ADDRESS!

12:06.860 --> 12:10.095
"Silverstable Community..
for the best Golden Years."

12:10.297 --> 12:11.696
This HAS to be it!

12:11.898 --> 12:13.365
I hope so.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.901
It's the last "Silver" spot
on the map we haven't looked.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.542
Whoa! This place is--

12:24.644 --> 12:26.077
Terrible, I know!

12:26.279 --> 12:28.480
There's not a single
bookshelf in sight.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.549
Poor Dusty.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.350
Excuse me.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.553
Yes. How may I help you?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.256
Do you have a resident
named Dusty Pages?

12:37.758 --> 12:40.858
Oh, yes! Her apartment
is in the next complex.

12:40.960 --> 12:41.826
Ground floor.

12:42.763 --> 12:43.828
Thank you!

12:47.834 --> 12:50.702
I can't believe that my
carelessness sent her here

12:50.904 --> 12:52.370
when she could be
happily surrounded

12:52.472 --> 12:54.940
by millions of
wonderful-smelling books!

12:55.242 --> 12:58.043
You realize that might just
be a "you" thing, right?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.614
[gasp]
There she is! Here we go.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.830
Aarrgghh!

13:19.032 --> 13:20.431
She's bound to
be back soon.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.300
Maybe we should just wait here.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.569
No. We are
fixing this... NOW!

13:24.671 --> 13:27.238
This place isn't that
big. We can find her!

13:31.945 --> 13:34.112
Sorry to interrupt your
plein air painting,

13:34.314 --> 13:37.148
but we're looking for Dusty
Pages. Have you seen her?

13:37.350 --> 13:38.616
Sure have.

13:43.389 --> 13:44.722
And...?

13:46.059 --> 13:48.393
She had to leave
early to get to her

13:48.695 --> 13:50.795
fengbi de ti session.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.597
Which is right
before she leads

13:52.699 --> 13:54.499
the woodworking
class with me.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.868
Then she's on
to windsurfing!

13:56.970 --> 14:00.004
Ooh! And don't forget theatre rehearsal!

14:00.206 --> 14:04.175
Dusty's playing the
lead role... again.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.345
Then there's her
band practice later.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.379
Thank you!

14:09.883 --> 14:12.784
Wow, Dusty sounds
like one busy pony.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.420
Oooh! She's just filling her
days with distractions

14:15.522 --> 14:18.523
to cover the pain of
losing the best job ever!

14:18.725 --> 14:20.125
But not for long!

15:22.255 --> 15:25.090
DUSTY PAGES! Finally!
C'mon, Spike.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.726
Wait! She looks
pretty happy up there.

15:33.165 --> 15:34.866
Trust me, it's
all an act.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.001
She'll be a lot happier
when I deliver the good news

15:37.103 --> 15:39.570
that she can go back to
working at the library!

15:42.509 --> 15:44.309
Care to take five, everypony?

15:44.711 --> 15:48.412
Oh! Twilight Sparkle? My stars!

15:49.649 --> 15:51.649
It's so wonderful to see you!

15:51.751 --> 15:53.218
What are you
doing here?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.854
I've been looking all
over Equestria for you!

15:56.156 --> 15:57.589
I need to tell
you something.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.192
You brought my
mail! Oh, thank you!

16:02.896 --> 16:06.965
No. I mean, yes, we did, but
that's not why we're here.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.233
I let you down.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.969
And I can't forgive myself
until I set things right.

16:11.371 --> 16:14.205
I don't remember you
doing anything wrong.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.941
You told me to take special
care of a book I checked out

16:17.043 --> 16:20.211
from the Canterlot library.
And I never brought it back!

16:20.313 --> 16:22.881
[gasp] It was YOU that
had that book out?

16:23.083 --> 16:25.650
The one that broke
my perfect record?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.720
But now you can bring
it to Canterlot Library

16:29.922 --> 16:31.323
and get your job back!

16:32.125 --> 16:33.124
No thank you!

16:33.226 --> 16:35.927
I don't ever need to
see that library again.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.530
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have somewhere to be!

16:48.541 --> 16:49.540
Do you mind?

16:54.547 --> 16:55.747
I don't understand.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.249
If Dusty Pages won't go
back to Canterlot Library

16:58.351 --> 16:59.317
and explain everything,

16:59.419 --> 17:01.219
then she won't be able
to get her job back.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.889
Even worse, her record
will remain... imperfect!

17:05.091 --> 17:06.958
And yours will, too?

17:07.260 --> 17:10.027
Well. Yeah! But that
doesn't matter anymore.

17:10.129 --> 17:10.862
Really?

17:10.964 --> 17:13.531
Well, maybe a little
bit. Oh, no... BITS!

17:13.633 --> 17:16.067
The late fines! How
much do I owe now?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.541
Uh... You don't want to know.

17:24.427 --> 17:26.510
It would have been worth
all the bits in Equestria

17:26.613 --> 17:28.546
if I'd made things
right with Dusty.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.748
I wish I knew why
she won't go back.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.417
Why don't you ask her?

17:32.519 --> 17:34.285
She didn't seem
to want to talk.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.720
You surprised her.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.956
And she probably had something
else on her schedule.

17:38.058 --> 17:42.493
That thing is PACKED. C'mon,
what've you got to lose?

17:42.795 --> 17:45.330
Now that I've messed
up this much. Nothing.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.999
You're right, Spike.
It's worth a try.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.068
Where do you think she
went? Crochet, bingo...

17:52.405 --> 17:55.273
A squishy fruit
foodfight tournament!?

17:58.144 --> 17:59.944
Hey, everypony! We come in--

18:01.214 --> 18:02.280
...er pieces.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.556
Stop! We just wanna talk to
Dusty Pages for a moment!

18:12.858 --> 18:14.091
Please?

18:14.193 --> 18:16.894
TIME OUT!

18:18.631 --> 18:19.430
Oof!

18:19.732 --> 18:21.933
Next time, you should rent gear!

18:22.235 --> 18:24.168
We're not actually
here for the game.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.104
I.. was hoping you'd
give me another chance

18:26.206 --> 18:28.039
to talk to you about
the library book.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.176
This really means a
lot to you, doesn't it?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.912
Mm hm. I know I
ruined your life

18:35.014 --> 18:36.814
by not returning
my book on time.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.684
And I will do anything I
can to make it up to you.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.687
Even promise to never take a
book out of the library again,

18:42.989 --> 18:44.088
if that's what it takes.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.829
That.. is not the
reaction we expected.

18:51.131 --> 18:54.532
Twilight, dear. You've
got it all backwards!

18:54.634 --> 18:56.501
I'm not upset with you.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.936
You're not?

18:58.238 --> 19:01.806
No! If I'm mad at
anypony, it's me.

19:07.113 --> 19:10.715
All those years I spent
hiding away in that library,

19:10.917 --> 19:12.617
trying to be perfect...

19:12.919 --> 19:14.452
When your book never came in,

19:14.554 --> 19:17.722
I felt something.. exhilarating!

19:18.124 --> 19:19.056
What was it?

19:19.358 --> 19:20.125
Freedom!

19:20.727 --> 19:21.726
From books?

19:22.128 --> 19:23.661
From perfection!

19:23.963 --> 19:26.531
I was too stubborn to know
when to call it quits.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.167
It took your mistake
to make me realize

19:29.269 --> 19:31.903
that I wasn't living
the life I wanted!

19:32.205 --> 19:33.971
You mean you weren't fired?

19:34.073 --> 19:37.275
You left the library
because you wanted to?

19:37.477 --> 19:40.545
Twilight, your late
book was the best thing

19:40.647 --> 19:42.346
that ever happened to me!

19:42.448 --> 19:45.383
Now, I'm not afraid to try
things I might fail at.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.351
In fact, sometimes messing up

19:47.453 --> 19:49.287
teaches me more than
getting it right!

19:49.789 --> 19:51.122
You're sure you don't
want to return it

19:51.224 --> 19:52.657
and get that
perfect record back?

19:53.760 --> 19:54.759
Agh!

19:55.361 --> 19:58.062
Oh, good. It was
a yellow one.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.931
You can still
see the words!

20:00.333 --> 20:01.566
But it'll have a stain!

20:01.668 --> 20:04.135
That doesn't change
the truth inside it.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.138
Wait. Did you even
read that thing?

20:07.840 --> 20:11.309
Actually, er... no.
I guess I didn't.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.545
"PERFECTION."

20:14.847 --> 20:16.547
And the next part...

20:18.384 --> 20:20.384
"The Impossible Pursuit."

20:24.090 --> 20:27.091
Oh. That might've been
useful to look at earlier...

20:30.797 --> 20:35.199
Hm. Your total late fees come to...

20:35.301 --> 20:37.468
However much it
is, I'll cover it!

20:37.670 --> 20:39.738
Uh, do you have a
monthly payment plan?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.839
...twenty-eight bits.

20:43.042 --> 20:43.976
That's it!?

20:44.277 --> 20:47.611
Yeah. Most ponies don't
know it caps at a month.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.147
Probably because
we don't tell them.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.720
Thank you! Your
account is back to normal.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.455
Although we will be taking down

20:57.557 --> 21:00.024
your Best Book Borrower picture...

21:00.326 --> 21:02.960
Um, is that really necessary?

21:03.262 --> 21:05.296
It just seems so.. permanent.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.998
I mean, I did return
the book, after all.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.167
Ahem.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.136
OK. Letting the perfection go...

21:12.738 --> 21:14.472
You want me to
reshelf this for you?

21:14.674 --> 21:16.574
Nope. It's an old edition.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.344
We've already replaced
it with a new copy.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.746
In that case, can we keep it?

21:21.848 --> 21:24.148
It might be a good
reminder to have around.

21:25.184 --> 21:28.019
You're sure? It's got a stain...

21:28.321 --> 21:30.721
That's what makes it perfect.
