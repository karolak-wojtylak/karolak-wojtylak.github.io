00:02.302 --> 00:04.536
I know how hard you've
been working lately,

00:04.638 --> 00:06.338
so I figured you
could use a break.

00:08.108 --> 00:10.075
Trixie, this looks amazing!

00:10.177 --> 00:12.511
But my job doesn't
really seem like work...

00:14.147 --> 00:15.447
Ooh! Speaking of...

00:27.061 --> 00:29.094
Sure, being counselor
for the students

00:29.196 --> 00:31.763
at Twilight's School of
Friendship is demanding,

00:31.865 --> 00:33.698
but... [chimes] Oh, one sec.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.973
What was I saying? Oh, right.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.809
Being able to use
the experiences

00:43.911 --> 00:46.478
of my checkered past
to help young students

00:46.580 --> 00:51.184
feels pretty great.
Oooh! Yum! Mm. Thanks.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.286
Of course, I feel
nothing but admiration

00:54.388 --> 00:57.422
for the work you do, but it
is a little all-consuming

00:57.624 --> 00:59.858
and I miss spending
time with you.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.326
What are you
talking about!?

01:01.528 --> 01:03.595
We're spending
time right now.

01:03.697 --> 01:04.496
Well...

01:07.734 --> 01:09.233
Hold that thought!
[poof]

01:09.636 --> 01:10.602
Grrr!

01:12.374 --> 01:15.874
[poof] Hah! Sorry. I cast a spell
on the door to my office

01:15.976 --> 01:18.310
so this bracelet goes off
whenever there's a knock.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.446
Yona is having the worst
time with her braids lately.

01:23.316 --> 01:24.750
Anyway, you were saying?

02:08.929 --> 02:10.596
♪♪

02:10.698 --> 02:13.031
I totally respect my
younger cousins' decisions

02:13.133 --> 02:14.333
to stay seaponies,

02:14.435 --> 02:16.302
but they've never
been on dry land.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.504
Preparing for a visit with
them is almost as much work

02:18.606 --> 02:20.506
as the research assignment
Headmare Twilight gave me

02:20.608 --> 02:23.075
on Hazardous Fauna of
the Everfree Forest!

How would <i>you</i> describe
a shower to creatures

02:25.446 --> 02:26.712
who live in water?

02:26.814 --> 02:28.547
So far, I've got
warm and steamy.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.682
Actually, steam
has water in it...

02:30.784 --> 02:33.352
Silverstream, there
are a lot of students

02:33.454 --> 02:34.853
who want to see me today.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.888
I just need a few
shower adjectives

that don't rely
on the wet part.

[sigh] Well, there's
clean, relaxing, um...

02:43.297 --> 02:47.099
Relaxing? I don't know.
A nap's relaxing too.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.801
Warm and clean are OK.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.537
Wow. I have to give
this some more thought!

02:52.039 --> 02:55.843
Oh. OK. Well, I'm here to
help. My door's always open!

02:57.745 --> 02:59.778
Except for today, of course.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.016
If we leave now, we
can finish everything

03:04.118 --> 03:05.084
before sundown!

03:05.286 --> 03:08.921
Trixie, I can't leave!
It's almost Spring Break.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.191
Twilight and the others
have already left

03:12.293 --> 03:14.426
to celebrate the Spring
Solstice in Canterlot

03:14.528 --> 03:16.695
and I have to help the
students with any issues

03:16.797 --> 03:18.730
before they head
home for the holiday!

03:23.270 --> 03:25.571
I know you're busy, but I
hope you haven't forgotten

03:25.673 --> 03:27.773
about the Spring Sols-tastic!

03:30.377 --> 03:32.577
The party Maud and
Mudbriar are throwing?

03:34.114 --> 03:35.881
Sunburst is coming to town?

03:37.685 --> 03:40.453
You and I promised
to make the cake..?

03:41.155 --> 03:44.623
Oh PFFFT! How could I possibly
forget about that..!

03:55.502 --> 03:57.636
Nopony is saying your
job isn't important,

03:57.738 --> 04:00.372
but plans you make with your
friends are important too!

04:00.774 --> 04:04.676
[sigh] I know. I'm sorry. I
shouldn't have forgotten.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.146
Obviously, I need to be
available to my students,

04:07.248 --> 04:09.248
BUT! That doesn't
mean I can't help

04:09.350 --> 04:11.316
with all the things
we have to do.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.051
Good!

04:12.653 --> 04:13.286
Great!

04:14.388 --> 04:18.825
So... what <i>are</i> all the
things we have to do?

04:18.949 --> 04:19.626
Hmph!

04:19.927 --> 04:22.027
Maud needs streamers
for the decorations.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.896
Sunburst wants us to pick up
a genuine, pre-Equestrian,

04:24.998 --> 04:27.499
Spring Solstice chafing
dish from the antique shop.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.501
Of course he does.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.270
Mudbriar wants a "bouquet
of flowering sticks,"

04:31.372 --> 04:32.122
whatever that means.

04:32.223 --> 04:34.673
And I thought we were BOTH
looking forward to Mrs. Cake

04:34.775 --> 04:36.075
teaching us the secret recipe

04:36.177 --> 04:37.910
to her famous Spring
Solstice cake.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.045
Oh! I totally am!

04:41.515 --> 04:45.518
But.. we could just buy
a cake from her, right?

04:46.020 --> 04:50.822
We could, but then we'd
miss out on baking <i>together</i>.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.392
Plus the time I spent
flattering and convincing

04:53.494 --> 04:56.361
and begging her to share the
recipe would be for NOTHING,

04:56.463 --> 04:59.398
and we promised to MAKE
a cake, not BUY a cake

04:59.500 --> 05:02.702
and the great and powerful
Trixie keeps her promises!!

05:03.304 --> 05:07.239
OK! Why don't we just
split up these jobs?

05:07.441 --> 05:09.574
I'll get the streamers
and the chafing dish.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.811
You ... [chiming] get
started on those sticks

05:12.913 --> 05:13.812
and I'll be right back!

05:18.652 --> 05:21.286
You know, why don't I
just hang onto this?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.522
Wouldn't want to forget
the things I just said

05:23.624 --> 05:24.724
I'd take care of...

05:25.026 --> 05:27.626
because I am TOTALLY going
to take care of them!

05:32.666 --> 05:34.499
Could it be plum blossom?

05:34.701 --> 05:35.800
I have no idea.

05:36.002 --> 05:36.802
[poof] Wha!

05:36.904 --> 05:39.671
Whoops! Sorry Rose,
but I need a bouquet

05:39.773 --> 05:41.640
of flowering sticks, STAT!

05:41.742 --> 05:44.143
I thought I was getting
the flowering sticks.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.746
Uh, I'm still not exactly
sure what they are...

05:47.948 --> 05:48.680
No one is!

05:49.282 --> 05:50.382
Right. Got it.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.150
You get the sticks;
I'll get the streamers...

05:53.754 --> 05:55.587
right after I take
care of what I am sure

05:55.689 --> 05:58.189
is an even smaller student
problem than the last one!

05:58.391 --> 05:59.590
Ha ha!
[poof]

06:07.868 --> 06:10.335
I think I have the shower
thing under control,

06:10.437 --> 06:12.737
but I can't figure out
how to describe a towel.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.545
Now Smolder, I
understand the school

06:20.647 --> 06:22.081
can be a bit drafty,
but that doesn't mean

06:22.183 --> 06:24.115
you can breathe fire
anywhere you want!

06:28.155 --> 06:30.555
What do you mean Trixie already
picked up Sunburst's genuine,

06:30.657 --> 06:32.157
pre-Equestrian,
Equine-ox chafing dish!?

06:32.259 --> 06:36.061
That was my job...! I
think. Wait. Was it?

06:37.164 --> 06:37.829
Agh!

06:43.470 --> 06:46.071
Ocellus, it's perfectly
normal for a changeling

06:46.173 --> 06:48.106
to struggle with
identity issues, but...

06:48.208 --> 06:50.509
Counselor Starlight?
When you're done,

06:50.611 --> 06:52.845
I need some synonyms
for the word "dry."

06:53.247 --> 06:55.714
Or really just help
explaining the concept.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.453
[poof] Oh, wait! Mrs. Cake!
You can't close!

07:01.555 --> 07:02.888
Trixie and I need
to learn the recipe

07:02.990 --> 07:04.356
for your Equine-ox cake!

07:04.458 --> 07:07.492
Oh, it's fine, dear.
Trixie was already here.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.228
I told her everything
she needs to know.

07:10.330 --> 07:14.399
What? NO! Ah! The Great
and Powerful Trixie

07:14.501 --> 07:15.868
might keep her promises,

07:16.070 --> 07:19.371
but the busy and distracted
Starlight sure doesn't.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.240
I promised to help her today

07:21.342 --> 07:23.308
and I haven't done
a single thing!

07:24.411 --> 07:26.278
Oh, that does
sound hard, dear,

07:26.380 --> 07:28.380
and I'm not sure quite
how to tell you this,

07:28.482 --> 07:30.349
but.. your hoof
is glowing.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.218
Of course it is...

07:39.760 --> 07:41.827
Trixie!? What are
you doing here?

07:42.129 --> 07:44.596
It's the one place I
knew I could find you.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.233
I am so sorry about
today. I'm just so...

07:48.335 --> 07:49.668
Busy. I know.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.970
Obviously, your students
are more important

07:52.072 --> 07:53.772
than your friends!

07:53.874 --> 07:55.873
That's not...
[knocking]

07:56.176 --> 07:57.609
Starlight, do you have a minute?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.480
Actually,
Silverstream, I don't.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.283
Besides, I need to lock up
the school for the holiday

08:04.385 --> 08:06.518
and it's time you
caught the train home.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.621
I'm sure a smart and
capable student like you

08:09.723 --> 08:12.891
can figure out the solution to
any problem over the break,

08:12.993 --> 08:17.328
but for now, the counselor's
office is closed.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.801
I have a cake to bake.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.041
♪♪

08:30.043 --> 08:34.946
Ow! Is this cake
supposed to be so sharp?

08:36.450 --> 08:39.718
I mean, it looks
really... interesting.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.554
Technically, it's
not symmetrical

08:42.656 --> 08:44.456
or aesthetically pleasing.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.526
Maybe it's not the best cake,

08:47.628 --> 08:50.229
but we made it together
and that's what counts.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.732
I'm glad you brought
it, and everything else.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.002
I'm very excited.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.506
This is going to be the
most perfect party ever.

09:01.008 --> 09:04.009
And with all of your students
home for the holiday,

09:04.111 --> 09:06.011
I won't have to worry
about you being summoned

09:06.113 --> 09:08.247
to your office in
the middle of it.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.850
Mm-hm! Nothing is going to take
me away from this party.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.153
Hello!? Starlight? Starlight?

09:17.524 --> 09:20.159
Sorry, this is a
private cavern.

09:20.361 --> 09:23.195
Is Starlight here!? I
was told she'd be here!

09:23.597 --> 09:24.563
What's wrong?

09:24.865 --> 09:26.998
I'm Terramar,
Silverstream's brother.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.900
I've been looking
all over for you.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.902
Silverstream is missing!

09:37.811 --> 09:38.810
I don't understand.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.613
Silverstream didn't come home?

09:40.715 --> 09:42.347
Mm-mm. I was supposed to meet her

09:42.449 --> 09:43.682
at the Mount Aris train station,

09:43.784 --> 09:45.150
but she never showed up!

09:45.652 --> 09:48.153
It's a long way between
Ponyville and Mount Aris.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.554
She could be anywhere.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.590
Our parents are leading
teams of hippogriffs

09:51.692 --> 09:53.625
and seaponies, searching
the land and sea

09:53.727 --> 09:54.993
between here and our home.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.628
They sent me to
check the school.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.531
But the school's closed!
All the students are gone.

09:59.733 --> 10:00.599
Are you sure?

10:00.701 --> 10:02.801
I know she had a big
project due for Twilight.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.803
Do you think she might
have stayed to finish it?

10:05.205 --> 10:07.105
She never told me
about a project...

10:07.207 --> 10:08.340
Well, to be fair,

10:08.442 --> 10:10.742
you closed your office
the last time she came by.

10:10.844 --> 10:11.511
Really..?

10:12.813 --> 10:13.845
What kind of counselor

10:13.947 --> 10:16.048
turns away a student
with a problem!?!

10:16.850 --> 10:18.884
The kind with too
much on her plate.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.086
Starlight has always
gone out of her way

10:21.188 --> 10:24.556
for her students.
And I mean, <i>ALWAYS</i>.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.259
Except apparently
when it matters.

10:27.561 --> 10:28.960
This is all my fault!

10:29.362 --> 10:30.762
You all go back
to the party.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.531
Terramar and I will
check the school.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.199
We'll find your sister.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.705
I should have known
it couldn't last.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.408
Party perfection is
more of a "Pinkie" thing.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.110
Mm. I wasn't going to
say anything,

10:45.312 --> 10:47.913
but these flowers
are just glued on so,

10:48.115 --> 10:50.548
technically it wasn't
perfect already.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.486
But that's probably
not important.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.425
You check the grounds
and I'll look inside!

11:02.362 --> 11:03.395
Silverstream?

Did you check her room?

11:29.756 --> 11:31.790
Well, she's not here.

11:31.892 --> 11:35.561
No, she isn't. But look at this.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.429
A cockatrice?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.330
Could that be what
her project was on?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.169
You don't think she went
into the Everfree Forest

11:44.271 --> 11:47.005
to find a Cockatrice
by herself, do you!?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.374
I don't know, but I'm
going to find out!

11:52.813 --> 11:54.511
[poof] Ha ha! [poof]

12:02.856 --> 12:04.756
We couldn't let you
handle this alone.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.226
Technically, she
wasn't alone...

bit of the blame

12:22.709 --> 12:25.377
for pressuring you into
leaving work early...

12:25.979 --> 12:28.046
But I don't want
to ruin your party!

12:28.248 --> 12:29.915
We can still
have a party.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.317
A search party.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.552
Can we talk about
all this later?

12:34.654 --> 12:37.388
Silverstream might be in
the Everfree Forest alone!

12:38.692 --> 12:41.460
We think she went in to do
research on Cockatrices.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.162
What!? The gaze of the
cockatrice is known

12:44.264 --> 12:46.965
to petrify any who
dare to cross its path!

12:47.067 --> 12:50.135
And the reptilian birds
are elusive and solitary!

12:50.237 --> 12:52.003
Where would we even start!?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.473
<i>I</i> have a lot of

how to find a Cockatrice?

No. But usually when

in the forest I
don't want to meet,

14:17.157 --> 14:18.390

14:21.094 --> 14:22.694
Hm! Suit yourself.

14:22.796 --> 14:25.263
Um, according to
Silverstream's research,

14:25.365 --> 14:29.033
"<i>the Cockatrice prefers rocky</i>
<i> terrain and ample shade</i>."

14:29.235 --> 14:30.735
Rocks and shade.

14:31.137 --> 14:34.573
Hmm, I can't imagine where
we'll find THAT in a forest...

14:34.975 --> 14:37.809
Actually, rocks aren't the
most hospitable environment

14:37.911 --> 14:39.410
for shade trees.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.813
Technically, pine
trees like Pinus Cembra

14:41.915 --> 14:45.049
or Pinus Sylvestris can
grow from narrow crevasses

14:45.151 --> 14:47.452
or cracks in a
rocky rhizosphere.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.120
You complete me.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.721
There's some pine
trees over there!

15:01.434 --> 15:03.501
I thought you said
they were solitary!

15:03.603 --> 15:06.305
They are! This must be
some kind of migration.

15:06.407 --> 15:09.140
Ooh! At least there's no
sign of Silverstream...

15:09.242 --> 15:10.575
I can't imagine getting caught

15:10.677 --> 15:11.943
in the middle of that flock.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.012
It's just lucky
we're all over here

15:14.114 --> 15:15.280
and they're all over there.

15:19.019 --> 15:19.651

15:19.753 --> 15:21.219
Don't even say it!

15:21.321 --> 15:24.222
Whatever you do,
don't look at them.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.758
Their gaze can
turn you to stone!

Oh! I have to get word
back to our parents

that Silverstream
could be surrounded

17:58.811 --> 18:00.211
That seems a little extreme.

18:00.313 --> 18:04.415
Really!? If I hadn't galloped
off to a holiday celebration,

18:04.517 --> 18:06.584
Silverstream would be
safe with her family

18:06.686 --> 18:08.687
and you'd all be

18:09.289 --> 18:11.422
Instead, my student is missing;

18:11.524 --> 18:14.692
we're surrounded by a flock
of petrifying.. chicken-snakes!

18:14.894 --> 18:17.962
And Maud's boyfriend was
turned into a hunk of rock!

18:18.464 --> 18:20.499
You got the hunk part right...

18:21.401 --> 18:24.769
And to top it off, we have
<i>no</i> idea if Silverstream

18:24.871 --> 18:26.737
even came to Everfree at all,

18:26.839 --> 18:28.707
but I have no idea
where else to look!

18:29.709 --> 18:31.242

18:34.547 --> 18:36.915

This is Edith. She's
helping me with my project.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.652
I.. don't understand.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.455
After you encouraged me
to solve my own problem,

19:17.557 --> 19:20.758
I decided to get my
project done <i>before</i> I left.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.927
That way I could really
focus on my family

19:23.029 --> 19:26.164
during my visit. The school
was closed so I came here.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.198
Why didn't you tell anyone?

19:28.300 --> 19:29.900

19:30.302 --> 19:32.636
Oh, no! I'm so sorry.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.004
Once Edith volunteered to help,

19:34.106 --> 19:36.006
I guess I lost track of time.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.675
Cockatrice's are really friendly

19:37.777 --> 19:39.344
if you know how to
interact with them.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.082
I can't believe you figured out

19:45.184 --> 19:47.351
how to trigger her
nesting response.

19:47.553 --> 19:50.020
They are really
fascinating creatures.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.122
Did you know that they migrate

19:51.224 --> 19:52.990
to the Everfree
Forest once a year!

19:53.092 --> 19:54.959
Can you <i>imagine</i>
what would happen

19:55.061 --> 19:57.327
if you stumbled on a
whole flock of these!?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.631
I have a few ideas...

20:02.601 --> 20:03.267
Agh!

20:04.537 --> 20:06.904
I'm sorry you got turned
to stone looking for me,

20:07.206 --> 20:09.808
but I'm glad Edith was
able to turn you back.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.243
How do you tell the difference..?

20:12.945 --> 20:14.945
I have mixed feelings about it.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.815
Technically, I will
always be a stick pony,

20:17.917 --> 20:19.617
but the experience has given me

20:19.719 --> 20:21.218
an even deeper appreciation

20:21.320 --> 20:23.821
for the density and
permanence of rock.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.756
Swoon.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.892
Silverstream and I
should get going,

20:27.994 --> 20:29.327
but I wanted to thank you

20:29.429 --> 20:31.296
for everything you
did to help find her.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.631
I just wish I
hadn't abandoned her

20:33.733 --> 20:35.233
in the first place...

20:35.435 --> 20:37.801
Starlight, you
didn't abandon her.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.270
I might as well have!

20:39.372 --> 20:40.971
And even though it
turned out all right,

20:41.173 --> 20:43.040
things could have
been a lot worse.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.576
You can't be expected to
supervise your students

20:45.678 --> 20:47.311
every second of every day.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.679
I'm not so sure...

20:48.881 --> 20:50.681
I like that you're
always available,

20:50.783 --> 20:52.883
but it kind of makes
it OK to come to you

20:52.985 --> 20:55.786
with stuff that maybe
isn't <i>super</i> important.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.922
Of course, being a
school counselor

20:58.024 --> 20:59.790
is a big responsibility,

20:59.892 --> 21:02.860
but always being at work
isn't fair to anypony.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.963
Especially me.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.198
Do you think if I had
set times to see me,

21:08.300 --> 21:09.633
it might help you decide

21:09.735 --> 21:11.369
what you really
need to talk about?

21:11.471 --> 21:14.138
To be honest, you really
weren't very helpful

21:14.240 --> 21:15.706
with the other stuff anyway.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.208
Yeah... Wait, what!?
