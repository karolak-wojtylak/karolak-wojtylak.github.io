WEBVTT

00:05.672 --> 00:06.570
I know!

00:06.572 --> 00:08.270
I can't believe it either!

00:08.272 --> 00:10.170
The map has never
called<i> me</i> before.

00:10.677 --> 00:13.412
I'm sure that's not why
she looks like that.

00:15.648 --> 00:17.047
Actually it is.

00:17.049 --> 00:18.751
Well, it's that and the fact
that you're being called

00:18.753 --> 00:19.851
to the royal palace!

00:20.153 --> 00:23.088
I mean, what in Equestria
could be going on there?

00:23.090 --> 00:25.391
Do you want me to come
with you? No. I shouldn't.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.227
The map just called you
for a reason, right?

00:28.229 --> 00:29.328
Though maybe it's a mistake.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.328
Not because of you!

00:30.330 --> 00:33.198
Because it's never called
just one of us before.

00:34.867 --> 00:38.203
I also wasn't nervous
before, but now...

00:38.205 --> 00:39.203
Don't worry.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.073
For all we know,
it's something small!

00:41.075 --> 00:42.673
Like maybe the cooks
are fighting over

00:42.675 --> 00:45.044
who has the best
butternut squash soup.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.946
Or the royal hairdressers
are fighting over a comb!

00:47.948 --> 00:49.648
Or ya know, maybe
the royal sisters

00:49.650 --> 00:51.216
aren't seeing eye-to-eye
on something.

00:51.418 --> 00:52.317
No!

00:52.319 --> 00:53.617
That's just crazy!

00:53.619 --> 00:57.322
Luna and Celestia
would never fight... again.

01:01.261 --> 01:04.596
So, the map sent you to
solve a friendship problem?

01:04.898 --> 01:06.465
Yes, Princess.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.100
Well, there's
nothing wrong here.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.601
Right, sister?

01:09.603 --> 01:12.971
No, everything's perfect
as usual, sister.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.586
Agh!

02:00.788 --> 02:02.821
Psst. Psst!

02:07.495 --> 02:10.229
Twilight...? Is that you?

02:10.231 --> 02:11.630
How are you here?

02:11.832 --> 02:15.067
I'm not, I'm still home.
It's an easy spell.

02:15.091 --> 02:15.968
I'll show you later.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.267
Anyway, enough
about me!

02:17.269 --> 02:18.167
I had to
check on you.

02:18.169 --> 02:19.167
Not in a
meddling kind of way,

02:19.169 --> 02:20.239
in a friendly
how's-it-going way.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.373
Sooo, how's it going?

02:22.175 --> 02:23.542
Not great.

02:23.744 --> 02:27.312
I think the problem might be
between Celestia and Luna!

02:27.314 --> 02:29.281
Oh, no! That's terrible!

02:29.283 --> 02:30.582
I mean...

02:30.584 --> 02:32.151
What makes you say that?

02:32.653 --> 02:34.753
You know how someponies
say nothing's wrong

02:34.755 --> 02:37.957
but you can tell something's
definitely wrong?

02:38.159 --> 02:40.359
Noooo.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.327
That's basically what
the princesses did

02:42.329 --> 02:44.263
when I said there was
a friendship problem.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.632
Only they did it more,
you know, regally.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.734
I wish I could help
you, but I can't.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.436
Both for map reasons and
because I have no idea.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.504
This is big!

02:52.506 --> 02:53.839
Like really big!

02:55.441 --> 02:57.042
But I'm here if
you ever need to talk.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.110
Or listen to music!

02:58.112 --> 03:01.080
♪♪

03:01.082 --> 03:02.514
Heh.
Comforting, right?

03:07.921 --> 03:10.422
Thank you so much for
breakfast, Princess.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.424
I can't believe you
cook it yourself!

03:12.426 --> 03:13.725
Of course, Starlight.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.496
I really enjoy doing it.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.365
It's a small way to
say "I care."

03:23.269 --> 03:24.637
Good morning, sister!

03:25.139 --> 03:26.372
Join us?

03:26.674 --> 03:27.839
Too tired.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.876
Please excuse me.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.515
Wow. Last night must have
been really hard on her.

03:36.517 --> 03:40.319
Perhaps, but she is
like this every morning.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.962
So I think Luna may be hurting
her sister's feelings

03:49.964 --> 03:51.830
without even realizing it.

03:51.832 --> 03:52.930
Poor Celestia.

03:53.332 --> 03:55.467
That's so sweet that she makes
her sister pancakes

03:55.469 --> 03:56.568
every morning.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.236
She's your mentor.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.038
I think you might be biased.

04:00.140 --> 04:00.938
Fair enough.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.541
So what are you going to do?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.409
Nothing. Yet.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.809
I have to get all the facts.

04:05.811 --> 04:08.380
I asked Luna if I could spend
some time with her this evening.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.150
Princess Luna is waiting
for you, Miss.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.289
Good luck, Starlight!

04:22.763 --> 04:23.962
Wow, Princess Luna.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.797
You do this every night?

04:25.799 --> 04:28.433
Lavender's calming scent
is known to aid dreamers

04:28.435 --> 04:30.402
in achieving a
restorative sleep.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.672
That's so thoughtful!

04:33.674 --> 04:36.107
I try my best to make sure the
ponies in this castle

04:36.109 --> 04:37.909
sleep peacefully.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.712
(old woman voice)
So then I said, "touring?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.414
More like boring!"

04:42.416 --> 04:44.483
Ha ha hah!

04:44.485 --> 04:46.685
You really are a card!

04:48.755 --> 04:52.591
But as always, my sister's
too busy having fun

04:52.593 --> 04:55.594
with dignitary ponies to
acknowledge anything I do.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.862
Humph!

05:00.767 --> 05:04.369
So both princesses are hurting
each other without realizing it

05:04.371 --> 05:05.904
and instead of talking about it,

05:05.906 --> 05:08.307
they're just getting
colder and more distant.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.807
And they're Celestia and Luna,

05:09.809 --> 05:11.977
so it's not like you
can just confront them.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.279
Actually, that's exactly
what I was gonna do.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.213
WHAT!?

05:15.215 --> 05:16.581
Are you CRAZY!?

05:17.950 --> 05:20.652
I mean, you do whatever
you think is best.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.187
This is your mission.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.257
Gee, thanks for believing
in me, Twilight.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.357
I do!

05:26.359 --> 05:28.694
But... the last time the
princesses fought,

05:28.696 --> 05:31.463
Luna turned into Nightmare Moon
and Princess Celestia

05:31.465 --> 05:33.632
had to banish her for
a thousand years!

05:33.634 --> 05:35.667
That can't happen again.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.167
Well, I can't do nothing!

05:37.169 --> 05:39.237
The princesses aren't the
best at communicating

05:39.239 --> 05:40.138
with each other.

05:41.292 --> 05:41.913
Sorry.

05:41.980 --> 05:43.702
It's just you
said "princesses"

05:43.747 --> 05:45.830
and "aren't the the best"
in the same sentence

05:45.852 --> 05:46.970
and it's making me nervous!

05:48.549 --> 05:49.915
I'm not much help, am I?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.049
No!

05:53.086 --> 05:55.821
Wow, I almost feel
bad eating this.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.089
It's adorable!

05:57.091 --> 05:59.624
Like I said, I
enjoy this part.

06:04.664 --> 06:05.697
Hi.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.032
Princess Luna! Wait.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.740
As you both know, the map
sent me here for a reason

06:14.742 --> 06:18.810
and I think I've
found out what it is.

06:18.812 --> 06:22.647
Really? Oh, that is
wonderful, Starlight.

06:22.649 --> 06:23.849
What is it?

06:24.151 --> 06:25.650
You two.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.686
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me?

06:27.688 --> 06:31.456
I think you're accidentally
hurting each other's feelings

06:31.458 --> 06:32.958
..without realizing it.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.463
Princess Celestia, does it
bother you that Luna never

06:38.465 --> 06:41.867
notices the wonderful breakfasts
that you prepare for her?

06:42.069 --> 06:45.638
Uh...yes. It does.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.575
Princess Luna, tell Celestia how
you feel about the fact

06:50.577 --> 06:52.344
that she never
acknowledges the work

06:52.346 --> 06:53.912
you put into
lining the hallway

06:53.914 --> 06:55.180
with lavender every night.

06:55.182 --> 06:59.485
I...Well, it's not
the best feeling.

07:00.487 --> 07:04.990
I'm sorry I never noticed that you
make fruit faces on pancakes.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.790
But nights are long for me!

07:06.792 --> 07:09.528
You might be a morning
pony, but I am half asleep!

07:09.530 --> 07:11.596
You think I don't get tired?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.565
I'm exhausted!

07:13.567 --> 07:16.802
Oh, I apologize for not noticing
flowers in a wall sconce,

07:16.804 --> 07:19.004
but by the time I get
to retire for the night,

07:19.006 --> 07:20.705
I can barely see straight.

07:20.707 --> 07:24.109
Even so, I still make
an effort to smile.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.446
Like smiling is so hard!

07:27.448 --> 07:30.415
I'm sure that's not what
Princess Luna meant to say.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.551
Is that what "exhausts" you?

07:32.553 --> 07:35.153
Smiling and being
adored by everypony?

07:35.155 --> 07:37.689
And you have it so
much worse, do you?

07:37.691 --> 07:39.491
You spend your evenings
flitting around

07:39.493 --> 07:41.526
giving ponies
lovely dreams!

07:41.528 --> 07:43.261
Oh, it sounds just awful.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.096
O....K.

07:45.098 --> 07:48.500
I feel like we should step
back, take a deep breath...

07:48.502 --> 07:51.736
Don't presume to know what it is
like to govern the dream realm!

07:51.738 --> 07:54.673
And yet you know exactly
what it's like to be me?

07:54.675 --> 07:56.107
Oh, please!

07:56.109 --> 07:57.108
Enough!

08:03.049 --> 08:04.048
There!

08:04.150 --> 08:08.954
Now you'll know exactly what
it's like to be each other!

08:14.761 --> 08:17.095
What have you done?

08:17.097 --> 08:19.264
I went with my gut?

08:19.566 --> 08:21.800
Switch our cutie marks
back this instant!

08:21.802 --> 08:23.300
My apologies,
Your Majesties.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.637
But I can't, even
if I wanted to.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.039
This spell lasts
twenty-four hours.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.775
It may have been extreme, but...

08:30.777 --> 08:33.278
I think it's still a good idea?

08:34.080 --> 08:35.046
What?

08:35.148 --> 08:36.546
You said it yourselves.

08:36.548 --> 08:38.883
Neither of you believes
your sister knows

08:38.885 --> 08:40.552
how hard it is to be you.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.521
So this is your
chance to prove it.

08:45.157 --> 08:47.893
Well, I could use
an easy day

08:47.895 --> 08:49.761
followed by a good
night's sleep.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.096
You can try.

08:51.098 --> 08:54.165
I haven't had an easy
day in well, ever.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.569
But now, I get to sleep and
tonight will be a breeze.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.938
All right, Starlight Glimmer.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.639
We will do this.

09:01.641 --> 09:02.473
Good choice.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.774
Not that you had one.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.011
I'm gonna stop
talking now.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.384
You switched their cutie marks!?

09:12.686 --> 09:15.787
The actual princesses'
CUTIE MARKS!?

09:15.789 --> 09:18.590
Uh.. I thought we
moved past this!

09:18.592 --> 09:20.959
It was the right
call... I hope.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.696
Are you OK in there?

09:24.998 --> 09:26.064
I'm good!

09:26.066 --> 09:27.232
Just uh ...

09:27.234 --> 09:29.100
reading an exciting book!

09:29.702 --> 09:31.036
He's going to think I'm nuts!

09:31.338 --> 09:32.871
He's not the only one.

09:36.075 --> 09:39.811
As you can see, Celestia and
I are switching places today.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.014
Huh?

09:43.216 --> 09:46.084
I assure you, I am more than
capable of handling

09:46.086 --> 09:49.821
all of Celestia's
"duties." Dismissed!

09:52.960 --> 09:56.861
So what is first on my
dear sister's 'to do' list?

09:59.298 --> 10:02.233
It says you have a few
public appearances.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.569
Store openings, judging the
Royal Rose contest, you know,

10:05.571 --> 10:06.671
that sort of thing.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.373
Oh, I knew today would be easy

10:09.375 --> 10:11.542
but I didn't think it
would be that easy.

10:53.853 --> 10:57.022
"Princess Luna Unhappy
With Student Fund-raiser?"

10:57.124 --> 10:58.656
But I wasn't unhappy.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.961
Um, you are scowling.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.329
I didn't mean to.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.131
I'd been smiling all day.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.233
My cheeks hurt; I
stopped for one second

11:08.235 --> 11:10.502
and that's when he
took the picture!

11:10.704 --> 11:14.372
Guess smiling all day isn't
as easy as you thought?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.777
It says here that
because of me,

11:18.779 --> 11:21.880
the school didn't raise enough
funds to go on their field trip.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.115
I-I-I didn't mean for
that to happen!

11:25.051 --> 11:26.317
I know.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.286
But you can't dwell on that now.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.722
According to the list, some
delegates are about to arrive

11:30.724 --> 11:32.223
for a luncheon.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.525
You need to dispel
rumors of Timberwolves

11:34.527 --> 11:35.925
in the White Tail Woods.

11:35.927 --> 11:38.930
The nearby towns have been in
a state of panic for weeks.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.732
B-B-But I have to fix this!

11:41.434 --> 11:42.868
You can't.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.605
You need to put on a brave
face and help these ponies.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.173
It's what Celestia would do.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.779
HELLO! GREAT NEWS!

11:54.781 --> 11:56.715
THERE ARE NO TIMBERWOLVES!

11:58.117 --> 12:01.119
There are definitely
timberwolves!

12:01.121 --> 12:03.488
I'm sorry, but I
couldn't stop thinking

12:03.490 --> 12:05.390
about those poor students!

12:05.692 --> 12:08.359
Normally, I have all the time
and solitude I need

12:08.361 --> 12:10.595
to work through my
problems at my own pace.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.498
Well, your sister
doesn't get that luxury.

12:17.738 --> 12:18.837
Ready for the
town hall?

12:26.178 --> 12:27.577
Glad that's settled.

12:27.579 --> 12:29.380
That only took
three hours.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.082
That got heated
didn't it?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.050
Still on for
golf?

12:32.052 --> 12:33.418
Oh, absolutely!

12:33.420 --> 12:35.286
You made it to the
end of the day!

12:35.488 --> 12:36.686
Yay?

12:36.688 --> 12:41.893
Hmm? Oh, yes I'm just
going to turn in then.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.295
Goodlight, Starnight.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.866
Oh, hello, Starlight!

12:47.868 --> 12:51.069
I don't know about you, but
I feel very well-rested!

12:51.571 --> 12:53.138
Where's Luna?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.340
Um.. she already turned
in for the night.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.442
Did she now?

12:57.444 --> 13:01.179
It seems my duties were harder
than my sister expected.

13:06.218 --> 13:07.452
Moon raised.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.521
It's even easier
than raising the sun!

13:09.923 --> 13:11.156
What's next?

13:13.827 --> 13:15.093
Of course.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.095
Everypony's asleep at night.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.164
Luna works alone.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.466
Oh, but it's nothing
I can't handle!

13:21.468 --> 13:23.802
All I have to do is
watch over Equestria,

13:23.804 --> 13:26.237
visit the dream realm
and protect ponies

13:26.239 --> 13:28.138
in their nightmares.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.274
My list was three
times as long!

13:31.977 --> 13:33.044
All right.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.979
Everypony's asleep.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.382
You're talking to
yourself, Celestia.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.150
But there's nopony
else to talk to!

13:39.452 --> 13:40.451
Yet.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.787
I can talk to ponies
in their dreams!

13:50.863 --> 13:53.498
Now to save some ponies
from their nightmares,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.967
which aren't real so it
shouldn't be too hard, right?

13:56.269 --> 13:59.036
Right. Good call, Celestia!

13:59.939 --> 14:01.906
And I'm talking to myself again.

14:04.743 --> 14:06.377
I care.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.378
I care.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.580
I Care.

14:13.318 --> 14:14.118
No!

14:15.487 --> 14:16.721
This is big!

14:16.823 --> 14:17.955
Like really big!

14:17.957 --> 14:18.923
Wah!

14:18.925 --> 14:20.859
Starlight, I'm here now.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.460
Tell me what's wrong.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.163
Going with my gut
was the wrong call!

14:25.165 --> 14:27.365
I was supposed to bring
you two closer together,

14:27.367 --> 14:29.467
but I've only driven you apart!

14:29.469 --> 14:31.603
If you two can't see why
you need each other, then...

14:31.605 --> 14:33.438
Then I am back!

14:38.378 --> 14:39.978
Don't worry, Starlight.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.182
I know how to handle
Nightmare Moon.

14:44.484 --> 14:49.254
Yes, but can you handle.... me?

15:00.367 --> 15:02.000
This can't be!

15:02.002 --> 15:04.469
If Luna can turn
into Nightmare Moon,

15:04.471 --> 15:08.506
you can absolutely turn
into me, Daybreaker!

15:08.508 --> 15:12.410
The better, prettier and
more powerful version of you.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.113
No. I'll never turn into you!

15:15.115 --> 15:17.848
Deep inside you know
how powerful you are.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.850
You don't need Luna.

15:21.287 --> 15:22.386
That's not true.

15:22.388 --> 15:25.390
Even when we were apart,
I knew I needed her.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.593
Oh, please!

15:28.595 --> 15:31.162
You don't need anypony.

15:31.164 --> 15:34.499
You can do whatever you want
and all you have to do

15:34.501 --> 15:38.236
is get rid of anypony
who stands in your way.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.175
I never should have
banished you to the moon.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.344
I should have destroyed you!

15:46.446 --> 15:48.246
No! You can't do that!

15:48.248 --> 15:52.216
Day, night, sun, moon -
Equestria needs both of you.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.385
Without balance,
there's no harmony!

15:57.523 --> 16:00.491
Who needs balance when
you can have it all?

16:03.329 --> 16:06.397
You can't get rid of
me so easily, sister.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.667
Unless you plan on
smiling me to smithereens!

16:10.869 --> 16:11.803
Enough!

16:13.805 --> 16:16.774
I told you I was more
powerful than you.

16:19.811 --> 16:21.812
Ugh. So much black.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.414
We get it, you're sad!

16:23.416 --> 16:26.484
You could really use some.. SUN!

16:37.763 --> 16:39.430
This is all my fault!

16:39.432 --> 16:41.532
I never should have
gone on this mission.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.601
Now Equestria is doomed!

16:50.376 --> 16:53.411
<i> ♪ That smile's too wide. ♪</i>

16:53.413 --> 16:56.614
<i> ♪ It's obviously not real. ♪</i>

17:03.722 --> 17:07.325
Why don't you want us to go
on our field trip?

17:07.927 --> 17:08.860
I don't--

17:11.129 --> 17:13.633
I mean, I do!

17:13.635 --> 17:15.567
<i> ♪ That smile's too wide. ♪</i>

17:15.969 --> 17:18.837
<i> ♪ It's obviously not real. ♪</i>

17:20.139 --> 17:21.172
Celestia!

17:21.174 --> 17:22.473
I'm so glad you're...

17:30.516 --> 17:31.515
I've seen a lot,

17:31.517 --> 17:33.184
but I haven't seen this before.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.684
It's Starlight Glimmer's.

17:34.686 --> 17:37.622
She's afraid this is what would
happen if we continue to fight!

17:39.292 --> 17:40.290
What was I thinking?

17:40.292 --> 17:42.527
I'm never going
with my gut again!

17:43.129 --> 17:45.296
If you don't fix this soon, it
could have a grave consequence

17:45.298 --> 17:46.764
on Starlight's psyche.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.633
But my magic isn't
powerful enough.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.468
I thought if we
work together--

17:50.470 --> 17:52.470
I have your magic,
remember?

17:52.472 --> 17:53.938
It doesn't work in
the dream realm.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.640
It has to be you.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.775
Oh, Luna, I can't
do this!

17:57.777 --> 18:01.412
I was wrong. Your job
is so incredibly hard.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.481
You have to battle nightmares
and work in the darkness

18:03.483 --> 18:05.316
and do it all alone!

18:05.518 --> 18:08.753
It takes such a brave, strong
pony to do what you do!

18:08.955 --> 18:10.621
--and that pony is you.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.221
I walked a day in your shoes.

18:12.223 --> 18:14.992
I thought all you had to do
was smile and be adored

18:14.994 --> 18:17.027
all the time, but I was wrong.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.129
There is so much
more to it than that.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.780
Don't do this to each other!

18:38.517 --> 18:40.418
In order to defeat Daybreaker,

18:40.420 --> 18:44.288
you need only to trust in
your strength, as I do.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.629
You can't destroy me!

18:51.631 --> 18:55.133
I'm everything you want to be!

18:55.535 --> 18:57.301
No, you're not!

18:57.303 --> 19:01.372
You are not real and you
will never exist again!

19:08.213 --> 19:09.480
You did it!

19:09.482 --> 19:11.449
Only because you were here.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.952
I don't know how
you do this alone.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.152
So um...

19:15.154 --> 19:16.354
did you talk
to yourself?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.722
Um... a little.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.159
Is this really happening?

19:21.161 --> 19:22.693
Or is this still a dream?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.201
Welcome back, sister!

19:30.203 --> 19:34.005
I know you had a long night
so.. I made you some pancakes.

19:34.807 --> 19:35.606
Oh!

19:35.808 --> 19:37.842
How... nice.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.910
Ahem.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.215
They are ...delicious.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.483
Thank you.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.255
I know that face;
they're not.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.558
I know you have to be
perfect for everypony else

19:53.560 --> 19:58.429
and you do an amazing job but
you don't have to do it for me.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.232
In that case...
they are terrible!

20:03.202 --> 20:04.335
I know!

20:05.859 --> 20:07.606
But it means a lot
that you tried.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.979
I love you, sister.

20:09.344 --> 20:10.662
I love you too.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.578
So... this was real!

20:15.415 --> 20:18.616
Or was it not real and
this just happened now

20:18.618 --> 20:20.718
and not in my dream?

20:21.020 --> 20:22.486
I'm so confused.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.224
It's all real.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.960
It was the right call,
going with your gut.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.495
The map was wise to
send you, Starlight.

20:31.497 --> 20:35.333
Nopony else would have been
so bold as to do what you did.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.702
That's a nice way of saying
I came dangerously close

20:38.704 --> 20:40.238
to messing everything up.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.240
It was just
what we needed.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.942
The experience has made
us closer than ever.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.848
Wait...

20:50.850 --> 20:52.082
I'm not doing this!

20:52.084 --> 20:55.853
♪♪

20:55.855 --> 20:59.290
I believe that one means
your mission is complete.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.659
Wow. I can't wait
to tell Twilight!

21:02.328 --> 21:03.427
I already know!

21:03.429 --> 21:05.027
I mean I don't know everything.

21:05.029 --> 21:06.731
I just got here to bring
you your toothbrush.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.631
So this is just
a friendly visit,

21:08.833 --> 21:10.731
not interfering because I
was worried! I wasn't.

21:10.733 --> 21:13.404
I knew you could do it and
I'm so so so so proud of you!

21:13.406 --> 21:15.172
Tell me everything! Start
from after I hyperventilated

21:15.174 --> 21:16.807
and don't leave
out any details!

21:20.446 --> 21:22.412
Oh, uh, by the way,
there's a field trip

21:22.414 --> 21:23.512
you need to make happen

21:23.514 --> 21:25.650
and a.. timberwolf issue
you need to address.

21:25.674 --> 21:26.351
What!?

21:26.352 --> 21:28.352
Oh! Look there's the sun!
Time for me to turn in!
