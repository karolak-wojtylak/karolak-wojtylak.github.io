WEBVTT

00:07.541 --> 00:10.676
This just got real.

00:29.912 --> 00:30.907
Listen up, gang.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.518
We're almost there so I've
got a few things to say.

00:34.044 --> 00:37.203
First off, who here besides
me thinks this is the best

00:37.211 --> 00:40.163
Equestria Games delegation
in Ponyville history?

00:44.284 --> 00:46.015
And no matter what
your sport is,

00:46.105 --> 00:47.381
we've gotta give it our best

00:47.531 --> 00:50.692
because we've all got a genuine
shot at Ponyville gold!

00:53.863 --> 00:57.080
With the possible
exception of Bulk Biceps,

00:57.200 --> 00:58.671
Fluttershy and me.

00:58.930 --> 01:02.304
I mean, we're good and all, but
we're up against the Wonderbolts

01:02.318 --> 01:05.430
in the aerial relay, so
gold's kind of a stretch.

01:05.543 --> 01:06.661
Let's not kid ourselves.

01:06.870 --> 01:08.433
Don't feel bad, Rainbow Dash.

01:08.684 --> 01:11.178
We have absolutely no shot
at winning gold, either!

01:11.615 --> 01:14.199
Uh, that's because you're
carrying the flag for Ponyville

01:14.208 --> 01:15.465
in the opening ceremony.

01:15.607 --> 01:16.522
There are no winners.

01:16.917 --> 01:20.234
Winners or not, we still have
the chance to be awesome!

01:20.489 --> 01:21.586
That's the spirit.

01:21.849 --> 01:22.942
You hear that, everypony?

01:23.272 --> 01:26.860
Winners or not, we all still
have the chance to be awesome!

01:31.067 --> 01:32.524
But uh, let's
still try to win

01:32.532 --> 01:34.236
lots and lots of stuff too, OK?

01:43.771 --> 01:44.770
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies

02:30.189 --> 02:32.505
Phew! It's all in there, gang.

02:32.727 --> 02:34.760
Leave it to Spike,
champion gear carrier,

02:34.821 --> 02:36.589
for all your
gear-carrying needs.

02:36.751 --> 02:39.104
And the Ponyville flag?
You sure?

02:39.160 --> 02:40.390
And what about the flagpole?

02:40.614 --> 02:41.857
In with the portable ramp.

02:41.996 --> 02:42.995
<i>Whoa!</i>

02:43.297 --> 02:44.835
Give it a rest,
Applebloom.

02:45.075 --> 02:46.807
Aw she's just nervous,
that's all.

02:46.969 --> 02:47.988
Perfectly understandable.

02:48.277 --> 02:50.772
Whenever I'm afraid I'll forget
something and I start to panic,

02:51.069 --> 02:53.340
I have a simple
trick: I count to ten,

02:53.453 --> 02:55.765
and by the time I'm done,
I've calmed myself enough

02:55.779 --> 02:57.763
to get the job done
right every time.

02:57.843 --> 02:59.030
Easy peasy cider squeezy.

03:00.241 --> 03:00.833
<i>Hey!</i>

03:01.900 --> 03:02.854
Put me down!

03:03.166 --> 03:04.136
What's going on?

03:10.854 --> 03:12.606
Spike! Are you
all right?

03:12.796 --> 03:15.170
A thousand pardons, O
Great and Honorable Spike

03:15.182 --> 03:16.571
the Brave and Glorious.

03:17.055 --> 03:18.513
Huh? Who the what now?

03:18.714 --> 03:20.489
Thanks for bringing
Spike to us.

03:22.735 --> 03:23.627
It's OK, Spike.

03:23.888 --> 03:26.119
We'll have our hoofponies
go back for your bags.

03:27.211 --> 03:29.810
Can they hang back a sec and
tell me what's going on first?

03:34.191 --> 03:35.687
Mm mm!

03:35.945 --> 03:39.016
So the ponies here think
I'm some kind of hero, huh?

03:39.361 --> 03:40.480
More of the green ones, please.

03:40.766 --> 03:41.812
I like the green ones.

03:43.498 --> 03:44.649
<i>Last time you were here,</i>

03:44.854 --> 03:46.698
you got the Crystal Heart
to Princess Cadance

03:46.702 --> 03:49.660
in time to save this entire
empire from destruction.

03:49.793 --> 03:51.929
You are known
throughout my empire

03:52.271 --> 03:56.163
as Great and Honorable
Spike the Brave and Glorious.

03:56.554 --> 03:57.504
Isn't that awesome?

03:57.810 --> 03:59.471
You're a big shot here, Spike.

04:00.721 --> 04:01.346
See that?

04:01.648 --> 04:02.503
<i>That's you!</i>

04:04.284 --> 04:05.371
Hello, gorgeous.

04:05.824 --> 04:08.294
This is why we all hope
you'd do us the honor

04:08.302 --> 04:10.805
of lighting the torch at
the opening ceremony.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.903
You'd be the very
first dragon

04:12.919 --> 04:16.001
in the history of the
Equestria Games to do so.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.699
Of course, I'll do it!

04:17.964 --> 04:20.279
And bonus: I can do it
with my fire breath.

04:32.741 --> 04:34.796
Places for the
procession, everypony.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.120
Two minutes!

05:04.263 --> 05:05.847
And you're quite certain

05:05.853 --> 05:08.764
you also understand exactly what
you're supposed to do?

05:09.077 --> 05:11.514
I stand where you tell me
until you give me the signal.

05:11.664 --> 05:13.393
And then I walk over
and light the torch.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.650
Mm. Couldn't be simpler.

05:29.879 --> 05:33.642
Mr. The Dragon? Are you coming?

05:34.880 --> 05:35.615
Honestly.

05:35.898 --> 05:38.760
Would somepony help him walk?

05:43.931 --> 05:49.451
Now please welcome the
delegation from Ponyville!

05:49.707 --> 05:52.513
Ponyville forever! YAY!

05:52.920 --> 05:54.013
Awesome!

05:54.261 --> 05:54.889
yay

05:55.280 --> 05:56.476
Yeah!

06:00.560 --> 06:01.317
Whoo hoo!

06:17.882 --> 06:19.539
This is the signal.

06:22.768 --> 06:25.642
I'm giving you the signal now.

06:27.319 --> 06:28.928
Mr. The Dragon!

06:40.895 --> 06:41.800
Come on, Spike.

06:42.035 --> 06:42.948
Calm yourself.

06:43.385 --> 06:44.056
Count to ten.

06:44.452 --> 06:49.217
One, two, three, thousand,
fourteen thousand,

06:49.508 --> 06:51.877
twenty thousand,
thirty thousand!

06:55.443 --> 06:56.515
What's wrong?

07:00.415 --> 07:01.767
Tell me this isn't happening.

07:09.018 --> 07:11.092
Equestria, we
have a problem.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.564
Mr. The Dragon, would you
light the torch already?

07:25.779 --> 07:28.677
I don't know what it is, but I
just don't have the stuff today.

07:28.983 --> 07:30.001
Did you bring a match?

07:30.413 --> 07:32.952
You're a fire-breathing dragon.

07:34.058 --> 07:35.884
Then some cough drops, maybe?

07:37.666 --> 07:38.364
Never mind.

07:38.751 --> 07:39.543
I'll keep trying.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.153
Somepony go down and help him!

07:49.851 --> 07:50.883
Light! Light!

08:08.751 --> 08:09.508
Phew!

08:10.606 --> 08:12.152
How did you do that?

08:12.710 --> 08:15.038
I'm...not sure.

08:15.594 --> 08:17.945
Ah well, better
late than never.

08:20.023 --> 08:22.655
Let the Games begin!

08:36.247 --> 08:38.505
Oh! There are our
little superstars!

08:39.582 --> 08:40.856
You were fabulous!

08:41.028 --> 08:43.744
Made me sit up proud like
a cornstalk in August.

08:44.204 --> 08:45.912
Ya done good, squirt.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.758
You three
really were wonderful.

08:48.068 --> 08:50.366
But does anypony know what
was going on with Spike?

08:50.700 --> 08:53.028
He sure seemed to be havin'
a tough time of it out there.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.225
He put things right
in time, though.

08:55.430 --> 08:56.948
Actually, it was me.

08:57.469 --> 08:59.041
I didn't want him
to be embarrassed,

08:59.305 --> 09:01.693
so I cast a secret spell
to light it for him.

09:03.295 --> 09:05.289
Oh dear. Have you
told him?

09:05.527 --> 09:07.943
No, but he might have
figured it out on his own.

09:08.337 --> 09:10.113
You gotta tell him just in case.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.899
I know. I'm just afraid
of how he'll take it.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.190
I know what pride he
takes in a job well done.

09:15.358 --> 09:16.720
Psst. Here he
comes now.

09:17.153 --> 09:18.378
Act casual.

09:20.405 --> 09:21.153
'Sup.

09:21.826 --> 09:24.115
Spike! Is everything OK?

09:24.579 --> 09:26.234
I guess. I don't know!

09:26.729 --> 09:28.109
The weirdest thing
happened down there.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.302
Yeah, about that. I--

09:30.314 --> 09:32.474
I mean, there I was,
trying to light the torch,

09:32.481 --> 09:34.019
with all of Equestria watching,

09:34.292 --> 09:36.314
and feeling like the
hugest failure ever.

09:36.536 --> 09:39.188
And then the thing just
lit. It was amazing!

09:39.510 --> 09:42.378
Oh! Phew! I was afraid
you'd be upset.

09:42.723 --> 09:46.037
Upset? Are you kidding? Why
would I be upset to discover

09:46.044 --> 09:49.239
I can light fire with my mind?

09:49.900 --> 09:50.686
Huh?

09:51.071 --> 09:52.661
Look! It's the Great
and Honorable Spike

09:52.671 --> 09:53.845
the Brave and Glorious!

09:53.978 --> 09:55.221
Can we get your autograph?

09:55.541 --> 09:56.468
Sure!

09:57.964 --> 09:59.849
How you saved our empire
last time you were here

09:59.859 --> 10:01.393
was really amazing.

10:01.676 --> 10:03.822
Aw. You know what
else is amazing?

10:04.199 --> 10:05.346
Watch this!

10:12.963 --> 10:15.500
Don't worry. Once it bursts
into flames through brainpower,

10:15.510 --> 10:17.422
I'll sign another one
for you. Promise.

10:25.547 --> 10:28.005
Spike, may I have
a word with you a moment?

10:29.426 --> 10:32.003
Better be careful with that.
Might burst into flames later.

10:32.472 --> 10:33.324
Delayed reaction.

10:35.761 --> 10:36.700
Hey Twi, what is it?

10:37.211 --> 10:39.623
Hold on, hold on!
Give me a second.

10:40.130 --> 10:42.216
If I can set fire to
stuff with my mind,

10:42.517 --> 10:44.616
mindreading must be
just around the corner,

10:44.844 --> 10:47.754
and I predict that you
are about to ask me

10:48.003 --> 10:51.482
to set fire to something
with my mind!

10:52.062 --> 10:54.476
No. Because you can't.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.746
Oh really? So how do you explain
what happened down there

10:57.752 --> 10:59.147
in front of thousands
and thousands--

10:59.153 --> 11:02.429
I did it, Spike. I cast a
spell to do it for you.

11:02.891 --> 11:06.372
... in front of thousands
and thousands...

11:06.963 --> 11:08.208
I'm sorry, Spike.

11:08.470 --> 11:10.725
I just couldn't stand to
see you stuck like that.

11:11.383 --> 11:12.913
You understand, don't you?

11:13.147 --> 11:17.317
I, uh...I need to be
alone right now.

11:18.232 --> 11:18.864
Spike?

11:22.794 --> 11:26.001
O Great and Honorable Spike
the Brave and Glorious.

11:26.331 --> 11:27.937
Can I get your autograph?

11:28.364 --> 11:31.461
Sorry. You should probably
ask somebody special instead.

11:37.607 --> 11:41.344
<i>Our next event:</i>
<i>the aerial relay!</i>

11:42.091 --> 11:43.687
That's Dash and Fluttershy!

11:43.984 --> 11:46.439
Oh no, we can't
be late for that!

11:48.298 --> 11:49.783
Miss, step right over here.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.526
<i>Unicorns will no</i>
<i>longer be admitted</i>

11:52.530 --> 11:53.951
<i>without a disabling spell.</i>

11:56.700 --> 11:57.631
To prevent cheating.

11:57.832 --> 11:59.678
And make sure you don't
even try casting a spell

11:59.685 --> 12:00.718
<i>or we'll know it.</i>

12:05.231 --> 12:05.830
Hmph!

12:21.668 --> 12:24.427
If Ponyville medals here
we'll have 8 medals so far,

12:24.571 --> 12:26.655
putting us tied for the
lead with Cloudsdale.

12:27.797 --> 12:29.582
Unless Cloudsdale
medals here, too.

12:36.107 --> 12:39.120
Ms. Harshwhinny, I know
you're really busy but--

12:39.264 --> 12:40.610
What is it?

12:40.961 --> 12:42.712
Maybe there's something else I
can do for the Games, you know,

12:43.026 --> 12:45.996
something really worthy of the
Crystal Empire's admiration?

12:46.351 --> 12:48.321
What are you talking about?

12:48.439 --> 12:50.474
You lit the torch
for the whole thing!

12:51.360 --> 12:53.783
Well, actually, that
wasn't really--

12:53.797 --> 12:56.023
That wasn't "worthy"
enough for you?

12:56.755 --> 12:57.918
For ponies' sake!

12:58.158 --> 13:01.092
Next thing you know, you'll be
asking to put on a rock concert!

13:01.592 --> 13:03.463
Agh! Celebrities.

13:03.722 --> 13:05.016
Wait. That's it!

13:14.649 --> 13:15.834
Second place!

13:15.851 --> 13:17.170
We got silver!

13:22.558 --> 13:25.352
Congratulations to
all our medalists.

13:25.486 --> 13:27.449
And now, the anthem of--

13:27.453 --> 13:29.691
And I shall do the
honor of singing!

13:34.407 --> 13:35.791
Spike? What are
you doing?

13:36.321 --> 13:38.058
You know how they always
just play the music?

13:38.520 --> 13:40.337
Well, I know all the
words to our anthem

13:40.481 --> 13:43.299
and will sing them for you
now, loud and proud,

13:43.402 --> 13:45.036
<i>to the enjoyment of all!</i>

13:50.050 --> 13:55.855
And now, um, the Cloudsdale
anthem, as sung by Spike.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.352
Wait, the Cloudsdale anthem?

13:59.639 --> 14:02.212
They only play the anthem
for the winners, Spike.

14:02.401 --> 14:04.124
The Wonderbolts are
from Cloudsdale!

14:04.530 --> 14:07.363
But I don't know the words
to the Cloudsdale anthem.

14:07.734 --> 14:09.016
I've never even heard it!

14:12.314 --> 14:14.874

15:19.994 --> 15:21.898
<i>♪ Over now </i>

15:28.251 --> 15:29.678
<i>NAILED IT!</i>

15:35.531 --> 15:36.840
Spike, you coming?

15:37.496 --> 15:39.968
Nah, I got this
stuff to pack up.

15:40.417 --> 15:43.459
But you've been moping in here
for almost the entire Games.

15:43.697 --> 15:45.549
And tonight's the
closing ceremony.

15:46.210 --> 15:50.115
Which means we leave tomorrow.
Ergo the packing.

16:00.796 --> 16:03.190
And so the Games conclude
as they always do

16:03.539 --> 16:06.078
with the Ice Archery finals.

16:06.846 --> 16:10.078
<i>Ice archers, take your places!</i>

16:12.241 --> 16:14.946
Too bad Ponyville doesn't have
any ice archers competing.

16:15.217 --> 16:16.794
We don't have
anyone to root for.

16:17.041 --> 16:17.621
It's OK.

16:17.781 --> 16:20.610
Ponyville has 37 medals
and Cloudsdale 36,

16:20.809 --> 16:23.504
so looks like we'll be medal
champs of the Games anyway!

16:23.592 --> 16:24.421
Whoo hoo!

16:24.548 --> 16:27.047
But Cloudsdale has two
ice archery finalists

16:27.051 --> 16:28.243
down there right now.

16:28.550 --> 16:31.916
<i>If they both place, Cloudsdale</i>
<i>wins the medal count.</i>

16:32.331 --> 16:34.872
So you're saying it all
comes down to this one event?

16:35.297 --> 16:36.130
Pretty much.

16:36.624 --> 16:38.546
<i>Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!</i>
<i>Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!</i>

16:40.560 --> 16:42.667
Twilight! Come take this
extra seat next to me

16:42.675 --> 16:44.374
and freak out over
the medal count.

16:44.585 --> 16:45.467
I'll show you how.

16:45.674 --> 16:47.560
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

16:48.025 --> 16:49.559
Actually I was
looking for Spike.

16:49.785 --> 16:50.558
Have you seen him?

16:50.737 --> 16:51.715
He wouldn't come.

16:51.877 --> 16:53.336
We tried to talk him into it.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.848
But he wouldn't listen.

16:54.999 --> 16:56.710
You can have his
extra seat, though.

16:58.343 --> 16:59.683
Uh...Twi?

17:07.894 --> 17:09.619
<i>Spike? You here?</i>

17:10.400 --> 17:13.289
Uh, yeah. I'm super busy.

17:14.035 --> 17:15.697
Look at all this
packing left to do.

17:16.017 --> 17:16.741
Crazy, right?

17:17.139 --> 17:19.736
No more hiding out.
You're coming with me.

17:20.193 --> 17:20.874
Now.

17:21.379 --> 17:25.541
OK, fine. I'll come. Can
I at least wear these?

17:31.319 --> 17:33.028
Those aren't your
average arrows.

17:33.361 --> 17:35.588
<i>They freeze whatever part</i>
<i>of the target they hit.</i>

17:35.998 --> 17:39.484
<i>Whoever encases their entire</i>
<i>target in ice first wins.</i>

17:40.074 --> 17:42.737
<i>Keep your eye on</i>
<i>Number 7 from Cloudsdale.</i>

17:42.860 --> 17:44.216
<i>He's the favorite.</i>

17:49.777 --> 17:51.715
Honestly Spike, I don't
see why you're being

17:51.722 --> 17:52.858
so hard on yourself.

17:53.381 --> 17:55.783
I let everypony down. Twice!

17:56.333 --> 17:57.639
You never let anypony down

17:57.642 --> 17:59.272
so you have no idea
what that's like.

17:59.438 --> 18:02.003
Are you kidding? I've
totally let ponies down.

18:02.265 --> 18:03.289
That's not the point.

18:03.639 --> 18:06.751
The torch got lit; the aerial
relay teams got their medals.

18:07.008 --> 18:08.120
No harm no foul.

18:08.993 --> 18:10.878
Can we at least watch
from inside there?

18:11.233 --> 18:13.670
I'm not sure I'm ready to face
crowds in the stands just yet.

18:33.586 --> 18:34.202
NO!

18:40.107 --> 18:41.888
Steer it towards the field!

18:42.039 --> 18:43.475
Away from the crowds!

18:43.674 --> 18:45.781
Somepony cut the
disabling spell!

18:46.035 --> 18:47.159
There isn't time!

18:49.861 --> 18:51.814
Dash! Fluttershy! MOVE!

19:17.740 --> 19:20.372
That was awesome!

19:22.585 --> 19:24.667
I just wanted to
thank you personally

19:24.727 --> 19:27.274
for saving those ponies,
and the Games,

19:27.361 --> 19:30.421
O Great and Honorable Spike
the Brave and Glorious.

19:30.626 --> 19:32.448
You must be very proud.

19:33.740 --> 19:34.550
I guess.

19:34.776 --> 19:36.152
You guess?

19:36.542 --> 19:38.696
I just saw what needed
to be done and reacted.

19:39.106 --> 19:40.915
It just so happens
I can breathe fire.

19:41.114 --> 19:43.367
If any of you could do that,
you'd have done the same.

19:43.732 --> 19:45.354
Forgive me for
being blunt, Spike,

19:45.531 --> 19:47.510
but you're not makin'
a lick of sense.

19:48.493 --> 19:49.629
It's just how I feel.

19:50.275 --> 19:52.353
Wait a second. I
think I get it.

19:52.641 --> 19:54.519
You keep saying you
let everypony down.

19:54.790 --> 19:56.368
But we all keep
saying you didn't.

19:56.745 --> 19:59.605
You know who was disappointed
in you, Spike? You.

20:00.306 --> 20:02.380
And only you can make
it right with you again.

20:02.942 --> 20:04.247
<i>What would that take, Spike?</i>

20:05.557 --> 20:08.044
I don't know. Can
you turn back time?

20:08.427 --> 20:11.525
Cause I'd sure like a do-over
on that opening ceremony.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.551
We can't turn back time.

20:13.890 --> 20:16.819
But would you do me
the great honor

20:16.864 --> 20:18.835
<i>of lighting fireworks</i>
<i>in my place</i>

20:18.883 --> 20:20.688
<i>at the closing</i>
<i>ceremonies tonight?</i>

20:21.215 --> 20:22.076
Come on, Spike.

20:22.290 --> 20:24.647
You've saved the
Crystal Empire. Twice.

20:24.995 --> 20:27.211
I think you can
light some fireworks.

20:29.701 --> 20:32.095
I guess I have to at
least give it a shot.

20:39.968 --> 20:40.837
We did it!

20:41.053 --> 20:42.819
Ponyville won the medal count!

20:42.979 --> 20:44.786
And only by one medal.

20:45.040 --> 20:48.314
Hmm. Wonder which
medal that was?

20:48.552 --> 20:49.445
Bam!

20:50.470 --> 20:53.014
How's it feel to have opened
the best Equestria Games

20:53.022 --> 20:54.524
in Ponyville history, Squirt?

20:54.786 --> 20:57.059
Probably as good as it
feels to close them.

21:02.199 --> 21:04.154
OK, it's time.

21:05.859 --> 21:07.693
<i>You know, it's kinda weird;</i>

21:08.122 --> 21:10.228
no matter how many times others
<i>tell you you're great,</i>

21:10.636 --> 21:12.329
<i>all the praise in</i>
<i>the world means nothing</i>

21:12.403 --> 21:13.836
<i>if you don't feel it inside.</i>

21:18.770 --> 21:20.641
<i>Sometimes, to feel</i>
<i>good about yourself,</i>

21:20.973 --> 21:22.247
<i>you've got to let</i>
<i>go of the past.</i>

21:22.860 --> 21:25.523
<i>That way, when the time comes</i>
<i>to let your greatness fly,</i>

21:26.037 --> 21:29.032
<i>you'll be able to</i>
<i>light up the whole sky.</i>
