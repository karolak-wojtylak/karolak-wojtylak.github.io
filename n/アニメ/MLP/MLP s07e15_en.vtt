WEBVTT

00:03.270 --> 00:04.236
Is the banner even?

00:06.639 --> 00:07.873
Are the flowers in place?

00:08.375 --> 00:10.075
...by which I mean
completely out of view.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.414
I'm pretty sure
dragons don't like flowers...

00:15.516 --> 00:17.983
And what about the ceremonial
Dragon-Fire Flame of Friendship?

00:18.185 --> 00:19.184
Is it still flaming?

00:21.455 --> 00:23.055
Spike, everything
looks great!

00:23.157 --> 00:25.191
You're getting yourself
worked up for no reason.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.059
I have lots of reasons!

00:27.461 --> 00:29.162
In fact, I wrote them down.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.231
Uh.. You've been hanging around
Twilight for too long.

00:32.355 --> 00:32.932
Heh...

00:33.133 --> 00:34.031
Reason number one:

00:34.133 --> 00:36.368
I invited Dragon Lord
Ember to Ponyville today.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.838
Reason two, the Dragon
Lord is a dragon.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.941
Reason three: she's coming here
to learn more about friendship.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.375
According to Ember's letters,

00:43.577 --> 00:45.277
the dragons are
trying to be friends,

00:45.479 --> 00:46.777
but competing is
in their nature

00:46.879 --> 00:48.780
and it's leading to
more and more fights.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.483
Which brings me to
reason number four:

00:51.085 --> 00:53.052
The Dragon Lord wants my advice!

00:53.254 --> 00:55.487
And as the new official
Equestrian Friendship Ambassador

00:55.589 --> 00:57.857
to the dragons, I
can't let her down.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.725
I know you feel a
lot of pressure,

01:00.027 --> 01:01.493
but you've got this, Spike.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.529
I...

01:03.831 --> 01:05.564
I just want things
to be perfect.

01:08.668 --> 01:11.637
[gasp!] Thorax... you're in Ponyville!

01:11.839 --> 01:13.372
Of course I am, silly!

01:13.674 --> 01:16.975
You invited me and I'm not one
to back out of an invitation.

01:17.177 --> 01:17.976
Hey, Twilight.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.011
Hey, Starlight.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.713
Twilight: Heyyy...
Starlight: Hello....

01:21.515 --> 01:22.313
Thorax: Oooh!

01:22.415 --> 01:24.883
I can't believe you
did all this for me!

01:25.185 --> 01:26.018
Great banner!

01:26.320 --> 01:27.553
Love the stage!

01:27.955 --> 01:29.288
What's this flame thingy?

01:29.690 --> 01:30.822
Oh, it's pretty.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.726
You invited Thorax
over to Ponyville

01:34.828 --> 01:36.261
on the same day as Ember!?

01:36.463 --> 01:37.863
Apparently...

01:38.065 --> 01:39.999
That doesn't seem
like a good idea.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.134
How are you going to
entertain them both?

01:42.336 --> 01:43.969
I have no idea!

02:25.678 --> 02:28.380
I completely forgot
Thorax wrote

02:28.482 --> 02:30.582
and said he needed to talk
and I told him to come over.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.185
I didn't realize it was the
same day I invited Ember!

02:33.387 --> 02:34.486
What am I gonna do!?

02:35.588 --> 02:36.989
Well, maybe they'll
like each other?

02:37.691 --> 02:38.589
Probably not.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.894
Ember is tough and
self-assured and intimidating.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.394
And Thorax is...

02:43.496 --> 02:45.964
Spike, I'm so glad
you invited me.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.167
You are one of my closest,
nicest, most caring,

02:49.269 --> 02:51.603
most understanding
friends ever.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.307
Oh! Is that ice in the
shape of a dragon?

02:55.709 --> 02:56.707
Yeah, I see
your point.

02:56.909 --> 02:58.043
They might not
get each other.

02:58.245 --> 03:00.279
Or worse, they'll
hate each other.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.647
And if the leader of the
Changelings and the Dragon Lord

03:02.749 --> 03:03.783
get into a fight...

03:04.685 --> 03:07.052
I could be responsible
for starting a war

03:07.154 --> 03:09.154
that could ruin
Equestria as we know it!

03:18.632 --> 03:19.965
I'm sure that
won't happen.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.267
Now, pull it together.

03:22.569 --> 03:25.905
So... Thorax...
everything good with you?

03:26.807 --> 03:28.974
Well, honestly, no, not really.

03:29.276 --> 03:32.444
I have indigestion, not
sure if it's the new diet,

03:32.546 --> 03:34.646
or stress or maybe it's both.

03:34.948 --> 03:35.815
No!

03:36.217 --> 03:38.183
Yeah. It really could be both.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.585
And it might be affecting
my sleeping, too.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.554
Twilight: Uh oh..
Thorax: I'm a real tosser and
turner these-

03:42.656 --> 03:44.590
Sounds like you
really need to unwind!

03:44.792 --> 03:48.427
Er.. how about a er.. a trip
to the castle?

03:49.029 --> 03:50.395
You can't miss that view!

03:50.697 --> 03:52.097
Yes, the castle!

03:52.299 --> 03:54.099
I'll give you a
personal tour.

03:57.369 --> 03:58.838
Are.. aren't you coming?

03:59.240 --> 04:03.208
Yeah...I'm just gonna grab some
ice cream for us and catch up.

04:03.310 --> 04:03.943
Heh heh.

04:17.090 --> 04:21.026
Dragon Lord Ember, as the
official Equestrian Friendship

04:21.128 --> 04:23.562
Ambassador for the Dragonlands
and for Ponyville,

04:23.964 --> 04:26.498
I, Spike of Ponyville,
welcome you to...

04:27.100 --> 04:27.933
Ponyville.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.436
I gotta work on my
official speech..

04:31.038 --> 04:32.771
OK. Thanks.

04:34.374 --> 04:37.642
Heh heh.. right. The hug thing...

04:38.144 --> 04:38.644
Heh heh.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.147
This place has a lot of colors.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.350
In the Dragonlands, everything's
just rocks or the color of ash.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.451
ACHOO!!

04:48.421 --> 04:49.988
That's probably why..

04:53.126 --> 04:54.125
Hey, Twilight!

04:56.028 --> 04:58.196
Actually, I'm Starlight.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.198
Starlight Glimmer.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.066
Nice to meet you.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.402
Oh, sorry.

05:03.504 --> 05:06.137
I'm.. really gonna have to get
used to these pony names.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.073
Lots of "lights"
and shiny things.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.410
Er.. so where is Twilight?

05:11.712 --> 05:12.611
She's in her castle--

05:12.713 --> 05:13.211
OH!

05:13.313 --> 05:14.511
We should go visit her then.

05:14.813 --> 05:16.782
Part of friendship is saying
hi to your friends, right?

05:17.384 --> 05:18.049
Uhh...

05:18.151 --> 05:19.318
well yeah.. but...

05:21.787 --> 05:23.422
You're making weird noises.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.957
Do you have a stomach ache?

05:25.159 --> 05:28.026
[gasp] I think I feel one coming on..

05:29.429 --> 05:32.297
Well, you know what us dragons
say: push past the pain.

05:32.699 --> 05:33.465
Now let's go!

05:34.367 --> 05:35.701
Or.. we could stay here.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.969
Or I could go without you.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.574
Heh heh heh. Ah.
I like her.

05:42.798 --> 05:43.498
Oh..

05:49.515 --> 05:50.949
Good, they're not here.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.149
What was that?

05:52.451 --> 05:57.055
Uh, I...I said, it's
all clean in here!

05:59.125 --> 06:01.727
Er.. you must be hungry
from your travels.

06:02.229 --> 06:05.096
Please, I'd love to present
you with an official

06:05.198 --> 06:06.331
Friendship Welcome Banquet.

06:15.808 --> 06:17.776
So this is something friends do?

06:18.078 --> 06:19.345
I could get used to this.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.781
Actually that's
not food...

06:22.983 --> 06:24.116
Dragons love gems.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.651
Fine, but you're telling
Twilight what happened

06:26.753 --> 06:27.553
to her wall.

06:31.290 --> 06:32.389
Just keep her here.

06:32.491 --> 06:37.262
OK, yeah, enjoy
all the crystal... things..

06:37.664 --> 06:38.564
Where are you going?

06:38.966 --> 06:41.266
I thought this was an
official friendship banquet.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.201
Just gotta use the
little dragon's room.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.307
So this is my comfy chair
for fictional reads.

06:52.244 --> 06:53.745
This is my studying chair

06:53.847 --> 06:55.681
because the hard
back keeps me awake.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.153
Oh, Spike! I'm so
glad you're here.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.923
This castle visit
is getting weird.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.325
Twilight really likes chairs.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.330
Oh. What happened to the ice cream?

07:11.832 --> 07:14.666
What? Oh, right!
Uh, they ran out.

07:15.368 --> 07:18.737
Hey, I'm really sorry, but I
gotta borrow Twilight quickly.

07:20.715 --> 07:21.215
Wah!

07:23.076 --> 07:23.842
Be right back!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.444
But we didn't get to talk yet!

07:29.048 --> 07:29.882
Ember's here!

07:30.484 --> 07:33.218
I know; I saw you coming
and had to distract Thorax

07:33.320 --> 07:34.419
by showing him chairs!

07:34.721 --> 07:37.556
Why did you bring Ember to
the castle of all places?

07:38.158 --> 07:39.056
I don't know!

07:39.158 --> 07:41.693
Ember was asking for you, Thorax
wants to talk with me...

07:42.295 --> 07:43.395
we need to switch places!

07:43.597 --> 07:45.130
They might be
getting suspicious!

07:45.932 --> 07:49.067
All we have to do is make both
Thorax and Ember feel special

07:49.169 --> 07:51.236
and keep them apart
for a few more hours.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.704
We can do this.

07:54.373 --> 07:57.008
Ah! What's happening!?

07:57.732 --> 07:58.532
Ah..!

08:00.412 --> 08:03.849
I think it's the map!
It's calling... you!

08:04.151 --> 08:06.818
Apparently, you also have to
solve a friendship problem.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.826
The map is calling me!?

08:15.128 --> 08:19.699
Oh... amazing! The map is
really reaching out!

08:21.101 --> 08:22.867
Not a good time,
I get it.

08:22.969 --> 08:24.169
Starlight: Spike, are you here?

08:24.571 --> 08:26.905
Ember's eaten all of
Twilight's decorations and--

08:27.007 --> 08:29.407
Oh! Hey Twilight. Heh...

08:31.678 --> 08:35.046
Glowing map.. [gulp] glowing spikes...

08:36.382 --> 08:37.082
That's not good.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.316
I KNOW!

08:39.718 --> 08:41.954
At least your friendship
problem is in Ponyville?

08:42.656 --> 08:45.156
OK, OK, to pull this
off, I'm going to need

08:45.258 --> 08:46.225
both of you to help.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.193
You two need to keep
Ember and Thorax separate

08:48.395 --> 08:49.561
while I
get ice cream.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.130
You mean find the
friendship problem.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.331
Yes....

08:53.633 --> 08:54.566
Go easy on me.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.401
I'm under a lot
of pressure!

08:58.638 --> 08:59.771
Friendship Problem?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.073
Anypony got a
friendship problem here?

09:02.575 --> 09:03.775
Any problems to solve?

09:05.444 --> 09:06.444
Friendship problems?

09:09.114 --> 09:10.048
Friendship Problems!

09:12.017 --> 09:13.852
Anypony got a
friendship problem here?

09:14.354 --> 09:15.687
No? OK.

09:17.290 --> 09:21.226
Uch. Well I think vanilla
strawberry cream is overused!

09:21.628 --> 09:22.127
Hmph.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.328
Yes! Fighting!

09:24.530 --> 09:27.598
Uh, I mean, what seems
to be the problem?

09:33.505 --> 09:35.207
Ember, there you are!

09:36.009 --> 09:38.910
OK... right,
more pony hugs.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.012
How's your trip to
Ponyville so far?

09:41.414 --> 09:43.915
Well, I'm certainly learning
a lot about friendship.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.417
I had no idea it was polite
to decorate your walls

09:46.519 --> 09:47.986
in your friends' favorite foods.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.057
Heh heh. Oh, my...

09:52.559 --> 09:54.092
Where'd Spike and Starlight go?

09:54.294 --> 09:56.327
I feel like I'm being avoided.

09:56.651 --> 09:57.229
Hmph.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.832
No! They're just making
sure everything is perfect

10:00.934 --> 10:02.267
for your welcome party later.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.336
In the meantime, how about
I show you around town?

10:05.638 --> 10:06.536
Sounds good.

10:06.638 --> 10:08.406
I can't exactly learn
about friendship

10:08.508 --> 10:09.774
if I don't make new friends.

10:18.985 --> 10:19.285
Oh!

10:19.400 --> 10:20.800
Uh.. Hey Thorax...

10:21.254 --> 10:24.122
Um. Twilight and Spike had some
boring official paperwork

10:24.224 --> 10:26.992
to deal with, so looks like
you and I get to hang out.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.360
What would you like to do?

10:28.662 --> 10:30.261
But I wanted to
talk with Spike.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.563
He said he'd be right back.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.200
Oh you will, but first how
about we grab a bite to eat?

10:35.502 --> 10:38.837
Huh. Well you know, now that you've said
it, I am a little hungry.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.538
Is there a dining
room in the castle?

10:41.040 --> 10:41.707
NO!

10:42.409 --> 10:45.511
... I mean yeah, but
that's castle food.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.446
If you want the good
stuff, we gotta go to town.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.486
... and that's why you should
never let cupcake flavors

10:55.588 --> 10:56.855
get in the way of
your friendship.

10:57.257 --> 11:01.025
Huh. I guess I never thought of it
that way. Thanks, Spike.

11:03.795 --> 11:05.630
Oh, come on! Glow!

11:05.732 --> 11:06.465
Thorax: Spike!

11:06.967 --> 11:07.966
There you are!

11:08.368 --> 11:10.435
Done with your boring
paper work I see.

11:10.737 --> 11:13.271
Ha ha ha...! A-huh.. A-huh..?

11:13.673 --> 11:17.809
Yup, heh heh. I am done with whatever
Starlight says I was doing...

11:18.311 --> 11:20.511
Thorax wanted to get
out of the castle.

11:20.613 --> 11:24.249
I thought coming to town was
a really, really great idea.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.851
Well! Maybe now we can talk.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.521
Ssssure.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.521
I'll leave you guys to it.

11:31.923 --> 11:35.093
First of all, I want to say
thank you for having me over.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.995
I'm in a bit of a
leadership pickle

11:37.097 --> 11:38.595
and I could use
some advice.

11:38.897 --> 11:42.834
Well, I definitely want to help
you out as quickly as possible.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.537
Here's my problem: there's this
renegade group of changelings

11:46.639 --> 11:48.239
who still feed off of love.

11:48.441 --> 11:52.010
Even though I said, "Hey, let's
not do that anymore," they say,

11:52.212 --> 11:54.212
"Hey this is how we've
been doing things

11:54.314 --> 11:55.413
for hundreds of years-"

11:55.515 --> 11:57.382
-but it's like they don't
want to even though

11:57.484 --> 11:59.017
I'm the leader and I
asked politely...

12:07.994 --> 12:08.692
Hello!

12:08.894 --> 12:13.031
I am Ember, daughter of Torch,
winner of the Gauntlet of Fire

12:13.133 --> 12:14.533
and lord of all dragons!

12:19.606 --> 12:22.307
Usually when I do that, the
dragons are eager to meet me.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.909
That's not how
ponies make friends.

12:25.611 --> 12:27.679
Ahh... I get it.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.951
This is a weird friendship
thing you ponies do, right?

12:40.359 --> 12:43.027
Uh... you guys
are in town, too?

12:43.229 --> 12:44.295
What are you
talking about?

12:44.397 --> 12:46.097
You've been with
me this whole time.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.399
No, I'm Starlight.

12:51.036 --> 12:52.437
Riiiiight.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.572
I'm sorry, but you
can't blame me.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.741
You both look and
act so much alike.

12:57.143 --> 12:57.843
Both: What!?

12:58.745 --> 13:01.780
And they said to me just
keep saying the same thing.

13:01.882 --> 13:05.049
You know I think my leadership
problems started in childhood.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.518
I must've been three when ...
Three's a different story --

13:07.620 --> 13:08.918
and you definitely
gotta hear it,

13:09.120 --> 13:11.623
but the story about my
brother was when I was two...

13:12.225 --> 13:13.191
Or was I one?

13:13.493 --> 13:14.459
This is my seat!

13:14.561 --> 13:15.560
I saw it first.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.662
Well, I got here first.

13:19.031 --> 13:20.965
Thorax, excuse me for a second.

13:24.036 --> 13:25.135
Ponies, please.

13:25.537 --> 13:29.874
If I may, I think I can help
solve this.. friendship problem.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.345
You two should sit together.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.180
You both like the same place;
you both ordered muffins;

13:36.282 --> 13:37.180
you're both ponies.

13:37.382 --> 13:38.849
I think if you made
a little effort,

13:38.951 --> 13:39.885
you'd find that you
have a .... whoa!

13:42.021 --> 13:43.588
OK, that had to have done it.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.356
Come on spikes, glow!

13:48.127 --> 13:50.495
Hey, that was
really great advice.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.763
So what do you
think I should do?

13:56.102 --> 13:58.636
Actually, I uh need a minute.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.507
Alone. To really come
up with great advice.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.441
I'll be right back!

14:03.643 --> 14:05.844
[sigh] Great. No problem.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.645
Leave me again...

14:07.847 --> 14:09.114
It's fine....

14:09.916 --> 14:14.086
I'm just saying, you're both
purple ponies with purple hair.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.156
You both have cutie marks
with sparkle-y things.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.526
Heh. Mine's more of
a glimmer..! Heh.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.662
How is that different?

14:24.164 --> 14:25.597
Oh, good, Spike.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.932
Can you please tell
these two I'm right?

14:28.334 --> 14:29.634
They look very similar.

14:29.936 --> 14:33.871
Er.. Well, you know, one thing
friends do is let something go

14:33.973 --> 14:35.640
when it's upsetting
somepony else.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.240
But I'm right.

14:37.442 --> 14:40.411
Besides, who are you to be
telling me about friendship?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.281
I've barely seen
you all day!

14:42.583 --> 14:45.450
Uh.. well.. I've seen you...

14:45.752 --> 14:47.618
Are you calling me a LIAR!?

14:49.054 --> 14:51.622
Hey! No one yells
at my friend!

14:58.098 --> 14:59.964
Spike, get away from the bear!

15:00.166 --> 15:03.368
Actually the bear's a changeling
and he's quite gentle.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.903
Not anymore!

15:15.380 --> 15:18.082
Aaah! My worst fears are happening!

15:25.124 --> 15:26.425
NO!

15:26.727 --> 15:29.694
Huh. Back away, Spike, I'm not
going to let this dragon

15:29.796 --> 15:31.096
harm a scale on your back!

15:31.598 --> 15:34.466
You back away! I'm not
going to let you harm him!

15:35.068 --> 15:37.969
Wait, did you say you're not
going to let me harm Spike?

15:38.471 --> 15:39.104
Yeah!

15:39.406 --> 15:40.705
But that's what I'm doing.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.540
Uh..what?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.176
Yeah, what?

15:44.578 --> 15:47.412
Ahh.. Equestria as we know it is over!

15:47.614 --> 15:49.213
The war that pits
changeling against dragon

15:49.315 --> 15:50.381
is about to begin!

15:50.683 --> 15:51.781
And it's all my fault!

15:52.183 --> 15:54.653
My title of Equestria's
Friendship Ambassador is a lie--

15:55.355 --> 15:57.922
Oh. Hey. You guys
aren't fighting?

15:58.224 --> 15:59.658
Why would we be fighting?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.960
Because I accidentally
invited you both

16:02.062 --> 16:04.229
over to Ponyville
on the same day?

16:05.231 --> 16:06.198
Both: So what?

16:07.000 --> 16:10.001
So, I was trying
to keep you apart,

16:10.103 --> 16:12.303
because I didn't
think you'd get along.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.707
Oh, I get it.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.409
You thought he wouldn't like me
just because I'm a dragon

16:18.511 --> 16:20.111
and I'm bad at friendship?

16:20.713 --> 16:22.714
No! No! Of course not! But...

16:23.216 --> 16:25.050
Wait, isn't that
why you're here?

16:25.952 --> 16:29.320
I can say I'm bad at friendship;
you can't say it about me!

16:29.622 --> 16:31.456
You know what? I don't
want to talk about it.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.358
Wait, please...

16:33.960 --> 16:35.627
[sigh] I'm sorry.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.962
No, no. It's cool.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.498
You thought I'd be too soft
and someone like Ember

16:40.600 --> 16:43.668
would never respect me, just
like my own changelings.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.436
No, that's not it!

16:45.538 --> 16:46.605
Thorax! Wait!

16:47.507 --> 16:48.740
Oh, no.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.475
What have I done?

16:59.418 --> 17:00.952
Why are you still here?

17:01.954 --> 17:05.456
[sigh] Because I'm having
trouble leading my pack.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.426
So I don't really
want to go home.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.161
Wait, you're in charge?

17:10.563 --> 17:13.598
Ho boy, you need to
be more assertive.

17:14.100 --> 17:17.035
That's my problem,
I don't know how.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.371
I tried asking them to please
follow my directions

17:20.673 --> 17:22.506
and I even offered
a prize and--

17:22.608 --> 17:24.175
SHH! Stop talking.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.145
That's how you do it.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.281
Whoa. That just
gave me chills.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.116
I know you have
it in you.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.285
You turned into a
bear to defend Spike.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.255
Huh. I guess I can be tough when
I'm defending my friends.

17:37.357 --> 17:42.060
But.. when I'm just enforcing my
rules, I feel unsure of myself.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.262
There's nothing to
be unsure of.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.064
You're the leader
for a reason.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.399
Make a decision and
let it be known

17:48.501 --> 17:49.935
that the decision is final.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.537
And if that doesn't
work, turn into a bear.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.406
That's good advice.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.675
I know it is.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.777
So what's your deal?

17:59.079 --> 18:00.879
Why do you think you're
so bad at friendship?

18:01.081 --> 18:02.713
I don't want to
talk about it.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.549
Oh, you have to.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.184
How else are you gonna
solve your problems?

18:08.887 --> 18:11.189
Through feats of strength
and fire duels, of course.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.057
Hiyah!

18:17.097 --> 18:18.497
Uh... how did that help?

18:19.399 --> 18:21.332
Crushing another
dragon in competition

18:21.434 --> 18:24.069
establishes my dominance
and makes me feel great!

18:25.071 --> 18:27.872
Right, but how do
you think they feel?

18:28.174 --> 18:29.840
Humiliated! Ashamed!

18:29.942 --> 18:32.210
They probably want to run
away and bury themselves

18:32.312 --> 18:33.244
under a rock and...

18:33.946 --> 18:35.113
... never come out.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.881
They're probably sad.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.183
Kinda low.

18:38.785 --> 18:39.985
Definitely not happy.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.388
That's because that kind of
competition can divide you.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.790
And it doesn't get to
the heart of the issue.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.160
Talking about your
feelings does.

18:48.762 --> 18:50.094
A-Achoo!

18:51.298 --> 18:53.664
Ach. I think I'm allergic
to feelings.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.502
You know you don't have to  be
sappy or huggy-feely about it,

18:57.804 --> 19:00.405
but you should let your
friends know how you feel.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.007
Ah.. I know where
we can start.

19:04.242 --> 19:04.743
Where?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.145
Oh. Spike. Heh.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.212
I got there.

19:08.791 --> 19:11.191
♪♪

19:11.316 --> 19:12.417
I think they're gone.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.519
They probably never
want to see me again.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.588
Or ... they want
to see you now.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.325
Guess what, Spike?

19:21.027 --> 19:22.994
I know. I'm so sorry--

19:23.196 --> 19:24.663
LET ME TALK ABOUT THIS!

19:25.365 --> 19:27.565
I feel...

19:29.534 --> 19:30.201
... mad.

19:31.303 --> 19:34.472
OK.., that's a good
first attempt.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.041
Now maybe try to
be more.. specific?

19:41.413 --> 19:42.113
I'm...

19:42.515 --> 19:43.414
ugh...

19:43.716 --> 19:44.749
upset!

19:45.051 --> 19:46.350
You have every right to be.

19:46.652 --> 19:47.752
I KNOW I DO!

19:48.454 --> 19:50.555
And I know I need to
tell you how I feel

19:50.657 --> 19:54.125
because my friend, Thorax, said
it would make me feel better.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.593
AND IT DOES!

19:55.895 --> 19:58.296
Yeah! And I have no
problem telling you

19:58.398 --> 19:59.530
what you did
was wrong

19:59.632 --> 20:01.132
because my
friend Ember

20:01.334 --> 20:02.733
is helping me be
more assertive.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.169
Whoa.

20:05.671 --> 20:06.637
Nice!

20:06.739 --> 20:07.772
Ha ha!

20:08.974 --> 20:10.775
You guys should be mad at me.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.044
I was so worried about
how it could go wrong,

20:13.246 --> 20:15.179
I didn't even think about
how it could go right.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.849
Can you forgive me?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.685
I really do
feel better.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.187
So, yeah. I'm good.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.822
Heh. Me too.

20:27.735 --> 20:29.134
Oooh..

20:29.259 --> 20:30.995
Ohhh.. again?

20:33.700 --> 20:36.267
No way! It's finally happening!

20:36.569 --> 20:37.936
I solved a friendship problem!

20:38.238 --> 20:40.271
Actually, you created
the friendship problem

20:40.373 --> 20:41.706
by not trusting your friends.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.509
Yeah, but then I solved
it by learning my lesson.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.744
I should have told
my two friends

20:46.846 --> 20:48.346
about each other immediately,

20:48.648 --> 20:50.581
instead of assuming
they wouldn't get along.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.083
Good job, Spike.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.485
Is this another part
of pony friendship?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.554
Telling each other what
you learned all the time?

20:58.391 --> 20:59.523
Yeah, pretty much!

20:59.625 --> 21:00.091
Yep!

21:03.295 --> 21:05.563
Spike: So! As a
show of unity,

21:05.665 --> 21:08.132
I present the Dragon Fire
Flame of Friendship

21:08.334 --> 21:09.834
to both Dragon Lord Ember

21:09.936 --> 21:12.403
and Thorax, Leader of
the Changeling Pack.

21:12.805 --> 21:16.073
May the Flame of Friendship
burn for eternity.

21:20.180 --> 21:22.112
A-Achoo!

21:26.451 --> 21:28.820
You should have more
things made of rocks.
