1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,562
Do you know how tough it is to jump higher
and more beautifully than anyone else!?

2
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:09,903
Athletes have their own
set of problems, too!

3
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:13,741
I can't forgive you for going after
such a sportsman's pure heart!

4
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:17,111
You're just jealous
because they are so cool!

5
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:20,049
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,195
This is the story of a distant past...

7
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:33,341
Yes. They traveled a path different from the
Sailor Soldier protecting the moon kingdom...

8
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:37,279
...and had fought against intruders who
came from outside the solar system.

9
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:38,781
They were:

10
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:42,377
Guarded by Uranus...
The soldier of the heavens, Sailor Uranus.

11
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:47,888
Guarded by Neptune...
The soldier of the deep seas, Sailor Neptune.

12
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:53,393
And guarded by Pluto...
The soldier of the afterlife, Sailor Pluto.

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,691
We were given a stronger power that
the other Sailor Soldiers don't have...

14
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:05,003
It's a power to protect this Earth
from enemies in outer space.

15
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:05,770
However...

16
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:09,108
When we were born in this day and age,
and had awakened to our past...

17
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:13,207
...the enemy had already nested
herself secretly on this planet...

18
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,347
To fight against this intrusion on Earth...
The greatest crisis of this solar system...

19
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:23,416
I will join the battle from the
boundaries of time and space...

20
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,340
Sailor Soldiers given
stronger powers than us, huh...

21
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:42,175
Those three... I had thought that they
were somewhat different from us...

22
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:46,677
And that's why those three
always act separately from us...

23
00:01:47,284 --> 00:01:52,847
They... protected our world in the
distant past, on a star of solitude...

24
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,223
It makes me cry!

25
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:03,359
And they are back, wanting to fight alone
once again, working separately from us.

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,164
Here, Artemis.

27
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:08,566
Thanks...

28
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:10,197
You're welcome.

29
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:12,098
Don't...

30
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:16,306
Don't think about
fighting along with them...

31
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:18,314
The world you wish for
and what they wish for...

32
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:20,213
...is completely different.

33
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:26,381
Wishing for a different world...

34
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,229
Right hand, Blue 4.

35
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:45,734
Pretty good...

36
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:47,903
But, I have Hayase on my side...

37
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:56,251
Hayase! I'll do my best!

38
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:58,751
Right foot, Red 3.

39
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:14,836
Go for it, Mimet!

40
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:15,929
Go for it, Mimet!

41
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:17,099
Go for it, Mimet!

42
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,232
Go for it, Mimet!

43
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:19,572
Go for it, Mimet!

44
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,838
Hayase is cheering for you, too!

45
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:22,003
Go for it, Mimet!

46
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,808
The new world record is right there!

47
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:25,178
Go for it, Mimet!

48
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:27,581
And this will make you and
Hayase the perfect couple!

49
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:28,607
Go for it, Mimet!

50
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:29,778
Go for it, Mimet!

51
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,947
The Death Busters are cheering you on, too!

52
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:32,887
Go for it, Mimet!

53
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:34,117
Go for it, Mimet!

54
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:35,488
Go for it, Mimet!

55
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,686
With this, you're assured
of the executive spot!

56
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:38,922
Go for it, Mimet!

57
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:40,395
Go for it, Mimet!

58
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,955
GO FOR IT!!

59
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:46,959
Mimet!

60
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,806
I'm impressed that you are training, Mimet...

61
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:54,801
Professor!?

62
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,972
What's the matter?
You coming into a place like this...!

63
00:03:57,014 --> 00:04:01,212
Oh, it's nothing. I had heard that
the next target was an athlete.

64
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:04,687
Since I had already chosen a Daimohn
most suited for the purpose...

65
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:07,588
I thought about bringing it to you for once...

66
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:10,149
Why, thank you!!

67
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:13,830
I'm counting on you, Mimet...

68
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,988
Leave it to me!

69
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,661
I, Mimet, will be going now!

70
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:27,640
Now...

71
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,937
Left foot, Blue 4.

72
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:37,677
I guess I will try for the world record as well...

73
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:05,711
Now, Hayase will finally jump!

74
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:10,219
Let's all focus our attention on this young
jumper who appeared out of nowhere!

75
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:13,722
Hayaseis on the run!

76
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:17,486
He jumps! A new Japanese record!!

77
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:20,125
Hayaseis said to have
been very frail when he...

78
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:22,393
...was a child, and often
went in an dout of the hospital!

79
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:26,129
And now, he is the proud owner
of a new Japanese record!

80
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,468
Congratulations, Hayase!

81
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:45,118
Shun...

82
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:48,622
I didn't know you had such hobbies!

83
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:49,750
Get out!

84
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:53,320
I told you to knock at all times
before entering my room!

85
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:57,026
Oh, my, how strong you've gotten lately!

86
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,779
"To Mr. Shun Hayase..."

87
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:16,979
Is it a love letter?

88
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,420
Stop it!

89
00:06:20,657 --> 00:06:23,251
Kaori, you've been acting strange lately!

90
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:25,989
Perhaps it's YOU who
is acting strange, Hotaru...

91
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:30,261
To write a letter that you
don't have the courage to send...

92
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:44,205
I'm home...

93
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:47,774
Oh, man... I'm pretty beat today, too...

94
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:49,741
We have a guest...

95
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:53,554
I'm so thrilled that you
would come visit me, Hotaru!

96
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,149
I'm so sorry I came so suddenly.

97
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:58,684
Oh, of course it's all right!

98
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:00,355
Stay as long as you want today!

99
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:02,797
Okay. Thanks.

100
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,896
So... it was Hotaru!

101
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:08,131
I'm visiting today.

102
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:09,502
Chibiusa!

103
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,702
You haven't even served tea to our guest!?

104
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:13,902
Oh, don't mind me...

105
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:16,572
I can't help it! Mama-Ikuko
isn't here right now!

106
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:19,880
If you know how, you do it, Usagi!

107
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,942
I'm still just a kid!

108
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,150
Is that the attitude to have when you're
asking someone to do something for you!?

109
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,590
It would be good if you could
at least make some tea!

110
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:32,094
I mean, you're drawing a blank
when it comes to studying!

111
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:35,723
That's something you shouldn't have said!

112
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:38,734
You don't have to pinch me for it!

113
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:42,465
You don't have to bite me, either!

114
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:47,602
I'm jealous...

115
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:51,914
You know, this house...

116
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:54,109
It really has a gentle feeling...

117
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,818
R-Really?

118
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:03,685
Hotaru, you wrote a fan letter
to Hayase, the track athlete?

119
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:05,718
What did you write?

120
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:09,332
I didn't write anything much...

121
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,162
You know...

122
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,862
I'm not all that strong, right?

123
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:13,835
So...

124
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:19,775
It's reassuring to watch Hayase compete,
because he was also frail when he was young.

125
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:21,470
I hope you get a reply!

126
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:23,741
Yeah!

127
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,709
But... it doesn't matter now...

128
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:30,209
This letter... I decided that I won't send it...

129
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:31,749
Why?

130
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:35,417
Because I don't know where to send it to...

131
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,891
And besides...

132
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:41,520
Then... Let's give it to him in person!

133
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:42,395
That's right!

134
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:44,866
Then she can talk directly to him, too!

135
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,163
Yeah!

136
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:47,897
Let's do that, Hotaru!

137
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,414
Wait for me, Hayase...

138
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:05,148
Right now...

139
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:08,180
...I will come steal your pure heart!

140
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:12,285
Fortunately, today is just a practice,
so this place is just for you and me!

141
00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:23,098
What is this thing!?

142
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:27,667
Anything that gets between
me and Hayase gets THIS!

143
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:56,499
There was a pest to come
between me and Hayasein there...!

144
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:00,674
Come on! Both of you,
you're taking too long!

145
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,871
Sheesh... This is embarrassing...

146
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:05,039
She's talking so loud...

147
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:08,448
In the end, it's just that
SHE wants to meet Hayase...

148
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:13,516
This...

149
00:10:13,556 --> 00:10:15,456
...is where Shun is...

150
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,282
That must be Hayase...

151
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:46,186
There's a rumor that he will break the
Japanese record yet again at the next meet...

152
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:51,290
An athlete of that caliber might be
sought after by the Death Busters...

153
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:52,419
Plu!

154
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:55,558
You're here, too, Plu?

155
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:57,190
Hello, little one.

156
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,966
Haruka! Michiru!

157
00:11:00,003 --> 00:11:01,402
What's going on?

158
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:02,962
To come here all alone...

159
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:04,303
I'm not alone.

160
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,243
Buns-head!?

161
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,711
Hotaru Tomoe!

162
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:16,474
Hurry, Hotaru!

163
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:24,250
What are those girls...?!

164
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:26,859
Hey, what's this!?

165
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:30,764
You don't have to corner
cute girls with so many people!!

166
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:36,267
All we want to do is to
give Hayase a letter!

167
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:40,374
You're so mean!

168
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,605
It's all right...

169
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:46,675
I... I'm fine just watching
and cheering for him on TV...

170
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,183
That's...

171
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:49,845
Is something wrong?

172
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,272
Hotaru, your letter! Your letter!

173
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:14,735
Go!

174
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:15,745
Go!

175
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,804
Hotaru!

176
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:19,712
Go, go, Hotaru!

177
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:21,512
Go, go, Hotaru!

178
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:26,515
Hotaru!

179
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,514
Did you want something?

180
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:30,291
Come on, Hotaru!

181
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:10,898
What's wrong? Hotaru?

182
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:15,295
I... Like I thought...

183
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:17,033
What's this? What's this!?

184
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:22,568
I was following the rules, and was
Just watching Hayase from far away...

185
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:28,014
Appear, Daimohn!!

186
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:33,286
What!?

187
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:34,347
A Daimohn!

188
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,590
Undohkai!

189
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:44,261
There you are, you little pests!
Get them!

190
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:50,762
Undohkai!

191
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:54,868
ROLL THE BALL!

192
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:04,076
Look out, Hotaru!

193
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:12,257
The letter...

194
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:18,126
Undohkai!

195
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:25,204
Serves them right!

196
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:29,405
Undohkai! Rush in and take
Hayase's heart crystal!

197
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:32,408
Hotaru! Stay here, and sit still!

198
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,415
The letter...

199
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:40,516
MOON COSMIC POWER...

200
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:42,854
MAKE UP!

201
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,785
ROLL THE HUMAN!

202
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:31,671
Finally, Hayase's lips...
I mean, heart crystal will be stolen.

203
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,542
Forgive me... this is myw-o-r-k...

204
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:39,548
I'm scared! This is scary!
This is too scary!

205
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:40,810
Stop that!

206
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:47,288
Trying to steal someone's
dream to jump higher and...

207
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:49,314
...more beautifully than anyone
else lacks sportsmanship!

208
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:53,557
For love and justice!
The pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

209
00:15:53,596 --> 00:15:55,325
Sailor Moon!

210
00:15:56,866 --> 00:16:00,563
In the name of the moon, I'll punish you!

211
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:02,434
And her apprentice!

212
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:05,839
In the name of the future moon,
I'll punish you!

213
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:07,804
You don't have to!

214
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:10,836
You're not that dependable
when you're by yourself, Usagi!

215
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:13,141
Undohkai! Do something about it!

216
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,342
Undohkai!

217
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,714
THREE-LEGGED RACE!

218
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:21,481
All right... while that's going on...!

219
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:22,855
Undohkai!

220
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:24,591
You can't!

221
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:27,928
Don't get in my way!

222
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:29,591
You're the one in the way!

223
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,603
Just give up!

224
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,352
All right! Time to retreat!

225
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:51,910
Undohkai!

226
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:52,613
Oh, shoot!

227
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:01,625
Huh? Something wrong?

228
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:04,389
If you're not feeling well,
it's better to go to the medical office...

229
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:16,801
W-What's going on?

230
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,373
Did you see that... That power...?

231
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,643
That girl... she's not normal.

232
00:17:22,685 --> 00:17:26,052
That girl is indeed a dangerous entity...

233
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:29,789
HEY! What are you doing!?

234
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:31,418
I'm sorry...

235
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:35,261
But I'm not sure what happened myself.

236
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:38,426
That girl... What in the world is she?

237
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:43,337
In any case... I was saved because
I had this shell on my back...

238
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:47,565
PINK SUGAR...

239
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,408
...HEART ATTACK!

240
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,584
That hurts!

241
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:00,486
A chance!

242
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,256
CRISIS...

243
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,693
MAKE UP!

244
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,553
RAINBOW...

245
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:38,924
...MOON...

246
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,589
...HEART ACHE!

247
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:50,135
Shoot!!

248
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:59,107
Love-Lovely!!

249
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,859
I'll get you for this!!

250
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:23,964
Mr. Hayase!

251
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,598
Hotaru came to!

252
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:26,835
Chibiusa...

253
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:28,867
You shouldn't do anything
too strenuous yet...

254
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:30,370
Mr. Hayase...

255
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:32,881
Um... I...

256
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:35,607
You're... a frail girl, aren't you?

257
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,214
Yes...

258
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:40,381
I was like that, too,
when I was a child...

259
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:41,549
I know.

260
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:42,455
Really?

261
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:45,824
Even at this age,
when I wake up in the morning...

262
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:48,352
I sometimes get the feeling
that my current self...

263
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,888
...that's full of energy and
playing sports is all a dream.

264
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,901
Mr. Hayase...

265
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,228
I know that feeling!

266
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,465
Really?

267
00:19:56,505 --> 00:20:00,066
You're the first person who
seriously listened to me! Thank you...

268
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:02,907
Please do your best at
the next track meet!

269
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:03,741
You, too...

270
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,010
...should do your best, so that you can
someday be strong enough to play sports!

271
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,281
Okay!

272
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:22,260
And he jumps!
Hayase cleared it!

273
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:25,332
He has yet again marked
a new Japanese record!

274
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:28,701
Congratulations, Hayase!!

275
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:35,701
