00:02.000 --> 00:04.434
What is your dream?

00:05.336 --> 00:06.997
No matter how far away it is...

00:07.038 --> 00:09.006
...if you have a heart to keep wishing for it...

00:09.040 --> 00:11.600
...your dreams are bound to come true.

00:11.643 --> 00:15.943
So stop doing evil deeds
and be a true good girl.

00:15.980 --> 00:19.609
If you can, Mimet,
you'll be the star tomorrow!

00:22.800 --> 00:24.165
Pure hearts...

00:25.570 --> 00:33.670
Hurry up and collect the pure
hearts that will complete me...

00:36.281 --> 00:38.681
Our messiah of silence.

00:39.484 --> 00:44.683
Now, my excellent minions
are planning as such.

00:45.323 --> 00:47.951
Please, bear with us for just a while longer...

01:19.223 --> 01:23.216
I suddenly look back...

01:23.261 --> 01:27.220
...thinking someone called my name.

01:27.265 --> 01:31.224
A pale fower of doubt suddenly bloomed.

01:31.269 --> 01:35.262
Now, the next song...
Sorry to keep you waiting!

01:35.306 --> 01:40.505
That's right, it's Jinta Araki's
new song, "Blue Crisis Love"!

01:44.382 --> 01:46.213
Araki...

01:46.250 --> 01:47.410
He's so wonderful!

02:03.001 --> 02:04.400
Amazing.

02:04.435 --> 02:06.562
Just like ants crawling over sugar.

02:06.604 --> 02:09.334
I wonder if those chasers
have nothing better to do...

02:09.374 --> 02:10.500
Chasers?

02:10.541 --> 02:13.908
The people who chase after
musicians and other celebrities.

02:13.945 --> 02:15.572
What do they do, chasing after celebrities?

02:15.613 --> 02:18.081
They don't do much about it...

02:18.116 --> 02:21.779
Yeah. I don't know how these people think.

02:21.819 --> 02:24.117
Right, Minako?

02:24.155 --> 02:26.487
Minako?

02:27.191 --> 02:28.590
W-What?

02:29.027 --> 02:30.790
What's wrong? You look dazed.

02:30.828 --> 02:32.625
O-Oh, nothing, really...

02:32.663 --> 02:36.360
Even for us, chasing after
celebrities really isn't something...

02:36.401 --> 02:38.301
O-Of course not!

02:38.336 --> 02:40.395
Hey, Mina? Jinta Araki is...

02:40.438 --> 02:44.636
We're going to be in high school
next year! We can't be chasing...

02:44.675 --> 02:46.768
Yeah, we got entrance exams
coming up, too...

02:46.811 --> 02:47.470
Usagi.

02:47.512 --> 02:49.639
- Do you really realize what that means!?
- ...and you have an announcement?

02:49.680 --> 02:54.583
Yes. We would like to select the heroine
for the movie coming out next July...

02:54.619 --> 02:56.985
...that I'll be the lead in... from one of you.

02:57.021 --> 02:58.181
A public audition.

02:58.222 --> 03:02.921
The first cuts will be from 4:30p.m.
tomorrow at the Town Hallin Minato ward.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.657
Since there'll be a swim suit competitionas
well, don't forget to bring your best swimsuit!

03:06.697 --> 03:09.928
Let's have a hot summer with me next year!

03:09.967 --> 03:12.265
My heroine--

03:15.807 --> 03:18.139
A-About this problem...

03:18.176 --> 03:19.268
Oh, this is...

03:24.849 --> 03:26.510
Mimet.

03:26.551 --> 03:29.520
Our messiah of silence is waiting.

03:29.554 --> 03:32.785
I hope you have the next plan already in gear.

03:32.824 --> 03:35.520
Of course! Look at this, Professor...

03:38.129 --> 03:42.122
Excuse me. Look at this.
He's the next target.

03:42.166 --> 03:42.996
Oh?

03:43.034 --> 03:46.128
Jinta Araki, also known as Alazin!
An 18-year-old with a wonderful smile.

03:46.170 --> 03:49.628
His newly released song
"Blue Crisis Love" is on the rise!

03:49.674 --> 03:53.508
At the rate he's going, it's a matter
of time before he gets to the top...

03:54.212 --> 03:56.646
A singer?

03:56.747 --> 04:03.516
Mimet... It seems like all
your targets are celebrities...

04:03.554 --> 04:05.920
If you confuse our
objective with your hobbies...

04:05.957 --> 04:09.188
...you won't go far here in Death Busters.

04:09.227 --> 04:11.787
Y-You're kidding...!

04:16.968 --> 04:18.959
T-That's not it.

04:19.003 --> 04:22.370
Hobbies, that really isn't...

04:22.406 --> 04:26.809
I choose celebrities only because
the hearts of people with...

04:26.844 --> 04:31.281
...higher charisma are more effective
in awakening the true messiah.

04:31.315 --> 04:33.215
Calling that my hobby...

04:33.251 --> 04:36.186
I think I'm going to cry!

04:43.060 --> 04:46.621
No, Mimet, you don't have to cry...

04:46.664 --> 04:49.929
I am just worried about you, because
you have potential for a bright future.

04:51.169 --> 04:52.397
P-Professor...

04:52.436 --> 04:55.462
Keep doing a solid job from now on, all right?

04:55.506 --> 04:56.871
Sure!

04:56.908 --> 04:59.877
The next high executive is you, Mimet!

04:59.911 --> 05:01.708
I'll do my best!

05:01.746 --> 05:03.577
Do a solid job.

05:06.651 --> 05:08.846
"I love you, Araki!"

05:11.722 --> 05:15.283
"I love Araki with a golden tan!"

05:21.732 --> 05:25.224
And you substitute this X over here...

05:25.269 --> 05:28.796
Usagi, you're amazing!
How do you understand this?

05:28.839 --> 05:30.807
Not at all!

05:30.841 --> 05:32.138
Hey... Where's Mina?

05:32.176 --> 05:34.576
She said she had a fever from her cold,
so she'd stay at home and rest.

05:36.380 --> 05:38.075
That probably means that Mina...

05:42.053 --> 05:43.486
I'm here...

05:43.521 --> 05:47.184
After all, I want to see just
one glimpse of the real Araki...

05:47.225 --> 05:49.591
I didn't start being his fan just recently!

05:50.027 --> 05:51.358
Um...

05:51.395 --> 05:52.362
Yes?

05:52.396 --> 05:57.095
A-Araki... When is Mr. Araki arriving?

05:58.002 --> 06:01.904
He won't be coming to today's audition.

06:01.939 --> 06:04.601
He'll be appearing as a guest
during tomorrow's second round.

06:04.875 --> 06:07.605
That can't be!

06:08.813 --> 06:12.613
I thought I could get one glimpse of him...

06:14.218 --> 06:15.617
You're...!

06:16.053 --> 06:17.350
You're...!

06:22.927 --> 06:24.053
This...

06:24.095 --> 06:28.589
The original T-shirt that Alazin
released right when he debuted...

06:28.633 --> 06:29.725
Not bad.

06:29.767 --> 06:31.598
We both put in some years, haven't we?

06:32.003 --> 06:34.597
I'm Minako Aino. Nice to meet you.

06:35.072 --> 06:38.337
I'm Mime- no, Mimi. Mimi Hanyu.

06:42.380 --> 06:46.612
Humans just have to put
everything into things they love!

06:46.651 --> 06:47.117
Yeah!

06:48.552 --> 06:50.679
Next, please...

06:51.289 --> 06:53.086
Yes! Minako Aino!

06:53.124 --> 06:56.093
I'm in 9th grade, and
my charm is my energy!

06:56.127 --> 06:58.687
My special move is a flying, spinning dig!

07:00.765 --> 07:05.202
There might be a kissing scene in
the scenario. What would you do?

07:05.569 --> 07:10.700
Well, I will keep the whole movie
deal a secret from both my parents!

07:13.110 --> 07:18.571
If you were to be accepted,
and were invited to dinner with the director...

07:18.616 --> 07:20.049
What would you do?

07:20.084 --> 07:23.884
Oh, I'll be fine!
I don't dislike any foods!

07:23.921 --> 07:26.185
I can eat anything that is served to me!

07:26.223 --> 07:29.488
Oh, but... I'm not too fond
of shitake mushrooms...

07:31.028 --> 07:32.495
Next, please...

07:33.197 --> 07:34.994
Oh, yes...

07:35.032 --> 07:38.024
I-I'm Mime-- Mimi Hanyu.

07:38.069 --> 07:41.004
My best wishes to all.

07:41.372 --> 07:44.239
Why did you decide to take this audition?

07:44.275 --> 07:48.006
Y-Yes... um, ur... uh...

07:48.412 --> 07:51.609
You can talk slowly.
Just calm down...

07:51.649 --> 07:54.550
I'm sorry... U-Um... er...

07:55.186 --> 07:58.280
Thanks, that's enough.

08:00.558 --> 08:03.049
I will announce the results of the first cuts.

08:03.294 --> 08:05.558
Today, these 5 contestants will move on.

08:06.630 --> 08:09.190
Only 5 will pass...

08:09.233 --> 08:10.530
It's all but impossible...

08:10.568 --> 08:13.537
Oh well, I just wanted to
catch a glimpse of Araki...

08:13.571 --> 08:14.629
#251 .

08:15.873 --> 08:16.396
You're kidding!

08:16.440 --> 08:18.738
That's amazing!

08:18.776 --> 08:20.641
#252.

08:22.513 --> 08:24.640
Those accepted, please step forward.

08:25.316 --> 08:29.047
We will have these people move
on to the second cuts tomorrow.

08:29.086 --> 08:31.611
Now, as we informed you earlier,
the final winner of this audition...

08:31.655 --> 08:34.215
...will be playing a role in a movie
slated for release next summer...

09:06.924 --> 09:11.793
If... I get accepted tomorrow...
What should I do?

09:11.996 --> 09:14.430
Maybe I can be accepted...

09:14.465 --> 09:16.524
NO, I'm sure I will be!

09:17.001 --> 09:19.970
I'm beautiful, I got the right curves...

09:20.004 --> 09:23.804
I, Mimet, can't possibly
lose against HUMANS!

09:33.717 --> 09:36.049
Mimet!

09:37.054 --> 09:41.718
Oh, Professor, you came!
How nice of you!

09:42.193 --> 09:43.319
Mimet...

09:43.360 --> 09:45.225
Yes?

09:45.830 --> 09:49.766
It seems you have a fever...
and your eyes are bloodshot...

09:49.800 --> 09:53.702
Working hard is nice and all,
but be careful of your health.

09:53.737 --> 09:58.333
I don't want to lose talented workers like you...

09:58.375 --> 09:59.239
S-Sure.

10:00.811 --> 10:01.869
That's right...

10:01.912 --> 10:03.641
I had totally forgotten.

10:03.681 --> 10:07.515
I'm supposed to steal Araki's pure heart!

10:09.253 --> 10:12.245
But then, Araki would die...

10:13.657 --> 10:16.285
My loving Araki is going to die...

10:16.327 --> 10:18.090
How pitiful...

10:18.128 --> 10:22.758
Maybe this audition really
doesn't have any effect...

10:22.800 --> 10:25.667
...and my professional debut as well...

10:25.703 --> 10:32.871
I see... If I don't attack Araki,
I'll end up being a traitor...

10:32.910 --> 10:37.711
...just when I'm about to fill the
role of the highest executive...

10:37.748 --> 10:40.649
I'm counting on you...

10:40.684 --> 10:45.621
Humans just have to put
everything into things they love!

10:46.957 --> 10:48.925
That's right! That's got to be it!

10:48.959 --> 10:51.723
I don't care about the
Death Busters anymore!

10:51.762 --> 10:54.560
I will burn the summer away along with Araki!

10:55.065 --> 10:59.559
I can become a traitor to
a syndicate like this for Araki!

11:00.170 --> 11:05.233
In the first place, I'm a good girl deep
down, who can't do anything evil!

11:06.911 --> 11:10.312
Who will wear the crown of the heroine...?

11:10.581 --> 11:13.311
Today, we will have the members
of the audience helping us decide.

11:13.951 --> 11:19.082
The person that 80% of the audience
backs up is the winner of our audition.

11:19.123 --> 11:21.614
Now, the first person, please!

11:29.533 --> 11:31.728
Artemis!!

11:31.769 --> 11:33.396
Oh, no, how did you know...

11:33.437 --> 11:36.338
It's not like you, Mina...
to keep it a secret from everyone...

11:36.840 --> 11:41.743
Well... it became rather hard for me to tell
them that I've been chasing after Araki...

11:41.779 --> 11:45.180
Now, please push the switch!

11:48.953 --> 11:50.818
Mm... how unfortunate!

11:50.854 --> 11:52.219
Next, #68.

11:59.096 --> 12:00.222
I'm after the next one.

12:00.264 --> 12:01.731
If you get accepted...

12:01.765 --> 12:03.062
Yeah!

12:03.100 --> 12:05.660
An idol pretty soldier will be born!

12:05.703 --> 12:07.364
That's pretty ama--

12:09.273 --> 12:12.868
This morning, I had my favorite omelet.

12:12.910 --> 12:14.775
In the future...

12:14.812 --> 12:18.839
In the future, I would like
to become a big actress...

12:19.383 --> 12:22.409
...a big actress who can handle any role...

12:22.453 --> 12:26.355
I want to become an actress,
no matter what I do...

12:26.657 --> 12:29.956
I want to be an actress...

12:32.496 --> 12:33.827
We'll do our best...

12:33.864 --> 12:35.161
How unfortunate.

12:35.199 --> 12:37.827
Next, #251 ...

12:37.935 --> 12:39.266
Okay!

12:43.207 --> 12:46.176
#251 , Minako Aino.

12:46.210 --> 12:49.611
I'm a 9th grader at Shiba Park
Junior High, in Minato ward.

12:50.981 --> 12:52.608
It's a small world...

12:52.816 --> 12:55.580
I give my best to you.

12:57.621 --> 12:59.851
This was really close!

12:59.890 --> 13:02.381
Then, next person please...

13:03.360 --> 13:05.191
- Do it well.
- Y-Yeah...

13:05.229 --> 13:09.029
Oh, man, the dream of
becoming an idol pretty soldier...

13:09.066 --> 13:12.365
But I guess it's okay
because I got to see Araki.

13:12.403 --> 13:13.995
I'm honored.

13:15.072 --> 13:17.905
That was really close.
But another chance will come by soon.

13:18.409 --> 13:22.277
Araki... I'll keep cheering for you forever...

13:22.613 --> 13:23.602
Thanks.

13:23.647 --> 13:26.741
But you will someday forget about me...

13:26.784 --> 13:28.684
No, not just you.

13:28.719 --> 13:31.779
Everyone will forget
about me at some point...

13:31.822 --> 13:33.221
But that's all right.

13:33.257 --> 13:34.815
Even if you forget about me...

13:34.858 --> 13:37.349
...the feelings you felt for me will remain.

13:37.394 --> 13:40.921
After they move on from idols,
girls take their feelings of love...

13:40.964 --> 13:43.694
...and learn what real romance is about.

13:43.734 --> 13:45.224
Araki...!

13:45.269 --> 13:48.067
But for now, give me your full support.

13:48.105 --> 13:52.439
I don't plan to end as just an idol, either.

13:53.377 --> 13:57.711
T-This morning, I had my favorite omelet.

13:57.748 --> 14:02.947
In the future, I would like to become a
big actress who can handle any role...

14:02.986 --> 14:04.783
Thank you for your consideration.

14:05.556 --> 14:09.287
This is our final challenger.
Please push the switch!

14:24.408 --> 14:25.807
This is most unfortunate.

14:31.648 --> 14:36.881
Unfortunately, we end this audition
with no one making the cuts...

14:36.920 --> 14:38.319
Are you all right, Miss Hanyu?

14:42.359 --> 14:43.326
Miss Hanyu?

14:51.268 --> 14:54.169
I am Mimet of the Death Busters!

14:54.204 --> 14:59.904
I applied for this audition to take the pure
heart of Jinta Araki standing right there!

14:59.943 --> 15:03.242
Appear, Daimohn Utahime!

15:07.417 --> 15:09.817
Utahime!

15:10.454 --> 15:12.854
CHARM...

15:15.692 --> 15:18.183
...BUSTER!

15:24.434 --> 15:27.062
Everyone is shaken up by my charm!

15:27.104 --> 15:28.264
They're in pain...

15:28.305 --> 15:29.237
Utahime...!

15:29.273 --> 15:31.400
Oh, sorry, they're shaken up, right.

15:31.441 --> 15:32.931
Get to it!

15:32.976 --> 15:34.204
Yes!

15:50.260 --> 15:51.249
A-Araki...

15:51.762 --> 15:54.526
MOON TIARA...

15:54.565 --> 15:56.192
...ACTION!

15:58.702 --> 15:59.930
What are you doing!?

15:59.970 --> 16:01.562
That hurt!

16:02.272 --> 16:04.570
You're the singer, and I'm the listener!

16:04.842 --> 16:06.707
Songs are everyone's friends!

16:06.743 --> 16:08.643
Bad guys who assault our idols!

16:08.679 --> 16:10.476
We, fighters of love and justice...

16:10.514 --> 16:11.572
...the Sailor Team...

16:12.916 --> 16:16.784
...will punish you in the name of the moon!

16:17.387 --> 16:18.285
Guys!

16:21.491 --> 16:23.891
VENUS STAR POWER...

16:23.927 --> 16:26.327
MAKE UP!

16:46.016 --> 16:48.348
Mimet!

16:48.585 --> 16:51.247
Pretending to be a chaser,
only to assault Araki...

16:51.288 --> 16:52.949
You are the enemy to every fan!

16:53.290 --> 16:55.121
Ally to every idol in the world...

16:55.158 --> 16:57.319
Sailor Venus!

16:57.361 --> 17:02.298
I'll have the divine punishment
of love fall upon you.

17:02.733 --> 17:03.893
Shut up!

17:03.934 --> 17:05.868
I wasn't pretending!

17:05.903 --> 17:09.304
But I'm Mimet of the Witches 5!

17:10.674 --> 17:13.302
Then, you really care about Araki...?

17:13.777 --> 17:16.712
That's none of your business!

17:16.747 --> 17:20.877
This way, Araki's heart... is ours forever!

17:21.885 --> 17:25.184
Chasers have their own set of rules!

17:25.222 --> 17:29.556
They're not supposed to cause trouble
to the idols that they chase! Sheesh!

17:30.360 --> 17:32.089
Araki is going to die!

17:32.129 --> 17:34.927
Geez! Of course!

17:34.965 --> 17:37.490
The Death Busters is an evil syndicate!

17:37.534 --> 17:41.971
Utahime! Kill all of them
with your killer songs!

17:42.039 --> 17:43.438
Utahime!

17:47.711 --> 17:49.645
What's wrong? Hurry up!

17:49.680 --> 17:54.174
To get a perfect song,
please wait while I warm up my voice.

17:57.454 --> 17:59.251
Hurry up!

17:59.289 --> 18:01.314
KILLER SONG!

18:08.999 --> 18:10.694
I forgot the lyrics...

18:10.734 --> 18:11.826
W-What!?

18:12.970 --> 18:14.835
N-Now, Sailor Moon!

18:14.871 --> 18:15.565
Yeah!!

18:18.008 --> 18:20.101
CRISIS...

18:20.143 --> 18:22.543
MAKE UP!

18:49.973 --> 18:53.238
RAINBOW...

18:53.276 --> 18:54.903
...MOON...

18:54.945 --> 18:57.914
...HEART ACHE!

19:03.453 --> 19:05.614
I remember now...

19:06.390 --> 19:08.984
L-Love is...

19:11.928 --> 19:16.524
Love-Lovely!

19:27.978 --> 19:29.172
T-This I can't...

19:29.212 --> 19:31.339
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

19:34.051 --> 19:35.848
I'll get you for this!

19:36.553 --> 19:39.249
They seem to be gathering pure hearts...

19:39.589 --> 19:41.784
For what purpose now?

19:41.825 --> 19:46.262
Pure hearts can become energy
for the ones who move the world.

19:46.463 --> 19:49.455
Or, they have already found the evil one...

19:49.499 --> 19:51.763
...the messiah of silence...

19:55.439 --> 19:56.497
Here.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.001
You return it, Venus.

19:59.509 --> 20:01.773
You've been a fan since 7th grade, right?

20:01.812 --> 20:04.042
I heard you've been chasing
after him all this time.

20:04.081 --> 20:05.013
Amazing!

20:06.416 --> 20:08.782
You blabbermouth!

20:11.788 --> 20:13.050
I am terribly sorry.

20:13.090 --> 20:14.785
I have failed.

20:15.325 --> 20:16.690
I'm so frustrated!

20:16.726 --> 20:20.423
I really am frustrated, Professor!

20:22.466 --> 20:26.027
There is always tomorrow, Mimet...

20:29.027 --> 20:33.027
