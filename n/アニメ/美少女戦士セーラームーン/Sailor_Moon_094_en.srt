1
00:00:02,282 --> 00:00:04,716
You want to have
your first kiss...

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:07,015
...in a romantic setting
with someone you love!

3
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:09,784
It's the dream of any girl!

4
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:13,084
I can't forgive those
who lack delicacy...

5
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:15,594
...and stomp on a
maiden's pure heart...

6
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:17,790
...going after the hearts
that yearn for a kiss!

7
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:20,425
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

8
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:27,676
We're studying at Rei's
place again today...

9
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:29,685
It's tough having
entrance exams!

10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,619
What are you saying?

11
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:34,355
Don't stall yourself
around here!

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,017
We should get going!

13
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:38,526
Otherwise Rei and the
others will yell at you again.

14
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:40,825
But...

15
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:45,627
Studying on such a
wonderful day like today?

16
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:50,401
I feel like I'm wasting
my precious adolescence.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,837
I won't be responsible if
you end up in tears later.

18
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:57,945
Oh, I wish I could go on a
date with Mamo-chan...

19
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:04,882
My wish came true!

20
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,650
Mamo-chan!

21
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,589
Usagi!
What about your studies!?

22
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:10,455
Mamo-chan!

23
00:01:14,997 --> 00:01:16,931
M-Mamo-chan...

24
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:28,275
Who is that...? That person...?

25
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:29,938
Usako!

26
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:36,712
Unazuki?

27
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:38,811
Hello, Usagi.

28
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:41,118
Unazuki...
Why are you..?

29
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:45,520
My brother Motoki is such a klutz.
He said he was going on a trip...

30
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:48,086
...but forgot the ticket
when he left the house!

31
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,928
So, I rushed out of
the house after him...

32
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:53,162
That was when I was
passing by their place.

33
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:56,433
And so Mamoru took me
to the train station!

34
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:58,372
Oh, I see...

35
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,204
Sheesh, don't surprise
me like that!

36
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:03,270
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,610
Oh, nothing!

38
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:10,384
By the way, Mamo-chan, that
riding suit is wonderful!

39
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,148
You look really
good in it!

40
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:14,588
- Damn, you're handsome!
- You think so?

41
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:17,683
You're so well-proportioned,
you look good in anything.

42
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:20,185
Hey, hey... Usako...

43
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:24,092
A kiss with Mamo-chan?

44
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,958
Wha-- Usagi, you don't
have to say it so loud!

45
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:31,339
And what about it,
Usagi?

46
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:33,365
Have you kissed Mamoru yet?

47
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,804
Uh, well...

48
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:40,743
I see...

49
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:43,547
After all, since you're
blushing so much...

50
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:46,979
You haven't kissed yet!

51
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,052
Well... That's...

52
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:53,425
Of course. It would be
bad for you to kiss now...

53
00:02:53,462 --> 00:02:55,794
...since you're still in
junior high, Usagi.

54
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:59,127
And you've got entrance
exams this year to boot!

55
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:04,231
Y-Yeah... I'm a poor little
student with entrance exams...

56
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:08,031
W-What about you, Unazuki?
You're in high school...

57
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:10,068
You've kissed a boy, right?

58
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:15,140
I can't really say
this too loudly...

59
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:18,679
I...

60
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:24,049
I do have a boyfriend
that I love...

61
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:27,893
...but I haven't
kissed him yet.

62
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:33,531
Why, why? If you love him,
why don't you kiss him?

63
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:35,230
Because...

64
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:37,865
I want to cherish
my first kiss...

65
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,470
...with someone I really love!
At the perfect time and place!

66
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:45,646
Until then, I want to save it...

67
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:48,806
Isn't it normal to
think that way?

68
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:55,280
Haruka!

69
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:57,290
Michiru!

70
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,794
So cute, to be
dreaming of kisses.

71
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:06,524
Oh, I think it's romantic.

72
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:10,737
Do both of you know about the
first kiss in world history?

73
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:16,842
The first people to kiss in
this world were Adam and Eve.

74
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,112
There are many
different kisses.

75
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,584
The kiss on the back of the
hand of someone you look up to.

76
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,957
A kiss of friendship
on someone's forehead.

77
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:34,462
A kiss on the palm of one's
hand to wish for something.

78
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:38,098
You really know a
lot of things, Haruka.

79
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:41,001
In 15th-century Italy,
it was said...

80
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:46,406
...that if a young couple kissed,
they had to get married.

81
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,002
They were really strict.

82
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,672
A first kiss...

83
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:54,808
You want to cherish it.

84
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,053
See ya!

85
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:10,260
Haruka and Michiru
are so mature...

86
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:14,962
Oh, that's right, Usagi!

87
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:16,869
I have a lot of
delicious cakes!

88
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:18,396
You should come visit my
place later and have some!

89
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,998
Bring your friends, too!

90
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:22,067
Really?! I'll go, I'll go!

91
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:24,705
Now, I have to work!
Well, I'll see you later!

92
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:25,975
Sure!

93
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:28,415
Cake! A cake!

94
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:31,876
I'm such a kid after all...

95
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:39,258
A first kiss, huh..?

96
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:42,630
They are just so cute...
It's nice.

97
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:46,192
We don't have the luxury to
be falling in love right now.

98
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:47,998
It's dangerous.

99
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:53,168
Honest girls like that are
easily targeted by the Daimohn.

100
00:05:54,877 --> 00:05:57,471
You're right.
The owner of a pure heart...

101
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:59,378
We have to be careful.

102
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:07,417
Kaorinite...

103
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:08,423
Yes.

104
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:10,857
You have been
piling up failures...

105
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:14,021
But I'm sure you have
found a new target?

106
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:15,886
Yes!

107
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:21,559
A girl with a pure heart
that dreams ofa first kiss.

108
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:23,903
A kiss, huh?

109
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,169
I haven't done such
a thing in years...

110
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:51,061
I guess this is it.

111
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:58,768
My first kiss...
With someone I love...

112
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:03,004
Am I putting too much
thought into this?

113
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:37,503
O---SO---JI!

114
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:44,785
OSOJI!

115
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,812
Suction!

116
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,135
The talisman is mine!

117
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,113
We won't let
you have that!

118
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:16,178
Who is it!?

119
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:19,619
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Uranus...

120
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:21,122
...acts with elegance!

121
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:22,123
Likewise...

122
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:24,250
...I am Sailor Neptune!

123
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:29,321
This is what I've taken!

124
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,492
I won't let you have it!

125
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,094
OSOJI...

126
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:35,335
HURRICANE!

127
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:42,669
WORLD SHAKING!

128
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:49,851
It's mine!

129
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:52,748
OSOJI!

130
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:55,747
Drat!

131
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:57,625
The crystal!!

132
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,388
Hold it right there!

133
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,429
OSOJI!

134
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:08,600
Where's the talisman?

135
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:10,601
Where is it!?

136
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:20,211
WHERE IS IT?!!

137
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:23,448
Unazuki!

138
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:25,476
I'm here with everyone!

139
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:26,886
Really...

140
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:29,948
I was wondering where you ran off to,
keeping everyone waiting...?

141
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:32,187
- Well, it's all right, thanks to Usagi...
- Oh, I want to clean...

142
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,889
- ...we'll be eating cake in the end, right?
- ...Motoki's room for him again...

143
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,761
Besides, we can study anywhere.

144
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,426
Ami, you planned to have...

145
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,628
...the study group
at Unazuki's place?

146
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,432
Was that a bad idea?

147
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:44,537
Usagi...

148
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:46,902
This is strange.

149
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:50,241
Maybe Unazuki isn't
back from her job yet.

150
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:53,075
Huh? It's open...

151
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,586
Unazuki!

152
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,741
Unazuki!

153
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:26,105
What's wrong!?

154
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:27,307
This is...!?

155
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:29,817
Her pure heart crystal
has been taken away!

156
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:34,079
If we don't follow the Daimohn fast
and get it back, Unazuki will...!

157
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:36,556
But, where should we look?

158
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:43,594
Where are you!?

159
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:46,226
Where, where, where, where,
where, where are you!?

160
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:50,331
Here it is!

161
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:53,136
It's a good thing the
tick sensor was on it!

162
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:55,903
Ami, have you
figured it out!?

163
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:58,208
Within a 10-km radius,
towards the north...

164
00:10:58,247 --> 00:11:01,444
I'm sorry, but I can't
be any more specific.

165
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:04,475
In any case, we have to
split up and look for them!

166
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,750
Everyone should keep in touch!

167
00:11:06,788 --> 00:11:08,688
Everyone have
their communicators?

168
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:09,918
Yeah.

169
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:16,789
A kiss...

170
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,291
I want to kiss!

171
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:24,436
W-What's gotten into her!?

172
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:27,702
Unazuki!
Pull yourself together!

173
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:29,711
I want to kiss!
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

174
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,212
- NO!
- Unazuki!

175
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:34,841
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

176
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:36,874
Come on,
get yourself together!

177
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:39,343
You said that your
first kiss was precious!

178
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:41,015
That you were waiting for
someone you really love!

179
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:44,321
And it would be at the best
place at the best time, right!?

180
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:47,351
Right, Unazuki!?

181
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:49,956
I don't care who!
I want to kiss!

182
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:55,162
Perhaps she became impure
because her pure heart was stolen!

183
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:57,329
Is that how it works...?

184
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:58,999
Yes, I'm sure of it!

185
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,269
EVIL SPIRITS, BEGONE!

186
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:07,982
I'll look after Unazuki!

187
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:11,508
Everyone, hurry and find the
crystal of her pure heart!

188
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,987
But...

189
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:17,548
...what in the world...

190
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:20,323
...do we use as a
clue to look for it!?

191
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:21,590
Usagi!

192
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,722
There's a Daimohn
3-km away from you!

193
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,564
Everyone, hurry over there!

194
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:29,594
Got it, Ami!

195
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:31,437
Mamo-chan!

196
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:34,101
Usako! If you're
in a hurry, get on!

197
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:48,321
Everyone!

198
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:51,485
Hurry and bring back the
crystal of her pure heart...!

199
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:54,495
At this rate,
Unazuki will die!

200
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,859
Usagi! It's in that area!

201
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:02,494
Okay!

202
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:07,537
It's in HERE!?

203
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:16,443
A Daimohn!

204
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:18,885
It's got a pure heart crystal!

205
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,320
That must be Unazuki's!

206
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:29,926
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

207
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,293
You are as pesky
as little ticks!

208
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:10,067
Cooperate and give
us the talisman!

209
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:12,403
This is what I took!

210
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:14,807
If you want it, you have
to wrestle it away from me!

211
00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:16,367
No!

212
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:19,812
I won't let ANYONE have
that pure heart crystal!

213
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:23,609
A girl who dreams of a first
kiss with a wonderful boy...!

214
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:27,783
I can't forgive you for
stealing such a pure heart!

215
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:32,191
For love and justice,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

216
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:33,819
Sailor Moon!

217
00:14:35,497 --> 00:14:38,898
In the name of the moon,
I punish you!

218
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:42,327
We have another tick!?

219
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:46,067
I can't allow
for any ticks!!

220
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:51,474
Gust of wind!

221
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,019
Shut up!

222
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:02,683
Take these
pieces of trash!

223
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:11,733
Ow...

224
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,997
I won't lose to someone like you!

225
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:20,171
Unazuki...

226
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,179
I have to save... Unazuki...

227
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:34,080
All of you,
pile up and DIE!

228
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,293
A crystal of a pure heart...

229
00:15:43,331 --> 00:15:46,232
...does not fit someone
with a soiled heart!

230
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:47,963
Return the crystal now...

231
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:50,563
...and be buried along
with this scrap metal!

232
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,300
Tuxedo Mask!

233
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:59,742
Sailor Moon! Show it
the power of justice!

234
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:01,745
Right!

235
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:29,633
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

236
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:43,755
LOVELY!

237
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:59,331
Oh, no!
The pure heart crystal...!

238
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:01,335
I won't let you have it!

239
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:06,242
We will take the talisman!

240
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:10,641
I won't let you have it!

241
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,279
Let me go!

242
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:16,722
If I don't give that back,
Unazuki is going to die!

243
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:19,593
I know that we're
going to have casualties!

244
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:21,118
Then, why...!?

245
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:23,153
It's nothing that
you would understand!

246
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:25,858
It is our duty!

247
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:29,129
We must get a hold of it!

248
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:31,934
Sailor Moon!

249
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:35,667
This is...!

250
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,538
It's not a talisman.

251
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,979
It's only a normal
pure heart crystal!

252
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:41,448
What!?

253
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:44,714
Give it back!

254
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,951
I'll never let you have it!

255
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:55,419
Do what you want with it...

256
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,128
What does this mean...?

257
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:07,737
Sailor Moon!

258
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:10,142
Sailor Moon!

259
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:14,011
Come on, let's hurry
back to Unazuki!

260
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,353
That girl who was dreaming
about her first kiss...

261
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:20,854
I wonder if
she'll be saved?

262
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:22,914
She'll probably
be all right.

263
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:25,787
Somehow...

264
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:29,889
I'm glad that it
wasn't a talisman.

265
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:31,662
What are you saying?

266
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,430
No matter what happens,
we must find the talismans!

267
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:35,731
You're right...

268
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,399
Because that is the duty
that we were given.

269
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:57,892
Unazuki's body...!

270
00:18:57,926 --> 00:18:59,223
I'm so glad!

271
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:03,729
Now she won't
kiss just anyone!

272
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:06,563
You have to kiss someone
you love, after all!

273
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:09,898
That's right!
In Italy, long ago...

274
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:15,376
...if a boy and a girl kissed,
they had to get married!

275
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:17,838
That's how
important a kiss is!

276
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,608
But, Usagi, we know
somebody who often does...

277
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:24,846
...such an important thing
with a certain someone.

278
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,954
That's right. For now,
we have to think more...

279
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:30,924
...about the entrance
exams than romance.

280
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:33,519
Now, let's begin
our study group!

281
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:37,157
You really are going
to start it here!?

282
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:38,927
I can't believe it!

283
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:40,525
If we don't start right now...

284
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:42,798
...we won't be done with
what we have to cover today!

285
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:46,205
I'm glad Unazuki
is back to normal.

286
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:49,467
Yeah. Unazuki's
cherished dream as well.

287
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,001
A first kiss...

288
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:53,412
Unazuki's dream is
a wonderful thing.

289
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:58,412
I'm kinda happy that I was able
to protect her wonderful dream.

290
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,847
I guess...

291
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:08,488
H-Hey, Mamo-chan...

292
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,998
Do you remember
our first kiss?

293
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,465
Um, that's...

294
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:18,395
Mamo-chan?

295
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:21,102
By some chance,
you don't remember...?

296
00:20:21,142 --> 00:20:22,609
A-As I was saying...

297
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:24,134
Well, that's not
worth talking about...

298
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,080
NO! A first kiss is
really important!

299
00:20:27,115 --> 00:20:29,174
The moon is really
beautiful tonight, Usako.

300
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:30,912
Mamo-chan!

301
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:37,912
