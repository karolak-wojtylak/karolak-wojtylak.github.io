00:02.149 --> 00:04.640
Well, it's true that
of the five of us...

00:04.685 --> 00:08.280
...only Minako hasn't had
her pure heart hunted.

00:08.322 --> 00:12.224
But none of us are thinking that
Minako doesn't have a pure heart!

00:12.259 --> 00:15.251
No, not at all!
So please calm down, Minako!

00:15.295 --> 00:17.763
Sheesh, who said such a thing!?

00:17.798 --> 00:20.528
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!!

00:29.000 --> 00:29.989
Hello?

00:30.034 --> 00:31.501
This is Eugeal.

00:31.536 --> 00:33.697
Actually, I'm calling because
I noticed something strange...

00:33.738 --> 00:34.966
Oh?

00:35.006 --> 00:39.568
A human shadow appeared
amongst the data for the Grail.

00:39.610 --> 00:41.202
Just as I thought...

00:41.245 --> 00:44.305
That is the user of the Grail.

00:44.682 --> 00:46.411
The user of the Grail...?

00:47.018 --> 00:48.610
Yes.

00:48.653 --> 00:52.214
If the Grail ends up in
hands that will aid us...

00:52.256 --> 00:55.919
...the world of darkness that
we long for will be completed.

00:55.960 --> 01:01.296
However, if someone who is against
our beliefs gets a hold of it...

01:03.801 --> 01:07.567
...our objective will be crushed!

01:07.605 --> 01:11.006
We must get a hold of it before
anyone else, no matter at what cost!

01:11.042 --> 01:13.101
We must!!

01:14.612 --> 01:17.911
Where is this... user of the Grail?

01:17.949 --> 01:20.941
We must first get a hold of
the Grail... See you later.

01:20.985 --> 01:22.646
By the way, Professor...

01:22.687 --> 01:25.383
You broke the phone receiver
just now, didn't you?

01:25.423 --> 01:30.019
I will have there pair costs
Deducted from your paycheck.

01:31.262 --> 01:35.722
I want the Sailor Soldiers
to pay for it...

01:45.076 --> 01:46.043
I'm done!

01:47.245 --> 01:50.612
You did it! 23 minutes!
That's a new record!

01:51.716 --> 01:55.675
These were really hard problems!
I'm so amazing!

01:55.720 --> 01:56.618
You did it!

01:56.654 --> 01:57.484
Congrats.

01:57.522 --> 01:59.353
That was pretty well-done for Usagi.

01:59.390 --> 02:01.051
Thanks!

02:01.092 --> 02:02.525
It's all thanks to you guys!

02:02.560 --> 02:03.993
Oh, wait.

02:04.729 --> 02:06.754
The calculations are off right here.

02:06.797 --> 02:10.255
So, the answer becomes... this.

02:12.136 --> 02:14.570
Why? WHY!?

02:14.605 --> 02:19.167
Usagi, you are doing what you can...
There, there...

02:19.210 --> 02:21.440
I don't wanna do this anymore!

02:21.479 --> 02:23.174
Don't cry each and every time!

02:23.214 --> 02:24.408
But...

02:24.448 --> 02:27.940
Although I said it's a mistake...
See, it's a simple one.

02:27.985 --> 02:30.180
You just have to be careful next time.

02:30.221 --> 02:32.985
I know I'm going to make a mistake
somewhere else next time!

02:33.024 --> 02:36.858
I'm sick of all of this!
I don't want to go through such pain!!

02:37.628 --> 02:39.687
So what about this much pain!?

02:39.730 --> 02:43.598
Have you forgotten about when a Daimohn
took out your pure heart crystal!?

02:43.834 --> 02:44.698
That's right.

02:44.735 --> 02:48.432
Compared to the pain we felt back then,
studying can even be thought of as fun!

02:48.773 --> 02:50.434
Let's do our best, Usagi!

02:50.775 --> 02:52.538
All right... I understand...

02:52.577 --> 02:54.875
It really was painful
back when it happened.

02:54.912 --> 02:55.571
Yeah...

02:55.613 --> 02:58.548
It felt as painful as when I chugged
down a 1.5-liter bottled soft drink!

02:58.583 --> 02:59.948
That was it!?

02:59.984 --> 03:04.011
Oh, maybe the pain was that
plus about 10 balls of rice!

03:04.055 --> 03:04.987
Yeah!

03:05.022 --> 03:07.354
I see...

03:12.129 --> 03:13.653
Something wrong?

03:13.698 --> 03:16.428
Hey, Artemis...

03:17.034 --> 03:21.334
Why do you think Daimohn
don't come after me!?

03:22.206 --> 03:27.610
Everyone other than me had the crystals
of their pure hearts sought after...

03:27.645 --> 03:29.203
Maybe you're not pure...?

03:30.181 --> 03:32.012
Oh, no, that can't possibly be it!

03:32.049 --> 03:33.710
It can't, right?

03:34.719 --> 03:37.984
Maybe because I quit playing
volleyball that I loved so much...

03:38.022 --> 03:40.217
I'm not as focused on one thing...?

03:40.825 --> 03:42.224
Are you worried about it?

03:45.062 --> 03:47.690
Not really...

04:23.000 --> 04:25.298
Usagi!

04:25.836 --> 04:27.428
I'm sorry, did I hit you?

04:27.471 --> 04:29.029
Are you all right?

04:29.073 --> 04:31.473
I'm okay, I'm all right!

04:31.509 --> 04:34.637
But enough of that.
Are YOU all right, Minako?

04:34.945 --> 04:36.640
About what?

04:36.947 --> 04:39.142
You know...

04:40.685 --> 04:43.518
You mean how I'm the only one
that Daimohn hasn't come after?

04:43.554 --> 04:46.648
Of course I'm not worried about that!

04:47.525 --> 04:49.652
Geez!

04:53.497 --> 04:54.589
Anyway you look at it...

04:54.632 --> 04:57.726
...I'm not convinced that I'm the
only one without a pure heart!

04:57.768 --> 04:59.167
Of course not!

05:04.408 --> 05:05.773
This time, for sure...

05:05.810 --> 05:07.835
Hey, are you REALLY
not worried about it?

05:07.878 --> 05:09.436
Of course not!

05:09.847 --> 05:13.180
Maybe you are thinking
too much, Artemis.

05:13.217 --> 05:17.017
That's right! Minako wouldn't be
worried about something like that...

05:17.054 --> 05:20.251
So what part of me isn't pure!?

05:20.291 --> 05:21.019
Sheesh!

05:21.058 --> 05:25.654
If they don't realize how pure I am,
the enemy really isn't that formidable.

05:25.696 --> 05:27.755
Hello?

05:28.899 --> 05:30.161
Minako...

05:30.201 --> 05:34.934
You can't possibly be considering
getting yourself targeted, right, Minako?

05:37.308 --> 05:39.674
You can't!
You absolutely can't do that!

05:39.710 --> 05:41.177
It's better if you don't.

05:41.212 --> 05:44.875
What would happen if they took
out your pure heart crystal!?

05:44.915 --> 05:47.076
If that happens,
I'll get it back myself.

05:47.118 --> 05:50.918
That's impossible!
You just CAN'T do that! Please!!

05:50.955 --> 05:53.890
I was just kidding...
Now let me... go!

05:58.662 --> 06:00.220
- You're kidding.
- You're kidding.

06:00.431 --> 06:01.796
Hey, Minako.

06:01.832 --> 06:05.097
You know, Usagi has
a pure love for Mamoru...

06:05.136 --> 06:07.764
But she has a pure love for
eating and sleeping as well.

06:07.805 --> 06:12.333
And she has a pure hatred for studying,
so she purely wants to ditch studying.

06:12.376 --> 06:15.209
But if you're saying that
THAT is a pure heart...

06:15.246 --> 06:17.771
...then you have to realize
that she's just an idiot.

06:17.815 --> 06:19.077
Thanks a lot...

06:19.417 --> 06:23.183
Even the enemy can't see through
to your true purity, Minako.

06:23.220 --> 06:26.678
As I said, I'm not
worried about it! Sheesh!

06:28.993 --> 06:30.324
Usagi...

06:30.361 --> 06:31.157
Yeah?

06:31.195 --> 06:32.685
I have a favor to ask you.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.960
What?

06:38.903 --> 06:41.371
Can you take half of these?

06:42.907 --> 06:46.001
I kinda don't want to...

07:02.760 --> 07:04.921
Let's leave her alone for a while...

07:04.962 --> 07:09.661
You're right. Considering how Minako is,
she won't do anything too irrational.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.895
You think so...?

07:12.703 --> 07:14.364
A pure heart is...

07:14.405 --> 07:16.430
A heart that deeply focuses
in on one thing at a time...

07:16.474 --> 07:19.170
That's true, Usagi is
one who concentrates on...

07:19.210 --> 07:21.906
...one thing at a time,
so much to be considered foolish.

07:21.946 --> 07:25.609
Compared to that, I think about
so many aspects of things...

07:25.649 --> 07:27.173
Maybe I'm more mature in that sense?

07:27.218 --> 07:28.742
Hey.

07:29.487 --> 07:30.749
Oh, hello.

07:35.559 --> 07:37.891
Haruka, Michiru...

07:37.928 --> 07:40.761
What do you think a pure heart is?

07:41.165 --> 07:42.632
What are you talking about?

07:42.666 --> 07:45.260
Can it be that she
knows about the talisman...!?

07:45.302 --> 07:46.030
T-

07:46.070 --> 07:46.559
T-!?

07:46.604 --> 07:47.662
T-!!?

07:48.706 --> 07:51.675
T-aking for instance,
is there something that...

07:51.709 --> 07:54.701
...someone with a pure heart
is likely to be doing?

07:55.713 --> 07:56.179
T-

07:56.213 --> 07:56.611
T-?

07:56.647 --> 07:59.946
T-ry doing something that
is for the good of others.

08:00.818 --> 08:02.445
Doing something for
the good of others!?

08:02.486 --> 08:05.455
Please help us with
the Blood Donation of Love.

08:05.489 --> 08:07.980
We currently are short
on blood for transfusion.

08:08.025 --> 08:10.892
- For instance, donating your blood...
- Thank you very much!

08:13.697 --> 08:15.562
I guess we read too much into that.

08:15.599 --> 08:17.931
Perhaps we are starting to be rushed...

08:19.203 --> 08:23.401
But, she took us seriously, although
I said that off the top of my head...

08:23.440 --> 08:25.874
A dangerous purity.

08:25.910 --> 08:28.208
Um...

08:28.712 --> 08:30.373
Take these!

08:30.414 --> 08:32.211
They're tokens of my thanks.

08:34.151 --> 08:37.245
I don't want this...

08:39.356 --> 08:42.484
Donate blood! Donate blood!
Donate blood! Donate blood!

08:42.526 --> 08:43.515
Please go ahead!

08:43.561 --> 08:46.052
Don't be bashful, you can
take as much as you want!

08:46.096 --> 08:49.065
It's for the good of others,
for the good of the world!

08:49.433 --> 08:50.491
Eugeal...

08:50.534 --> 08:52.695
Have you found a new target?

08:52.736 --> 08:53.634
Yes.

08:53.671 --> 08:57.198
The owner of a pure heart type
that I can't yet figure out...

08:57.241 --> 09:01.234
However, I feel that the Sailor Soldiers
will once again get in our way.

09:01.879 --> 09:04.780
Well then, I shall prevent their...

09:04.815 --> 09:06.248
...intrusion!

09:06.283 --> 09:11.482
I will make a Daimohn to do just that!

09:18.095 --> 09:20.120
I'm Minako Aino, and
I'm here to donate blood!

09:20.164 --> 09:22.291
I may look young, but I'm 18!

09:22.333 --> 09:24.733
So, you can go ahead and
take as much as you want!

09:27.104 --> 09:29.595
I'm doing something for
the good of others...

09:29.640 --> 09:30.971
I'm so pure...

09:31.008 --> 09:32.737
I'm TOO pure...!

09:55.099 --> 09:59.433
Yeah, and every day she lies about her age,
going from one donation area to the next!

09:59.470 --> 10:01.233
I'm surprised she's
able to keep it up...

10:01.271 --> 10:05.435
Well, just stay by her side
in case an enemy attacks her.

10:05.476 --> 10:08.104
And make sure she's
getting proper nutrition.

10:08.145 --> 10:10.204
Yeah, you're right...

10:10.547 --> 10:12.640
Donate blood! Donate blood!
Donate blood! Donate blood!

10:12.683 --> 10:14.617
I still think we should stop her...

10:14.652 --> 10:19.214
If Minako's heart crystal turns out to
be a talisman, it would be too dangerous.

10:19.623 --> 10:20.419
But...

10:20.457 --> 10:23.017
If that's the case,
she'll be targeted sooner or later...

10:23.060 --> 10:24.152
That's true...

10:24.194 --> 10:28.494
So, in the end, we have to
save her when that happens.

10:28.532 --> 10:31.000
But, thinking about this...

10:31.035 --> 10:34.994
Is Minako, who's running around donation
areas for her own pure heart, really pure?

10:36.206 --> 10:37.036
T-That's...

10:37.074 --> 10:38.632
Minako!

10:38.676 --> 10:41.406
I got you Morimorin-C and Vitavitan-A!

10:41.445 --> 10:42.742
Drink these, and do your best!

10:42.780 --> 10:44.145
Thanks!

10:48.385 --> 10:49.682
That hits the spot!

10:49.720 --> 10:51.950
She's p-pure! Minako is pure too!

10:51.989 --> 10:54.389
- Pure, pure, pure. So pure.
- Yeah, pure! She is pure.

10:57.161 --> 10:58.890
Well, off to the next spot!

11:07.604 --> 11:08.332
Captured!

11:19.683 --> 11:20.672
Minako!

11:31.328 --> 11:33.159
A pure heart...

11:33.197 --> 11:34.129
It came out!

11:34.164 --> 11:35.927
I'm glad for you, Minako...

11:35.966 --> 11:38.127
Now, hurry up and put it back inside...

11:39.503 --> 11:40.765
Impossible!

11:42.573 --> 11:45.201
Minako! Wait!

11:45.743 --> 11:46.801
Eugeal!?

11:46.844 --> 11:48.539
- What does this mean!?
- Guys, hurry!

11:48.579 --> 11:51.446
Artemis! There are
bottles at your feet!

11:52.483 --> 11:55.077
- Artemis!
- I'm sorry...

12:14.571 --> 12:16.505
W-What horribly strong mental powers...

12:17.908 --> 12:20.001
Wait!

12:20.410 --> 12:23.004
Don't come any closer to that girl!

12:23.046 --> 12:23.842
What!?

12:23.881 --> 12:25.178
How arrogant!

12:25.215 --> 12:27.911
Come out, Daimohn!!

12:29.787 --> 12:31.914
Doorknobder!

12:31.955 --> 12:37.916
When going out, one word to
your neighbor, and lock the door!

12:38.262 --> 12:39.786
Go lock up.

12:39.830 --> 12:41.422
I will go lock up!

12:51.775 --> 12:52.867
Completed!

12:52.910 --> 12:54.172
Who is it?

12:55.746 --> 12:57.179
Haruka, and Michiru too...?

12:57.514 --> 13:00.950
If you didn't stick your nose into other
people's business, you'd live longer.

13:01.518 --> 13:02.382
What should I do?

13:02.419 --> 13:04.887
If I transformed here...

13:04.922 --> 13:05.684
But...

13:08.058 --> 13:10.686
We can't possibly transform here...

13:15.732 --> 13:17.063
Hold it right there!

13:24.141 --> 13:27.599
MOON COSMIC POWER...

13:27.644 --> 13:30.044
MAKE UP!

14:00.244 --> 14:01.336
What!?

14:01.378 --> 14:02.606
So it WAS her!

14:03.881 --> 14:06.281
Wanting to cherish a pure heart...

14:06.316 --> 14:09.683
To come after the innocence of such
a maiden is something I can't forgive!

14:10.621 --> 14:12.350
For love and justice...

14:12.389 --> 14:14.516
...the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

14:18.929 --> 14:20.521
Sailor Moon!

14:21.999 --> 14:25.765
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

14:26.236 --> 14:29.069
Doorknobder, kill her!

14:29.106 --> 14:30.869
- Huh?
- Don't give me "Huh?"!

14:30.908 --> 14:33.934
I'm for locking up,
and not really good at combat...

14:33.977 --> 14:35.535
- DO IT!
- Sure.

14:35.879 --> 14:37.210
DOORKNOB RELUCTANCE ATTACK!

14:39.082 --> 14:42.074
See, you can do it if you try. Now...

14:42.119 --> 14:43.780
You can't!

14:52.796 --> 14:56.562
I can't give you that.

14:57.634 --> 15:00.034
Doorknobder, get rid of them first!

15:00.070 --> 15:01.298
RELUCTANCE ATTACK...!

15:04.241 --> 15:05.708
We have no choice.

15:05.742 --> 15:07.300
I agree.

15:07.678 --> 15:10.670
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

15:10.714 --> 15:13.114
MAKE UP!

15:14.284 --> 15:16.582
URANUS PLANET POWER...

15:16.620 --> 15:19.020
MAKE UP!

15:42.212 --> 15:45.306
Haruka... and Michiru were...

15:45.782 --> 15:47.807
Three Sailor Soldiers...!?

15:50.787 --> 15:53.278
WORLD...

15:53.323 --> 15:55.314
...SHAKING!

15:59.930 --> 16:01.261
Most unfortunate.

16:01.298 --> 16:03.823
Wait, stop that, Michiru!

16:06.203 --> 16:06.965
Please!

16:07.004 --> 16:08.835
Please return that crystal!

16:08.872 --> 16:11.306
This isn't a talisman.

16:13.210 --> 16:14.108
What!?

16:14.144 --> 16:17.045
BURNING MANDALA!

16:19.649 --> 16:22.846
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

16:24.021 --> 16:27.013
SHINE AQUA ILLUSION!

16:28.358 --> 16:31.020
There are Sailor Soldiers
outside as well!?

16:31.061 --> 16:32.289
Doorknobder!

16:32.329 --> 16:33.660
Get every last one of them!!

16:33.997 --> 16:36.659
DOORKNOB DESPARATION ATTACK!

16:40.303 --> 16:42.897
DEEP...

16:42.939 --> 16:44.236
...SUBMERGE!

16:49.112 --> 16:52.513
I told you, I'm not good at combat!!

16:52.549 --> 16:54.608
Now, Sailor Moon.

16:54.651 --> 16:55.709
Yeah.

16:59.623 --> 17:02.217
Y-You should get rid of HER first!

17:22.012 --> 17:22.979
Out of my way!

17:23.313 --> 17:27.181
MOON SPIRAL...

17:27.984 --> 17:30.544
WITCHES EUGEAL...

17:30.587 --> 17:32.077
HEA...

17:32.122 --> 17:34.420
FI...

17:34.458 --> 17:37.052
...RT ATTACK!

17:38.128 --> 17:40.892
...RE BUSTER!!

17:53.009 --> 17:55.341
LOVELY!

18:08.892 --> 18:10.883
Don't move!

18:11.495 --> 18:15.488
Even Sailor Moon's ultimate attack
was no match for this Fire Buster...

18:15.532 --> 18:18.695
...which is currently being
registered as a practical model!

18:18.735 --> 18:21.101
Now, all of you get
together into one bunch.

18:21.138 --> 18:25.507
Otherwise, I'll make a roast
out of that girl lying right there.

18:28.678 --> 18:31.670
I'll send all of you to
the afterlife in one group!

18:36.119 --> 18:36.778
What!?

18:37.454 --> 18:39.979
VENUS STAR POWER...

18:40.023 --> 18:42.423
MAKE UP!

19:02.212 --> 19:05.545
T-They're ALL Sailor Soldiers!?

19:11.087 --> 19:11.985
VENUS...

19:12.022 --> 19:13.182
...LOVE ME...

19:13.223 --> 19:15.020
...CHAIN!

19:18.261 --> 19:18.920
Dammit!

19:19.963 --> 19:21.294
Just you wait and see!

19:21.331 --> 19:23.265
I saw who you REALLY are!!

19:24.901 --> 19:27.233
Backing up!

19:33.810 --> 19:35.539
Wait!

19:36.179 --> 19:39.171
Haruka... Michiru...

19:39.282 --> 19:40.749
Please, tell me.

19:40.784 --> 19:43.048
What is your real objective?

19:43.553 --> 19:48.047
Why do you try to get the talismans,
even if it means sacrificing human lives?

19:48.525 --> 19:50.755
Don't probe where you don't have to.

19:50.794 --> 19:52.955
It's better if you don't
get too deeply involved.

19:52.996 --> 19:54.020
But...

19:54.064 --> 19:56.294
Enough!

19:57.467 --> 20:02.461
Haruka and Michiru are
Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune...!?

20:02.806 --> 20:05.536
Does that mean that
they really are enemies...?

20:05.575 --> 20:07.702
I don't want to believe that...

20:12.249 --> 20:15.218
They found out who we are.

20:15.252 --> 20:19.086
We might have been foolish
to transform back there...

20:19.122 --> 20:21.317
I don't regret it.

20:21.358 --> 20:22.620
That so?

20:22.659 --> 20:26.755
If we hadn't,
we wouldn't have survived...

20:26.796 --> 20:30.664
And I wanted to save those girls.

20:33.664 --> 20:37.664
