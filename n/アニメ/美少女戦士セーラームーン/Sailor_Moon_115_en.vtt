00:03.016 --> 00:07.146
Chibiusa, I hope you can
be friends with Hotaru.

00:07.187 --> 00:10.281
Don't worry, you're pretty
wonderful yourself.

00:10.724 --> 00:12.851
Hey, Daimohn!

00:12.893 --> 00:17.296
Big Sister won't allow you to force
your friendship on someone else!

00:18.398 --> 00:21.060
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

00:21.800 --> 00:23.825
Bye-bye! See you tomorrow!

00:23.868 --> 00:25.335
Bye-bye, Chibiusa!

00:27.105 --> 00:29.335
Small Lady...

00:31.209 --> 00:33.609
Plu!

00:34.913 --> 00:37.347
Hello, Small Lady.

00:39.751 --> 00:40.342
Plu!

00:54.065 --> 00:57.466
Plu, you never come visit to play with me.

00:57.502 --> 00:59.868
I thought that you forgot all about me!

01:00.405 --> 01:05.809
Small Lady, in this world,
my name is Setsuna Meioh.

01:05.844 --> 01:09.644
In that case, I'm Usagi, too, you know.
Call me Chibiusa!

01:09.681 --> 01:12.878
Then, I'll call you Set-chan!

01:14.786 --> 01:17.380
You are as you've always been, Small Lady.

01:18.223 --> 01:20.851
It seems that you've made a lot of friends...

01:20.892 --> 01:22.985
Is this day and age fun for you?

01:23.027 --> 01:26.554
Yeah, it's fun! Everyone is very nice to me.

01:26.598 --> 01:28.065
I see.

01:28.099 --> 01:32.195
I'm sure Neo Queen Serenity
sent you to this particular era...

01:32.237 --> 01:36.674
...because she wanted you to
make many friends as a normal girl.

01:37.542 --> 01:43.242
I'm sure it will all be of help to you in
the future, when you become the Queen.

01:43.281 --> 01:44.805
Hey, Plu...

01:47.085 --> 01:50.418
I can see you whenever I
want to from now on, right?

01:51.523 --> 01:52.581
Really?

01:53.024 --> 01:55.356
Yes... I promise you.

01:55.793 --> 01:57.522
Okay!

01:57.562 --> 02:01.123
If I don't get home soon,
Mama-Ikuko will be worried.

02:01.165 --> 02:02.462
Yes...

02:02.500 --> 02:04.263
Bye-bye, Plu!

02:09.307 --> 02:13.004
"I can see you whenever I
want to from now on, right, Plu?"

02:13.044 --> 02:14.341
How cute...

02:14.379 --> 02:19.373
But to think that little one is the
Princess who came from the future...

02:19.417 --> 02:23.353
Small Lady is the official heir to
the throne of the Silver Millennium.

02:24.489 --> 02:28.220
Yeah. I'll at least try to be
careful and not hurt her.

02:28.259 --> 02:31.592
Anyway, we have to find the
Messiah as soon as possible.

02:32.530 --> 02:34.555
The Grail has appeared.

02:34.599 --> 02:38.102
To prevent the silence,
we must make sure that...

02:38.102 --> 02:41.629
...it lands in the hands of
the holy messiah at any cost.

02:42.340 --> 02:45.241
They are still collecting pure hearts.

02:45.276 --> 02:49.212
If that's for them to awaken
the messiah as one of evil...

02:49.681 --> 02:53.208
We must work to deal with that.

02:53.785 --> 02:55.719
The Messiah of Silence...

02:56.254 --> 02:59.246
...must not be born at any cost!

03:00.725 --> 03:05.253
I'm sorry... I can't continue
lying to you anymore...

03:05.296 --> 03:07.230
I can't be with you anymore.

03:07.265 --> 03:08.960
Please forgive me.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.465
Why...!? I love you so much...!

03:12.904 --> 03:17.238
I'm sorry...
But I just can't forget about her...

03:17.575 --> 03:18.633
Impossible!

03:18.676 --> 03:20.610
I'm sorry, Hanako...

03:20.645 --> 03:25.241
I won't forgive you, Yuu! You have me!
What's this about Hanako!?

03:25.283 --> 03:28.309
Who is that woman!?

03:28.353 --> 03:31.720
Yes, Mimet here! I'm currently busy...

03:31.756 --> 03:34.247
It's me.

03:35.193 --> 03:36.251
Oh, Professor!

03:36.861 --> 03:39.659
How studious of you to
be so busy right now.

03:39.697 --> 03:42.894
So, I can get the name
of the next target, right?

03:42.934 --> 03:44.993
Yes, leave it to me.

03:45.036 --> 03:47.402
I'm counting on you, Mimet.

03:47.438 --> 03:51.033
Yuu Kazama... You are so cute that
this hatred grows a hundred fold!

03:51.075 --> 03:54.374
I'll take your pure heart!

03:57.482 --> 03:59.279
Oh, no!

04:00.485 --> 04:03.818
I want to make this world mine quickly.

04:03.855 --> 04:07.814
I want to make this world
beautiful with my own hands.

04:07.859 --> 04:10.293
Please wait a little while longer.

04:15.066 --> 04:19.298
Pure hearts...
Give me pure hearts quickly...

04:21.472 --> 04:23.463
Pure hearts...

04:27.011 --> 04:29.070
This again...

04:29.914 --> 04:32.644
What have I been doing?

04:32.684 --> 04:36.313
It's always like this after a bad seizure.

04:38.222 --> 04:41.419
Hey, Luna-P, don't move.

04:51.335 --> 04:53.030
Is Hotaru here?

04:53.071 --> 04:55.005
Hotaru is currently resting.

04:55.506 --> 04:58.737
I'm sorry, especially because
you took the time to come here.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.392
Kaori...

05:23.868 --> 05:25.893
It seemed like someone was here just now.

05:26.370 --> 05:28.565
That girl who's always here was here.

05:28.606 --> 05:29.573
And...?

05:29.607 --> 05:32.167
Of course, I had her go back.

05:32.210 --> 05:34.770
Why do you do that without asking!?

05:35.213 --> 05:37.545
Hotaru.

05:38.616 --> 05:41.050
Don't you think you are
acting a little too selfishly?

05:41.085 --> 05:45.249
Because your father is nice, I'm sure
he's letting you do whatever you want.

05:45.289 --> 05:50.784
But you, of all people, should know that your
body doesn't let you play around so much!

05:51.329 --> 05:54.230
Such a scary face.

05:56.367 --> 06:00.167
I wonder what's wrong with Hotaru...

06:01.506 --> 06:02.939
I wonder if she's all right?

06:10.915 --> 06:13.349
Chibiusa!

06:14.085 --> 06:16.417
Hotaru!

06:17.488 --> 06:18.386
Are you all right?

06:18.422 --> 06:21.949
I'm glad... I finally found you.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.460
Hotaru, you look like you're in pain.

06:27.732 --> 06:29.825
I'm sorry about earlier.

06:29.867 --> 06:35.464
Did Kaori say something mean to you?
I was just worried about that...

06:35.706 --> 06:36.968
Hotaru!

06:37.008 --> 06:38.339
Hotaru!

06:39.143 --> 06:40.132
I'm sorry...

06:40.178 --> 06:41.543
Hotaru!

06:41.579 --> 06:43.171
Hotaru!!

06:43.214 --> 06:44.511
Hotaru!

06:44.549 --> 06:45.607
That's...?

06:45.650 --> 06:47.379
Chibiusa...?

06:47.418 --> 06:48.942
Chibiusa!

06:49.754 --> 06:50.652
What's wrong!?

06:50.688 --> 06:51.655
Usagi!

06:51.689 --> 06:52.849
Hotaru!

06:52.890 --> 06:56.986
Usagi! Save Hotaru!
Come on, Usagi!

06:57.628 --> 06:58.959
Chibiusa...

06:58.996 --> 07:00.987
Hotaru...

07:01.032 --> 07:02.966
Hotaru is...!!

07:04.502 --> 07:06.629
Chibiusa, calm down.

07:06.671 --> 07:07.968
Ami...

07:08.005 --> 07:11.463
My mother's hospital is nearby.
Let's take Hotaru there.

07:25.356 --> 07:26.721
Hotaru...

07:27.925 --> 07:32.760
If I didn't go visit your house,
this wouldn't have happened...

07:32.797 --> 07:34.128
It's all my fault...

07:34.165 --> 07:36.224
That's not true.

07:36.767 --> 07:40.726
You are a dear friend for Hotaru as well...

07:40.771 --> 07:43.638
That's why she overexerted
herself to come see you.

07:43.674 --> 07:46.768
That's why you should be
at her side now, Chibiusa...

07:46.811 --> 07:50.076
That way, Hotaru will be relieved, too.

07:50.114 --> 07:52.014
She will be all right!

08:08.266 --> 08:11.827
Who did this to my goldfish...?

08:11.869 --> 08:12.858
Who...?

08:12.904 --> 08:16.032
Oh, my, you're saying strange things...

08:16.340 --> 08:19.901
This is something you did yourself.

08:19.944 --> 08:22.037
Please hurry and clean it up.

08:23.481 --> 08:25.449
I don't know about it!

08:26.517 --> 08:28.246
Good morning...

08:35.960 --> 08:37.325
What's wrong?

08:37.361 --> 08:40.262
Did you get hurt? Are you all right?

08:43.167 --> 08:44.862
What's wrong?

08:44.902 --> 08:47.928
She's the one who injured him.
That's so mean to ask what's wrong.

08:47.972 --> 08:49.530
She's really scary.

08:49.573 --> 08:52.303
She acts all prim and proper at school, too.

08:56.847 --> 08:58.144
I...

08:58.182 --> 09:01.310
Apparently, I hurt another friend again.

09:01.552 --> 09:05.579
But, I really don't remember any of it.

09:05.923 --> 09:07.914
It's all right, Hotaru.

09:07.959 --> 09:08.948
Calm down.

09:08.993 --> 09:10.824
You're not the bad one.

09:10.861 --> 09:13.887
You're not bad at all.

09:13.931 --> 09:17.833
I'm not able to make any friends!

09:17.868 --> 09:21.395
There's a different person
hiding inside of me...

09:21.439 --> 09:24.101
The part of me that hurts
the people I care about...

09:32.383 --> 09:34.476
Mother will be coming by soon.

09:34.919 --> 09:36.147
I'm glad.

09:36.687 --> 09:40.145
It seems like her seizure has been
settled down. It's all right now...

10:26.470 --> 10:27.937
Hotaru.

10:29.607 --> 10:31.438
Chibiusa...

10:32.676 --> 10:34.940
Hotaru! You shouldn't get up yet!

10:36.447 --> 10:37.880
I'm fine...

10:37.915 --> 10:39.678
You don't hurt anywhere?

10:42.219 --> 10:43.686
You're not in pain at all?

10:46.123 --> 10:48.318
I'm glad...

10:48.359 --> 10:50.350
I'm so glad!

10:55.066 --> 10:57.591
Chibiusa...

11:02.473 --> 11:04.941
How is it? Feeling any better?

11:04.975 --> 11:06.203
Yes.

11:06.644 --> 11:08.703
I think you should lie
down for a while longer...

11:08.746 --> 11:11.977
I'm all right. It's just one
of my regular seizures...

11:12.016 --> 11:14.246
Are you really all right?

11:14.285 --> 11:16.048
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

11:16.087 --> 11:18.749
My mother, a doctor, will be here soon.

11:18.789 --> 11:19.949
I'm sorry...

11:19.990 --> 11:26.122
My family has strictly told me that I can't
have any outside doctors take a look at me.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.391
So I'll go home now.

11:27.431 --> 11:31.424
I'll see you later, Chibiusa. Thank you.

11:32.369 --> 11:33.961
I'll walk you back.

11:35.539 --> 11:39.066
I really thank you very much...

11:40.377 --> 11:41.901
Hotaru.

11:42.313 --> 11:46.409
The hotcakes that my mom
makes are really yummy.

11:47.017 --> 11:49.952
Come visit us next time.
We'll treat you to them!

11:49.987 --> 11:50.681
Sure!

11:54.258 --> 11:55.691
That's a promise!

11:58.896 --> 12:00.420
Little one!

12:00.831 --> 12:01.957
Haruka...

12:01.999 --> 12:03.432
Yo!

12:03.934 --> 12:05.799
Where are you going?

12:05.836 --> 12:07.428
If you want, I'll give you a ride...

12:10.808 --> 12:13.003
Thank you, Haruka...

12:13.043 --> 12:14.442
This is the right road?

12:14.979 --> 12:15.946
Yes.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.447
What's your name?

12:18.082 --> 12:19.447
My name is Hotaru Tomoe.

12:20.151 --> 12:23.120
By any chance, are you
Professor Soichi Tomoe's daughter?

12:23.154 --> 12:24.212
Yes...

12:24.255 --> 12:25.449
I see...

12:27.825 --> 12:29.452
Hotaru...

12:29.493 --> 12:31.120
Can I come visit your place again...?

12:32.530 --> 12:34.623
Would it be bad? Am I just a nuisance?

12:35.332 --> 12:37.800
No, you're not a nuisance...

12:38.435 --> 12:40.062
I was really happy that you came.

12:40.104 --> 12:41.401
Really?

12:41.438 --> 12:42.871
Yeah...

12:42.907 --> 12:45.068
I'm glad.

12:54.285 --> 12:56.753
Yuu Kazama?

12:57.154 --> 13:00.248
You're Yuu Kazama from
"Jump Out Friends," right?

13:00.791 --> 13:01.758
Yeah...

13:02.226 --> 13:03.887
It IS you!

13:03.928 --> 13:07.625
I'm so thrilled!
I'm a huge fan of yours!

13:07.665 --> 13:08.256
I see...

13:08.832 --> 13:13.166
Actually, I have a question I want to ask you...

13:13.437 --> 13:16.770
I have a friend over there
that is a HUGE fan of yours.

13:16.807 --> 13:18.775
Can we spare a minute of your time?

13:19.243 --> 13:20.335
You know...

13:20.377 --> 13:22.971
- Please, just an autograph!!
- W-Wait a minute...

13:30.421 --> 13:32.389
Right now... the wind was rustling...

13:32.423 --> 13:33.253
Over there...

13:33.791 --> 13:35.486
Is something wrong?

13:35.859 --> 13:40.296
I'm sorry... I'm getting a little thirsty.
I'll go buy something over at that park.

13:40.331 --> 13:42.322
Okay...

13:43.167 --> 13:44.259
Can it be?

13:45.002 --> 13:47.368
Hotaru...
Can you wait here just for a minute?

13:50.474 --> 13:55.935
You know, I'm troubled by things like this.
Where is this friend of yours?

13:56.547 --> 13:58.174
Actually, right here...

13:58.482 --> 13:59.949
Are you mocking me?

14:00.117 --> 14:03.109
It's your fault... for finding another woman...

14:04.722 --> 14:06.849
You two-timer!

14:08.125 --> 14:10.855
Appear, Daimohn!

14:19.003 --> 14:21.198
Utomodachi!

14:21.238 --> 14:22.170
A monster!

14:22.206 --> 14:25.471
Let's spread this friendship to the world!

14:27.244 --> 14:29.644
I want to be friends with you forever...

14:29.680 --> 14:30.772
H-Hold on...

14:30.814 --> 14:34.716
So... give me your pure heart!

14:40.991 --> 14:42.515
Who is it!?

14:45.095 --> 14:49.191
You can't win over a man's heart by force.

14:53.037 --> 14:55.528
A Sailor Soldier!

14:55.572 --> 14:57.233
Just as I thought...

14:58.542 --> 15:02.171
Everyone, a Daimohn has appeared
at the park in the fourth block!

15:03.914 --> 15:05.176
Got it!

15:05.616 --> 15:06.514
All right!

15:06.550 --> 15:08.450
MOON PRISM POWER...

15:08.485 --> 15:10.180
MAKE UP!

15:20.464 --> 15:21.488
Utomodachi!

15:21.532 --> 15:24.524
Make her one of your friends, too!

15:24.568 --> 15:26.866
Everyone is friendly to each other,
they're all a happy family!

15:26.904 --> 15:28.371
Hey, Daimohn!

15:28.405 --> 15:29.929
That's enough of that!

15:32.443 --> 15:33.808
For love and justice...

15:33.844 --> 15:37.041
...an apprentice to a pretty
soldier in a sailor suit!

15:37.081 --> 15:39.311
Sailor Chibi Moon!

15:39.350 --> 15:41.716
In the name of the future moon...

15:41.752 --> 15:43.947
...I'll punish you!

15:44.421 --> 15:45.581
That was perfect!

15:45.622 --> 15:47.954
Idiot! Don't come over to a place like this!

15:48.425 --> 15:49.449
Idiot!?

15:49.493 --> 15:52.485
You want to be my friend, too?

15:52.529 --> 15:54.520
You silly girl you...

15:55.399 --> 15:57.959
Little girl, jump right in!

16:01.071 --> 16:03.437
This is off-limits to kids!

16:03.474 --> 16:05.169
I'm a soldier, too!

16:05.709 --> 16:09.167
But we seem to be in trouble...
Is it my fault?

16:14.918 --> 16:16.681
This again...

16:17.521 --> 16:20.115
Don't be shy and be my friend!

16:20.157 --> 16:21.522
Who would!?

16:22.893 --> 16:24.520
Hold it right there!

16:26.163 --> 16:29.929
A bad guy who hasn't given
up and is after pure hearts!

16:32.736 --> 16:34.169
For love and justice!

16:34.705 --> 16:36.172
The Sailor Team!

16:36.540 --> 16:38.474
In the name of the moon...

16:38.509 --> 16:39.669
...we'll punish you!

16:39.910 --> 16:43.004
More interruptions! Utomodachi!

16:43.046 --> 16:44.673
I'm leaving the rest to you!

16:44.715 --> 16:46.182
Lady Mimet!!

16:51.388 --> 16:56.018
I was going to be a good friend
with you, too! That's it! I quit!

16:57.361 --> 16:59.955
You guys...

17:01.064 --> 17:03.692
...I hate all of you!

17:06.270 --> 17:09.000
What is that...?

17:09.406 --> 17:10.236
Oh, no!

17:10.274 --> 17:13.300
Hotaru is over there!

17:18.749 --> 17:20.876
Out of the way, out of the way!

17:22.553 --> 17:23.645
Out of the way, out of the way!

17:29.193 --> 17:31.252
My body doesn't move...

17:31.295 --> 17:33.229
What in the world are you...!?

17:38.068 --> 17:39.092
T-This is...!?

17:44.775 --> 17:46.140
Hotaru!

17:46.176 --> 17:47.200
Sailor Moon!

17:49.613 --> 17:51.774
CRISIS...

17:51.815 --> 17:54.215
MAKE UP!

18:22.246 --> 18:25.773
RAINBOW...

18:25.816 --> 18:27.374
...MOON...

18:27.417 --> 18:31.046
...HEARTACHE!

18:43.033 --> 18:45.661
Love-Lovely!!

18:59.249 --> 19:00.841
Hotaru...

19:01.151 --> 19:02.846
Hotaru! Hold yourself together!

19:03.453 --> 19:05.887
Hotaru...

19:06.623 --> 19:07.851
Chibiusa.

19:08.392 --> 19:10.121
Are you all right?

19:13.597 --> 19:16.623
You shouldn't see me anymore...

19:17.067 --> 19:20.867
At this rate, I'm sure I'll hurt you, Chibiusa.

19:20.904 --> 19:22.371
Why?

19:23.473 --> 19:24.872
I'm sorry...

19:25.509 --> 19:26.441
I'm sorry!

19:26.476 --> 19:27.636
Hotaru!

19:33.584 --> 19:34.846
Sailor Moon.

19:34.885 --> 19:35.874
Yes?

19:35.919 --> 19:37.784
It's better to keep the little one...

19:37.821 --> 19:39.652
...away from that girl for a while.

19:39.690 --> 19:41.555
What do you mean by that?

19:44.861 --> 19:47.329
Just make sure it gets through to her!

19:47.664 --> 19:49.097
What does she mean by that!?

19:49.132 --> 19:51.430
She's not a bad girl!

19:51.468 --> 19:54.096
I wonder if it has something
to do with our enemy...?

19:54.137 --> 19:55.331
I don't know...

20:02.746 --> 20:04.373
Hotaru.

20:04.414 --> 20:06.348
Chibiusa.

20:06.383 --> 20:09.614
It would be nice if you could be
friends with that wonderful girl.

20:09.653 --> 20:13.851
It's all right, Chibiusa,
we're behind you, too!

20:14.191 --> 20:18.855
What's most important is the honest
feeling that you want to be friends with her!

20:19.463 --> 20:20.487
Yeah!

20:20.530 --> 20:22.998
All right, I'm going to do my best!

20:23.033 --> 20:26.525
Next time, I'll go say hello to her father!

20:26.570 --> 20:30.597
- Hey, I'll go with you.
- Me, too! Me, too!

20:33.597 --> 20:37.597
