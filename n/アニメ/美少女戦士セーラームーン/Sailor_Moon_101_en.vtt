WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:03.792
It's almost my birthday!

00:03.835 --> 00:06.326
I wonder what Mamo-chan will
get me as a birthday gift!

00:06.371 --> 00:09.636
I want wonderful
glass slippers...

00:09.674 --> 00:11.733
But, but you over there!

00:11.776 --> 00:14.711
The Daimohn that completely
ruins such an important day!

00:14.746 --> 00:19.513
I, Sailor Moon, will punish
you in the name of the moon!

00:27.800 --> 00:29.237
Kaorinite...

00:30.200 --> 00:33.328
Have you found
our new target?

00:33.904 --> 00:37.169
Yes... I'm sure
of it this time.

00:37.207 --> 00:40.734
Oh, is that really so?

00:40.777 --> 00:45.805
This time we have someone with
a heart of unbelievable purity.

00:46.349 --> 00:49.318
I declare it to be a
talisman without mistake.

00:49.720 --> 00:54.589
I see... Then I will hand
you the best Daimohn I have.

01:15.045 --> 01:19.448
You're the only one I
can count on, Kaorinite.

01:19.516 --> 01:21.916
Thank you very much.

01:33.263 --> 01:39.395
Today, June 30,
is my BIRTHDAY!

01:41.838 --> 01:43.237
Congrats.

01:43.273 --> 01:44.934
That's great...

01:44.975 --> 01:48.274
Oh, you had a
birthday too, Usagi?

01:48.879 --> 01:51.973
Let's try to act
our age from now on.

01:52.415 --> 01:56.511
W-What coldhearted
people they are!

02:03.460 --> 02:05.451
W-W-W-Wait a minute!

02:05.495 --> 02:07.690
Is that all you
have to say?

02:07.731 --> 02:09.062
That's it!

02:09.099 --> 02:11.067
Even if it's your
birthday today...

02:11.101 --> 02:14.264
...don't be late for
our study group at 4:00 PM!

02:14.304 --> 02:16.272
See ya!

02:16.306 --> 02:18.206
T-T-This can't be happening...

02:18.241 --> 02:20.971
You guys are all so cruel!

02:31.721 --> 02:34.918
Wow, they're beautiful!

02:39.229 --> 02:41.026
They're so nice...

02:41.064 --> 02:46.195
I wish someone would give me such
beautiful shoes as a birthday gift...

02:50.674 --> 02:52.335
I know!

03:00.851 --> 03:05.720
It's the prince who naturally brings
Cinderella her glass slipper!

03:06.790 --> 03:10.157
I'll have my prince
buy it for me!

03:18.201 --> 03:19.361
Oh...

03:22.839 --> 03:25.307
Mamo-chan!

03:25.342 --> 03:27.469
Hey! What are you
doing all of a sudden?

03:28.778 --> 03:31.975
Mamo-chan, I've been looking
around for you for a long time!

03:32.015 --> 03:33.880
Oh... Why is that?

03:33.950 --> 03:36.350
"Why?" he asks.

03:36.386 --> 03:39.116
Mamo-chan is pretending
he's clueless...

03:39.155 --> 03:41.350
I guess what people
really need after all...

03:41.391 --> 03:43.382
...are lovers and
not close friends.

03:43.994 --> 03:48.658
Mamo-chan, I want
something as my gift.

03:49.933 --> 03:55.064
If I'm getting something from
a prince, I want glass slippers.

03:55.672 --> 03:59.369
They're at the glass sculpture shop
on the corner of the third block.

03:59.409 --> 04:01.309
Please, buy them,
buy them, buy them for me!

04:01.378 --> 04:03.346
We can go
together right now!

04:03.980 --> 04:07.245
I see... It must be those
glass slippers after all.

04:09.185 --> 04:12.518
Come on, Christmas is
still a while off.

04:12.555 --> 04:14.216
Of course it is!

04:14.291 --> 04:16.885
Mamo-chan, don't you know
what day it is today?!

04:17.460 --> 04:20.395
Today? What's today?

04:21.598 --> 04:22.895
You're kidding!

04:24.267 --> 04:26.098
I'm kidding... I'm just joking.

04:26.136 --> 04:28.900
I wouldn't forget an
important day like this.

04:30.073 --> 04:32.041
Of course you
wouldn't, Mamo-chan!

04:32.976 --> 04:36.571
Right... I know! It's the
day we first met, right, Usako?

04:42.519 --> 04:45.181
It isn't, you blockhead!

04:47.123 --> 04:49.421
W-What's up with that?

05:02.539 --> 05:04.803
What's wrong, buns?

05:05.375 --> 05:08.037
Tears don't look
good on you. Here...

05:08.845 --> 05:10.642
Thank you.

05:20.557 --> 05:22.889
I see, so that's
what happened.

05:22.926 --> 05:25.520
Mamoru forgot
his girlfriend's birthday...

05:25.562 --> 05:28.224
He has some nerve.

05:28.264 --> 05:31.358
He's not my boyfriend
or anything anymore!

05:31.401 --> 05:34.632
Oh, then does that mean
I have a chance now?

05:38.208 --> 05:40.335
There you go again, Haruka.

05:40.810 --> 05:42.107
I'm not kidding...

05:42.145 --> 05:44.306
I am rather fond
of you, buns-head.

05:45.148 --> 05:47.343
Well, um, er...

05:48.084 --> 05:49.574
Oh, that's right!

05:49.619 --> 05:52.144
I have to go
to Rei's place!

05:52.222 --> 05:53.120
Bye!

05:56.726 --> 05:58.853
She really is cute.

05:59.262 --> 06:02.823
But a girl like that might
be the owner of a talisman.

06:03.633 --> 06:05.328
I-Impossible...

06:13.676 --> 06:15.234
Yes, Hino residence.

06:15.278 --> 06:17.303
Oh, Mamoru?

06:17.347 --> 06:19.281
Usagi isn't here yet.

06:19.349 --> 06:21.943
I see... I don't
really know why...

06:21.985 --> 06:24.249
...but I seem to
have upset Usako.

06:24.287 --> 06:26.847
I see.
That's what's going on...

06:27.657 --> 06:30.956
Sheesh. You were
always like this, Mamoru!

06:30.994 --> 06:33.554
You don't understand
how a woman feels!

06:34.230 --> 06:36.061
W-What do you mean by that?

06:36.599 --> 06:38.965
Today is Usagi's
birthday, you know.

06:39.936 --> 06:43.565
I see now. So that's
why Usako was so upset.

06:55.318 --> 06:59.379
Maybe I did do something
bad to Mamo-chan...

07:11.501 --> 07:13.992
Sorry. Did I keep you all waiting?

07:15.939 --> 07:17.998
Happy Birthday!

07:20.643 --> 07:23.544
Now, now, the main guest
should sit down. Sit.

07:23.580 --> 07:27.448
Eat up! I made these
the best I could!

07:28.084 --> 07:31.053
Here you go, Usagi.
A gift from us.

07:31.087 --> 07:33.487
A set of problems
often seen on exams.

07:33.990 --> 07:36.015
T-Thanks...

07:36.092 --> 07:40.426
What's this? We held a
surprise party for you...

07:40.463 --> 07:43.296
...so can't you be at least
a little bit livelier?

07:43.366 --> 07:45.891
Y-Yeah, you're right.

07:45.935 --> 07:50.031
Today we can forget about
studying and really party!

07:50.073 --> 07:52.803
Yeah, yeah! Let's go
all-out and party!

07:52.876 --> 07:54.707
It's just for today, guys.

07:55.778 --> 07:57.575
Ami, you're so...!

07:57.614 --> 08:01.015
Now, now...
Let's have a drink first.

08:02.218 --> 08:06.484
I really did want a
gift from Mamo-chan, too...

08:08.391 --> 08:10.825
Let's see,
the third block...

08:32.415 --> 08:34.246
This should do it...

08:35.852 --> 08:37.251
Welcome!

08:37.287 --> 08:40.779
Excuse me. Can I have
these glass slippers?

08:40.857 --> 08:42.848
Sure, right away...

08:46.362 --> 08:47.727
That's...?!

08:52.068 --> 08:54.400
I'm sure that was Kaorinite.

08:54.470 --> 08:57.530
Yeah... The target this
time might be that guy.

09:05.415 --> 09:07.508
Congrats, Usagi!

09:09.319 --> 09:11.651
What's wrong?
You don't look very cheerful...

09:11.721 --> 09:16.283
Y-Yeah... I slapped
Mamo-chan across the cheek.

09:18.194 --> 09:22.688
It was sorta spontaneous, but
I just couldn't forgive him...

09:22.732 --> 09:27.192
You're saying Mamoru forgot that
today was your birthday, right?

09:27.237 --> 09:31.503
But, Usagi, Mamoru didn't
forget. He never knew.

09:33.042 --> 09:36.773
Usagi, did you ever tell
Mamoru when your birthday was?

09:38.047 --> 09:41.278
Come to think of it,
I never told him!

09:41.884 --> 09:44.284
B-But, but, if you
really love each other...

09:44.320 --> 09:46.254
...you'd realize
things like that!

09:47.190 --> 09:50.853
Then, do you know
Mamoru's birthday, Usagi?

09:50.893 --> 09:54.488
Of course I do!
Let's see...

09:54.530 --> 09:59.297
October 10 is Sports Day
and December 25 is Christmas...

10:01.204 --> 10:03.138
I don't know! Sorry!

10:05.008 --> 10:07.340
I'm going to go
apologize to Mamo-chan.

10:19.856 --> 10:20.948
Mamo-chan!

10:21.024 --> 10:22.685
Usako!

10:25.428 --> 10:27.521
I'm sorry, Mamo-chan!

10:27.563 --> 10:30.054
I have been looking
for you, Princess...

10:30.600 --> 10:34.001
Now, let's check to see
if it's the correct size...

10:36.072 --> 10:37.801
M-Mamo-chan...

10:38.374 --> 10:40.171
Thank you.

10:46.883 --> 10:48.282
What is it?!

10:56.192 --> 10:58.660
SENISHENTA!

11:32.495 --> 11:37.057
I will take your pure heart
that cares about that guy-SHENTA!

11:39.435 --> 11:41.960
W-What does this all mean?!

11:43.873 --> 11:45.397
Usako!

11:45.475 --> 11:47.466
Get out of the way-SHENTA!

11:48.177 --> 11:49.610
Mamo-chan!

11:52.281 --> 11:53.578
N-No!

11:53.616 --> 11:55.846
No, no, no, no, no, NO!

11:55.885 --> 11:58.115
Come on, behave-SHENTA...

11:59.155 --> 12:00.417
In this case...

12:00.490 --> 12:03.789
MOON COSMIC POWER...MAKE--

12:08.197 --> 12:10.563
You tried to punch
me with THAT?!

12:10.600 --> 12:13.592
You are a tremendously
dangerous person-SHENTA!

12:13.669 --> 12:15.398
My transformation brooch...!

12:23.413 --> 12:25.108
What is this...?!

12:25.148 --> 12:27.946
Now you can't
fight back-SHENTA!

12:32.422 --> 12:33.946
Buns-head...

12:33.990 --> 12:36.117
...was the target this time?

12:43.833 --> 12:45.232
Don't worry-SHENTA!

12:45.268 --> 12:47.862
All I'll do is take out
your pure heart-SHENTA!

12:51.007 --> 12:52.998
NO!

12:59.749 --> 13:02.718
Uranus, shouldn't we help her?

13:03.052 --> 13:07.921
Well... She might be the
owner of the talisman.

13:08.424 --> 13:09.391
Oh?

13:09.459 --> 13:11.359
It's written all
over your face.

13:11.394 --> 13:13.521
What should you do if
that really is the case?

13:13.563 --> 13:15.292
Don't be ridiculous!

13:15.398 --> 13:16.831
Neptune!

13:20.169 --> 13:24.105
Oh, this must be the light
of a talisman-SHENTA!

13:25.174 --> 13:27.005
You're kidding...

13:27.410 --> 13:30.504
It is different from all
the previous glimmers.

13:30.546 --> 13:32.207
What are you
going to do?

13:32.248 --> 13:34.216
If it is a talisman,
we'll take it, of course!

13:34.250 --> 13:35.410
Wait!

13:36.085 --> 13:38.110
That's not what I mean!

13:40.289 --> 13:42.883
If that really is a talisman...

13:42.959 --> 13:45.359
...then you won't
return it to her, right?

13:45.862 --> 13:47.261
Y-Yeah...

13:47.296 --> 13:49.992
Then that also means
that girl's death.

14:12.221 --> 14:13.381
What's...?

14:17.293 --> 14:18.817
Who is it-SHENTA?!

14:19.795 --> 14:21.763
A pure heart
is a ray of light...

14:21.797 --> 14:23.492
...that brightens the
darkness of the night.

14:23.533 --> 14:27.128
I will make sure to protect
the glimmer of the pure heart!!

14:29.372 --> 14:30.339
Take this!

14:34.544 --> 14:36.102
Speak to me!

14:37.813 --> 14:39.440
Let's go!

14:40.383 --> 14:43.113
Dammit, where are
you going-SHENTA?

14:44.453 --> 14:47.149
Usako... You should transform
into Sailor Moon as well.

14:47.456 --> 14:49.117
Uh, about that...

14:51.260 --> 14:53.990
Senishenta...
What happened to that girl?

14:54.030 --> 14:56.965
Actually, we've had
an unexpected disturbance.

14:56.999 --> 14:59.263
You idiot!
Look for her immediately!

14:59.302 --> 15:02.066
Yes, I will look for
her immediately-SHENTA!

15:06.142 --> 15:07.575
This is...

15:10.446 --> 15:13.142
Can that girl be...?!

15:13.182 --> 15:15.047
Uh-oh, this is bad...

15:15.084 --> 15:17.848
We can't do anything about it.
We should retreat for now.

15:17.887 --> 15:20.014
But, my transformation brooch...!

15:20.056 --> 15:22.547
Now isn't the time to
be saying such things.

15:22.592 --> 15:24.992
The person that
they're after is YOU.

15:25.027 --> 15:26.756
O-Okay...

15:28.164 --> 15:29.631
I'm sorry, Usako...

15:29.665 --> 15:33.726
It's all my fault that you're
in this dangerous situation.

15:33.769 --> 15:35.794
T-That's not true...

15:35.838 --> 15:38.739
Come on, Tuxedo Mask, let's hurry!

15:38.774 --> 15:39.832
Yeah...

15:41.010 --> 15:42.705
There they are-SHENTA!

15:42.778 --> 15:43.938
You found them?!

15:43.980 --> 15:45.038
Yes!

15:45.081 --> 15:45.809
Follow them!

15:45.848 --> 15:47.213
Yes!!

15:49.318 --> 15:51.013
Looks like
they've found us...

15:59.929 --> 16:02.762
Tuxedo Mask, please
leave me here and run!

16:02.798 --> 16:04.993
I'm sure that
I got in your way...

16:05.034 --> 16:06.626
...and let them find us!

16:06.669 --> 16:08.933
- That's not true!
- B-But...

16:33.796 --> 16:35.354
You should give up.

16:35.398 --> 16:37.832
I won't let you
run away anywhere.

16:42.872 --> 16:44.897
I know! Luna!
Help me, Luna!

16:54.717 --> 16:57.743
It's no use trying to call
your friends here, Sailor Moon.

17:04.293 --> 17:06.818
Are you sure about this, Uranus?

17:06.962 --> 17:09.055
Yeah. It's okay...

17:09.999 --> 17:13.093
Our mission is to collect
the three talismans...

17:13.135 --> 17:15.035
...and get a hold
of the Holy Grail.

17:15.071 --> 17:18.768
For that purpose, a little
sacrifice is unavoidable.

17:20.543 --> 17:21.737
Uranus...

17:22.311 --> 17:26.475
Should we really have
eaten all of Usagi's cake?

17:27.249 --> 17:28.978
It's all right! It is!

17:29.051 --> 17:31.713
I'm sure she made up
with Mamoru by now.

17:33.756 --> 17:35.553
I'm jealous.

17:35.591 --> 17:37.354
Me, too.

17:37.393 --> 17:40.328
I can't quite solve
this equation...

17:43.532 --> 17:44.999
Everyone, we have a problem!

17:45.768 --> 17:47.395
What's the trouble, Luna?

17:47.436 --> 17:49.404
Something must have
happened to Usagi!

17:49.438 --> 17:50.530
Everyone, it's time to act!

17:50.573 --> 17:53.041
- All right! Let's go, everyone!
- Right!

17:59.215 --> 18:00.648
Stand back, Usako.

18:00.683 --> 18:02.651
Tuxedo Mask...

18:02.985 --> 18:05.886
When they drop their guard,
run away. Got that?

18:06.555 --> 18:07.920
Now, I challenge you!

18:08.557 --> 18:09.683
How stupid...

18:09.725 --> 18:12.193
Senishenta, take care of him.

18:20.369 --> 18:22.360
You're pretty tough-SHENTA...

18:40.022 --> 18:41.683
Usako, now!

18:41.824 --> 18:43.621
I couldn't do such a thing...

18:43.692 --> 18:45.592
- Hurry up!
- R-Right...

18:51.500 --> 18:53.695
I said you won't
be able to escape.

18:54.403 --> 18:55.597
Usako!

18:55.638 --> 18:57.401
Where are you looking-SHENTA?!

18:57.439 --> 18:59.703
Your opponent is ME-SHENTA!

19:05.314 --> 19:07.441
Don't you want
to get this back?

19:11.720 --> 19:13.449
T-That's...!

19:14.256 --> 19:16.019
You don't need it?

19:16.058 --> 19:19.050
If you don't need it,
I guess I'll destroy it.

19:30.940 --> 19:34.740
Now be obedient and let
your pure heart be taken!

19:34.777 --> 19:36.768
Otherwise...

19:39.415 --> 19:41.349
Stop it!

19:46.755 --> 19:47.983
Usako!!!

19:48.524 --> 19:49.422
Fool!

20:00.169 --> 20:01.158
Impossible...!

20:03.939 --> 20:04.906
U-Usako...

20:06.442 --> 20:08.342
Mamo-chan!

20:11.342 --> 20:15.342
