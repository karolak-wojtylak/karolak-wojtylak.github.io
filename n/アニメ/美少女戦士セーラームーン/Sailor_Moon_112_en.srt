1
00:00:02,382 --> 00:00:05,579
We have to find the Messiah now!?

2
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:09,316
On top of that, strange enemies are
appearing, and we're in a bind!

3
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:13,258
Hey, Chibiusa! What are you running
around at a time like this for?

4
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:15,659
What happened to your
"cherished meetings"?

5
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:17,755
Bad girls who forget their training...

6
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:20,528
...get punished in the name of the moon!

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,496
Our messiah of silence...

8
00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:52,697
How are you feeling today?

9
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,707
My head feels a little heavy...

10
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:59,837
Hurry up and give me a perfect pure heart...

11
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,471
I understand.

12
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:05,211
I need to take perfect
pure hearts from humans...

13
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,312
...and transfer them into
energy for your awakening.

14
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,169
As you can see, cormorants
dive underwater to catch fish...

15
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:30,903
...and keep the fish deep in their throats.

16
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:33,377
"Ukai" is a fishing method
using this trait of these birds...

17
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:37,143
...and we will use this method as reference
in getting pure hearts from now on.

18
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:40,675
First, we approach the target,
and release a Daimohn.

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,984
The Daimohn will swallow the pure heart...

20
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:45,388
...and come back to me.

21
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:48,951
Then, I will make it spit out the pure heart.

22
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:53,226
It is a very safe yet effective method...

23
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:54,596
Mimet!

24
00:01:56,535 --> 00:02:00,096
Are my lectures that boring?

25
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:02,467
Um...

26
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:05,606
To bring such things into your work place...

27
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:09,512
It's nice following trends and all, but it
is troubling if you forget your work...

28
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:12,483
Do you have clues as to where the
pure hearts are in the first place?

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,784
Of course, Professor!

30
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:21,054
I have already found someone
with a heart of amazing purity!

31
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:25,792
I see... Then I shall sit back and
see how you work, Mimet.

32
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:29,232
Sailor Moon isn't the true messiah, anyway.

33
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:35,438
When the time comes,
the Grail will choose its own user.

34
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:40,002
In other words, we will awaken
the messiah of silence first.

35
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:44,681
That is correct, Mimet.

36
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,690
Western!

37
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:29,387
Celebrities who show dreams to their fans
must have hearts that are purer than most...

38
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:33,762
I will use that energy to
awaken our messiah!

39
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:40,167
If the correct person
gets a hold of the grail...

40
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:44,472
...the world will be filled with divine light,
and evil of all sorts will be crushed.

41
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,507
However, if evil hands
get a hold of the grail...

42
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:53,985
...the entire world will be ruled by darkness,
and the age of shadows will begin.

43
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:57,580
If that happens, the future will
change as well, of course...

44
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,421
Then, that foretelling dream...!!

45
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:08,400
Setsuna, you came here from the
future to tell us about that, right?

46
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:09,731
Yes...

47
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:11,360
Well, I'll be going now.

48
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:13,132
Eh?! Why?

49
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:19,569
I must find the messiah along
with Sailor Uranus and Neptune.

50
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:22,073
W-Wait a minute!

51
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:28,812
Why just the three of them...?

52
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:33,124
Oh, man, she could have
told us a lot more stuff!.

53
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:34,625
Don't ask for too much!

54
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,424
I'm sure she has all sorts
of reasons of her own...

55
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:39,622
But, you know...

56
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:42,657
But... It's a shame that
Usagi isn't the messiah.

57
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:46,137
In any case, we have to think
of how to find the messiah.

58
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:48,503
But where do we look...?

59
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,476
You know, how about
zeroing in on the diners?

60
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:57,847
They say the messiah, so she just has
to be in a "meshi-ya"! (food place)

61
00:04:57,883 --> 00:04:58,872
Sheesh...

62
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:00,385
Hello!

63
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:03,721
Hey... Where's Plu?

64
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:07,157
Setsuna left, saying she
had something to do.

65
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:12,626
Darn... I was planning on
going to the park with her...

66
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:16,730
Hey, no way! I can't!
I have no time for that now!

67
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:20,135
Darn.

68
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:23,266
Chibiusa, which park were
you planning to go to?

69
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,903
Juban Natural Park...

70
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:27,879
Then, I'll take you there!

71
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:29,039
Really!?

72
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:30,070
Come on...

73
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:33,573
Minako! We're in the middle of
an important discussion, right!?

74
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:37,419
Usagi, don't say that, you sound like Ami...

75
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:40,425
Minako... what is in that park?

76
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:43,186
Minako!

77
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,058
Oh, all right! I'll confess!

78
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,195
Actually, there's a filming for
a Yosaku Eda movie there today!

79
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:54,831
Filming a Yosaku Eda movie!? Amazing!

80
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:57,273
Chibiusa! I'll go along with you!

81
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:58,333
You know...

82
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:00,706
Yosaku Eda, huh...?

83
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:03,647
He's so cool, it's a little like HI M...

84
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:06,276
See? See? Don't you
want to see the real thing?

85
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:08,411
Okay, that's it!
You're coming with us, right, Rei?

86
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:11,651
Well, I guess I can go along...

87
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,590
All right! Hey, let's go, Ami!

88
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,526
Usagi, what are we going
to do about the messiah...?

89
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:21,056
Well, well! You never know,
the messiah could be in such a place!

90
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,397
Why?

91
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:25,096
Why? Well, that's because... uh...

92
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:32,505
I-In other words, a hunch! My hunch!

93
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:34,307
All right, let's go.

94
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:35,813
Even Ami...

95
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,509
You guys aren't being serious!

96
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:40,017
We need to change our pace every so often.

97
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:43,283
I think it's better than worrying about
something and not getting anything done.

98
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:48,624
That's right! And studying in the great
wilderness might help us learn, too!

99
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,424
Oh, no, I thought we were
going there to have fun...?

100
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:52,259
Oh...?

101
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:56,063
All right! Let's all go to Juban Natural Park!

102
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:57,625
Yeah!

103
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,160
Oh, boy...

104
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:06,973
Yosaku Eda is filming the movie
"The Akafuji Gunman" on location today...

105
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,071
That must be it!

106
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:11,605
Yosaku is...

107
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,078
There, that's him!

108
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:17,213
He really is handsome... Yosaku...

109
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:19,247
Before I abduct his
pure heart and kill him...

110
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,782
...I should at least have him
eat a handmade cake!

111
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:23,317
Yosaku!

112
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,693
What are you going to do,
approaching Yosaku like that!?

113
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:31,726
Yosaku is in the middle of
very important work right now!

114
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,206
It's distracting to see you in such
an outfit loitering around here!

115
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,172
Yeah, really!

116
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,143
All I wanted to do is to have
him eat a handmade cake...

117
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:41,169
A cake? Ha!

118
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:44,649
Yosaku hates sweet stuff!.

119
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:49,284
Even ants won't touch a cake like that! Right?

120
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:52,415
Yeah! Take this as your lesson,
and don't get near Yosaku!

121
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,119
My cake...

122
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,786
What's wrong?

123
00:07:57,963 --> 00:08:00,022
Those girls were my fans, right?

124
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,798
Oh... No...

125
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,803
Lately, they've been rather abrasive...

126
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:07,032
This cake... was it actually for me...?

127
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,872
Y-Yes...

128
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:13,037
You took the time to bake it,
but it all went to waste...

129
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,037
It's delicious.

130
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:18,107
Thanks!

131
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,640
- See ya!
- Stay and watch for a while.

132
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:24,287
Yosaku... They said that
he didn't like sweets...

133
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:26,655
It's love! This must be love!!

134
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,255
Yosaku... He must have fallen
deeply in love with meat first glance!

135
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:32,228
But...

136
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:36,530
I am destined to take your
pure heart and kill you...

137
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:39,401
I'm sure it's tough for you,
but give up on this romance...

138
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:41,731
Don't come any closer!

139
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:44,901
You're going to get into another fight anyway.

140
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:46,774
If you're going to leave me alone...

141
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:48,370
...don't come after me!

142
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:52,514
I won't leave you all alone...!

143
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:53,381
Joe...

144
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:56,782
Oh... how handsome...

145
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:58,619
Yosaku...

146
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:02,150
If I steal your pure heart...

147
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:04,424
...this movie will remain incomplete...

148
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:06,522
But I won't forget.

149
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:11,764
I will engrave your last
performance deep into my eyes!

150
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,877
The hat that Moma-Ikuko bought for me!

151
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:22,040
Someone catch it!

152
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,913
It's an important hat!

153
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:31,083
Wait...!

154
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:41,295
Here...

155
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,163
Thank you!

156
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:46,797
I'm glad... it didn't fall into the river.

157
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:48,231
Are you all right?

158
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:52,136
It's just another seizure...

159
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:53,474
Don't worry.

160
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,979
But...

161
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:59,917
It'll be over... in a minute.

162
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:08,223
I'm all right now.

163
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,023
I'm glad.

164
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:11,996
I know! Do you want to play with me?

165
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:15,662
I'm Chibiusa!

166
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:20,663
I'm Hotaru.

167
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:38,512
All right! Time for a break!

168
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,024
Is could get at least an
autograph before I kill him...

169
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:47,295
Yosaku...

170
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:53,099
Is it all right? In a place like this...

171
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:55,698
We don't have time to see each other
unless it's sometime like this, right?

172
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:59,507
- That's true...
- Yosaku... He has me, and yet...

173
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:01,205
How dare he!!

174
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:03,305
In that case...

175
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:07,546
Appear, Daimohn!

176
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:15,591
Western!

177
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:41,617
Western!

178
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:43,443
Run!

179
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:46,622
Yosaku really is after that woman...!

180
00:11:46,658 --> 00:11:49,991
Western! Take Yosaku's pure heart!

181
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:52,724
Hi-yo, Silver!

182
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:57,266
Western! Western! Western! Western!

183
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:58,462
Hi-yo!

184
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:05,065
Help us!

185
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,340
What's going on!?

186
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:07,436
Bang! Bang!

187
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:13,248
I haven't paid you back for the cake yet!

188
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:16,049
Western! Make sure you take
good care of those girls!!

189
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:18,283
Bang! Bang! Bang!

190
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:19,153
- Oh, my god!
- Help!

191
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,320
What should I do...?

192
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:30,358
I can't transform in front of Hotaru...

193
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:33,367
Woohoo! Mako-chan's box lunch!

194
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:37,102
But... how far did Chibiusa go to play?

195
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:38,700
It's rather rowdy...

196
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:41,838
Is break over already?

197
00:12:42,547 --> 00:12:43,138
That's...

198
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,148
A Daimohn!

199
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:46,776
Everyone! Let's transform!

200
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:48,946
Western! That's enough!

201
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:51,478
Hurry up and take Yosaku's pure heart!

202
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,351
Okay! Western!

203
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:56,220
Hold it right there!

204
00:12:59,398 --> 00:13:02,561
Interrupting the shooting of
a fun movie for people...

205
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:05,570
...an outlaw chasing after
innocent people with a gun!

206
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:09,870
Even if Wyatt Earp forgives you,
we won't forgive you!

207
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:11,102
In the name of the moon...

208
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:12,508
...we'll punish you!

209
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:13,908
Shut up!

210
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:15,913
Western, get them!

211
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:17,881
Yeah! Western!

212
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,015
Leave it to me!

213
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:44,299
MOON SPIRAL...

214
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:47,311
...HEART...

215
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:49,836
...ATTACK!

216
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:52,374
Bang!

217
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,941
Bang! Bang!

218
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,781
The attack doesn't work!?

219
00:13:57,823 --> 00:13:59,723
It's different from previous Daimohns!

220
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,218
Western! Now's your chance!

221
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:09,961
Yumi!

222
00:14:12,337 --> 00:14:13,964
Dammit...!

223
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:24,338
You're kidding...

224
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:25,576
She ate it!

225
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:29,053
Well done, Western!
Let's go back to the professor now!

226
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,111
Yeah! Western!

227
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:32,585
WORLD SHAKING!

228
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:35,249
DEEP SUBMERGE!

229
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:42,797
What!?

230
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:44,865
Guided by a new era...

231
00:14:44,903 --> 00:14:47,167
Sailor Uranus acts with elegance!

232
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:49,799
Sailor Neptune acts with grace!

233
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:53,810
That's it!

234
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,674
Western! Grab those kids!!

235
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,188
Look out!

236
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:05,246
Chibiusa!

237
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:08,250
Western!

238
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:09,419
Chibiusa!

239
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:15,532
Don't move until we're far, far away!

240
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:19,469
If you move even just a
little bit, this girl... Well...

241
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:21,438
I won't care what happens!

242
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:23,773
Chibiusa...

243
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:29,038
DEAD SCREAM...

244
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:37,683
Plu!

245
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:41,191
Sailor Moon!
Under go your second transformation!

246
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,055
CRISIS...

247
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:49,498
MAKE UP!

248
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:58,468
Western!

249
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,427
RAINBOW...

250
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:23,991
...MOON...

251
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:27,527
HEART ACHE!

252
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:40,483
Love... LOVELY!

253
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:59,662
I'll get you for this!!

254
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,940
What was that?

255
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:06,773
It seems like our new enemy...

256
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:11,772
Usagi!

257
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:14,776
This is really tough...

258
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:19,280
Chibiusa...

259
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:20,621
Hotaru!

260
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:21,489
Ouch...

261
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:22,925
Chibiusa!

262
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:25,361
Oh, no! You're hurt!

263
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:28,195
I'm sorry... it was because
you covered for me...

264
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,861
It's just a scratch. I'm all right!

265
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,767
Let me take a look at it.

266
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:49,080
Amazing!

267
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:54,987
Everyone in my class is scared of this...
And they won't come close to me...

268
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:59,326
It really is creepy, to have powers like this.

269
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:01,792
That's not true!

270
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:05,328
It's wonderful! It really is!

271
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:07,829
Really...?

272
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:09,829
Yeah!

273
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:16,978
Thank--

274
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:20,377
Are you all right, Hotaru?

275
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:22,545
I'm all right...

276
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:25,014
Hey, Hotaru...?

277
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:26,990
Hold it together, Hotaru!

278
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:32,988
I'm glad...

279
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:36,797
But why are they still after pure hearts?

280
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:40,271
Sailor Moon!
I'll let you hold onto the Grail for a while.

281
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:43,138
Wait! Hey, let's look for
the Messiah together!!

282
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:46,236
That can't happen.

283
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:48,074
We're different from you.

284
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:50,172
We'll look for the Messiah.

285
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:52,649
What do you mean by that?

286
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:02,021
Why Pluto as well...?

287
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,994
That's right, where's Chibiusa?

288
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:05,859
She was here until a moment ago.

289
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:09,162
Sheesh, that girl really...

290
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:15,033
I'm sorry to make you worry...

291
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:16,802
It's really all right!

292
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:18,502
Oh, it's Papa.

293
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:20,033
Is that you, Hotaru?

294
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:24,810
What happened? I was worried
because you were so late.

295
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:26,783
I just had a seizure...

296
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:30,781
Papa, this is Chibiusa.
She walked me all the way home.

297
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:34,521
I see... Thank you, Chibiusa.

298
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:36,349
See ya.

299
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:37,759
Can I see you again?

300
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:40,530
Yeah! We're already friends!

301
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:43,523
Friends...

302
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:46,528
I'm happy for you, Hotaru.

303
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:49,339
Papa...

304
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:51,073
Well, I'll see you later!

305
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:52,098
See you...!

306
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:54,543
Come visit us again.
We'll be waiting for you!

307
00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:56,813
Sure!

308
00:19:56,848 --> 00:20:00,045
I want to see my papa, too...

309
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:02,452
Good night, Papa.

310
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:04,853
Good night, Hotaru.

311
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:11,853
