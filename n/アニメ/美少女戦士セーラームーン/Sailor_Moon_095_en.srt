1
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:04,407
The pure love of the
boy named Umino...

2
00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:06,351
...tastes slightly
like a lemon.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,320
Confess your feelings,
you fried shrimp.

4
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:10,346
And don't forget the julienne
cabbage on the side.

5
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:12,722
I won't forgive
you for stealing...

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,557
...such a delicious-sounding
pure heart of a boy!

7
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:17,529
I, Sailor Moon...

8
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:20,464
...will punish you in
the name of the moon!

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,664
Professor.

10
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:37,535
It's you, Kaorinite.

11
00:00:37,573 --> 00:00:38,699
Yes.

12
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:42,900
A talisman is inside
lovers' pure hearts.

13
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:46,244
Professor?
A new Daimohn egg...

14
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,345
Kaorinite.

15
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,550
How many Daimohn eggs must we
waste to retrieve the talismans...?

16
00:00:55,457 --> 00:00:59,188
What of the nuisances who call
themselves the Sailor Soldiers?

17
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:05,059
At this rate, I can't
expect any results...

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,467
...no matter how many
Daimohn eggs I throw out.

19
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:11,735
Then I will head out
personally this time.

20
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,437
All right.

21
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:27,012
Leave it to me.

22
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:42,563
Umino?

23
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,697
He's not here yet?

24
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:47,231
Usagi...

25
00:01:47,943 --> 00:01:49,877
What do you want in
a place like this?

26
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:51,311
I have a secret to
talk to you about.

27
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:52,973
A secret?

28
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:56,178
Naru has been
acting weird lately.

29
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:57,480
Weird?

30
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,885
I can't put it
into words well...

31
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:02,721
N-No, nothing's wrong.

32
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:05,388
Umino... I'm sorry, but can
you go home without me?

33
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:08,123
It seems like she's
hiding something from me.

34
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:11,599
Stop it, I'm not
hiding anything.

35
00:02:13,502 --> 00:02:16,198
I'm sure it's something
she can't tell me.

36
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:20,007
Maybe she has a
new boyfriend now!

37
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:23,870
Everyday, for Naru, I made
her favorite: fried shrimp!

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,207
Because I wanted
Naru to eat this!

39
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:31,481
This fried shrimp of
sweat, tears, and love!

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,484
Umino... Are you really
worried about all this?

41
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,127
In any case, I'll casually
bring it up with Naru later.

42
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:46,027
Usagi, I'm counting on you.

43
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:51,036
Hey, Naru.

44
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,135
What do you think
about Umino lately?

45
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:55,871
He's been acting
weird lately.

46
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:59,576
He gets really fidgety
when he's in front of me.

47
00:02:59,615 --> 00:03:02,379
How to say it...? Maybe he's
keeping a secret from me.

48
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,476
What, you too, Naru?

49
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,320
Nothing. And what
about this secret?

50
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:10,257
Maybe he's got
a new girlfriend.

51
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:14,257
Considering it's Umino of all
people, I'm sure it's okay!

52
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:15,456
Y-You think so...?

53
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:18,625
Yeah! There's no way Umino
would be so popular with girls!

54
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,467
Well, excuse me!

55
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:23,733
He does have a lot of
good things about him!

56
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:24,670
Naru?

57
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,697
I've had enough.
I'm going home!

58
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:28,642
N-Naru...

59
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:32,441
So, Naru thinks
about Umino, too.

60
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,308
Oh, I get it!
This is so simple!

61
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,251
I just have to get rid of
their misunderstandings!

62
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:40,881
At times like this,
I can rely on...

63
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:43,580
Leave it to Rei for all
your romance problems!

64
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,819
Rei, of course!

65
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:48,562
...and that's how it is now.

66
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:52,056
Oh, if they care about
each other, it's easy.

67
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:54,626
All we need to do is
have them confirm...

68
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,604
...their feelings for
each other, right?

69
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:59,505
Yeah. It's just like you, Rei,
to say something good.

70
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,203
There's a perfect event
for such a situation!

71
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:03,370
Ta-dah!

72
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:05,307
Oh? Lovers' Park?

73
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:07,144
Yup! As part ofthe
grand opening...

74
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:08,945
...they're having
an affection contest.

75
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:11,544
If we can get Umino and
Naru to participate...

76
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:13,420
That's great! A great idea!

77
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:16,390
The winners get to
light a flame of love...

78
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,222
...in a heart-
shaped monument!

79
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:21,290
That's so lovely! I'd love
to do that with Mamo-chan!

80
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,764
Idiot! What are you going
to do by entering, Usagi?

81
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:27,258
Their love will deepen as
a result of the contest!

82
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:29,065
Then, Mamo-chan
and I could--

83
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:31,868
As I was saying,
if you win the contest...

84
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:33,602
...you'll ruin
their relationship!

85
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:34,904
Oh, I get it...

86
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:38,141
Rei, you're so smart!

87
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,115
It's first come, first serve,
so better apply early.

88
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,241
Yeah!

89
00:04:45,988 --> 00:04:47,649
Hurry, hurry!

90
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,452
Where are you going, Usagi?

91
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:53,824
Don't worry about
that yet. Leave it to me!

92
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:54,886
Let's go!

93
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,295
Here!

94
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,435
T-That can't be...

95
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,131
- Usagi!
- Usagi...!

96
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:04,399
What's wrong?

97
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,705
I wanted you two to make up
by entering this contest...

98
00:05:11,713 --> 00:05:13,840
- Usagi, actually...
- Usagi, actually...

99
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,847
See?

100
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:18,316
Umino!

101
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:19,945
Naru...

102
00:05:20,956 --> 00:05:25,256
A-Actually, I wanted to
enter the contest with Naru....

103
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:28,457
Then you should
have said so earlier.

104
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:31,898
I thought so as well, but I
didn't quite get a chance to...

105
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,527
That's why you
were so fidgety.

106
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,400
Sheesh! You can
be such an idiot!

107
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:37,837
You say that...

108
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:40,501
...but you were feeling
the same way, Naru!

109
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,908
I-I wasn't as bad as Umino...

110
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:51,618
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

111
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:53,018
All right!

112
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,682
Ouch!

113
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:57,924
Now I'm perfectly ready
for tomorrow's contest!

114
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,325
I have to go to sleep early
tonight to prepare for it!

115
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:02,627
One sheep. Baa...

116
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:06,060
Two sheep.
Baa... Baa...

117
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:08,069
I can't be nervous.
I have to go to sleep.

118
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:09,400
Four sheep.

119
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:11,736
Oh, wait, the third
sheep got lost.

120
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:35,589
30,003 sheep.
Baa... Baa...

121
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,995
Baa! Baa!

122
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:39,694
I have to sleep!
I have to sleep soon!

123
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:42,101
Baa! Baa! BAA!

124
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:48,602
I feel an evil presence
in this park.

125
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:53,503
I'm sure there will be
a Daimohn around here.

126
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:58,149
I won't let them
have the talisman.

127
00:06:58,653 --> 00:06:59,881
Now both of you, do your best.

128
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,252
Y-Yeah. We'll do our best.

129
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:02,813
Umino, are you all right?

130
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:05,019
- YES!
- He doesn't look all right...

131
00:07:06,395 --> 00:07:08,727
Huh? Everyone!

132
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:10,459
Oh, there she is.

133
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,262
What are you
guys doing here?

134
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:14,233
To cheer those two on!

135
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:16,169
I'm wherever there is romance!

136
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:17,899
It seems a little fun, too.

137
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,204
I was thinking I could
make use of it someday...

138
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:22,369
For what?

139
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,278
D-Don't take me seriously.
It was just a play on words.

140
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:28,780
Huh? It's Haruka and Michiru.

141
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:29,749
Wonderful!

142
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:31,582
I wonder if they're in
the contest as well.

143
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,985
Two girls together?

144
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:35,683
But looking at them like this,
it's like they really were lovers...

145
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:41,622
Everyone, the affection
contest is about to begin!

146
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:43,324
Please gather at the stage!

147
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:45,196
Well, let's go cheer them on!

148
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:49,704
Everyone, are you
living full of love?

149
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:52,599
The couples here are
the selected people...

150
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,472
...who are overflowing in love!

151
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,704
And today, we'll
have these couples...

152
00:07:56,745 --> 00:07:59,578
...compare how deep their
feelings of love are!

153
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:02,549
The winning couple will be
the couple with a pure heart...

154
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:05,075
...that love each
other the most!

155
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,145
Go for it, Naru!

156
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,487
Hold yourself together, Umino!

157
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,151
You look wonderful, Michiru!

158
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:13,320
Look over here, Haruka!

159
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:14,089
Come on...

160
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:16,597
Who did you come
here to cheer on?

161
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:19,259
That's what you call a
sudden change of heart.

162
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,962
- Oh, is that so?
- I'm sorry!

163
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,402
The first game is
just a small test.

164
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:27,033
Let's have them guess their lover's
hand that appears through the hole!

165
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:29,066
Begin, from those
that figured it out!

166
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:33,481
T-This sure was a fast one!

167
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:37,945
It's Haruka...

168
00:08:37,986 --> 00:08:41,114
I wonder if they really are
in THAT kind of a relationship.

169
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:45,581
Now, scream out
your lover's name!

170
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:46,889
What!?

171
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:52,030
Can you tell us
your lover's name?

172
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,797
You sure want me to do
something really cheap.

173
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:58,932
I'm begging you. It's just
what the script says.

174
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:00,339
Michiru.

175
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,412
Success! A correct guess!

176
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:06,812
Now, let's keep
going at this pace!

177
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:09,214
- They did it!
- Next up is Umino!

178
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:11,048
Which one is
Naru's hand?

179
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:14,712
Here, Umino,
take a handkerchief.

180
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:16,417
Make sure to wipe
yourself dry.

181
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:19,823
T-That's it!
Naru's hand is...

182
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:20,885
...this one!

183
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,892
Now, call out your
girlfriend's name!

184
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:26,526
Naru, my angel...

185
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:27,592
You're wrong!

186
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:29,968
Sorry, you made a mistake.

187
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:31,336
Oh, well...

188
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:32,465
T-That can't be!

189
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:34,338
I'm sure Naru had
a Band-Aid on her finger...

190
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,003
What are you doing!?
That hurts!

191
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,006
Sheesh. There's no way I
would still have a wound...

192
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:41,311
...from six months ago
on my finger, Umino!

193
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,280
But he still remembered
something from that far back...

194
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,480
Are you all right?

195
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:47,545
Yes.

196
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,086
Nothing compared to the pain
Naru's heart is feeling!

197
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,089
Naru, please forgive me!!

198
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,689
Let's go to our
next contestant...

199
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:58,961
They sure try hard.
It's only a game.

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,467
It is, but...

201
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,030
I think being able to become
that serious is a wonderful thing.

202
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,838
It's not just
a game for him...

203
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:38,701
The three-legged race
of love! START!

204
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:44,742
The karaoke of love!

205
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:49,340
"A sea turtle's egg..."

206
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:51,284
Wrong song, Umino...

207
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:53,350
Pitiful.

208
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:56,016
But he has the best
heart of them all.

209
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:59,159
He's taking this
so seriously.

210
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,890
I'll admit to that.

211
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:05,459
It would be nice
if they could win...

212
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:09,704
Now, it's finally
the last game!

213
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:13,434
Even the ones who've been losing
have a shot at turning it around!

214
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:17,104
It's the Confess
Your Love Game!

215
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:21,442
You in the audience are
going to award them points!

216
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:23,474
We'll determine how many points
by the volume of the applause!

217
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:24,815
Are you ready!?

218
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:26,047
YEAH!

219
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,385
Starting with these two!

220
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:31,415
Now, a confession
from him to her!

221
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,586
Show is over.

222
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:36,893
I said the show is over.
We'll drop out of this one.

223
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:38,558
But...

224
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,058
We weren't taking this
seriously to begin with...

225
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:45,004
...and it looks like
we'd win at this rate.

226
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:48,037
True love is
what needs to win.

227
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,902
Love...

228
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:53,439
Love is everything!

229
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:58,381
So, with that...

230
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:00,485
Farewell!

231
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:03,286
Encore! Encore!

232
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:05,918
N-Now, the next
couple, please.

233
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:08,092
Hanako... Come with me.

234
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,653
Takao...

235
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:11,524
I'm so happy!

236
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,932
Hanako... You have bad
eyesight, don't you?

237
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:19,902
Love is, love is...

238
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,441
...a BATTLE!!

239
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:25,812
L-Love is to endure...

240
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,541
Red wins!

241
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:31,450
Now, it's finally time
for the last couple!

242
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:32,919
Come on!

243
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:36,484
- We've been waiting for this!
- Umino, do it well!

244
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:38,852
N-Naru!

245
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:43,525
Umino!

246
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,896
Is he all right...?

247
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:47,026
Umino...

248
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,036
Naru...

249
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:56,042
Naru, you're always
bright, just like the sun.

250
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:57,872
Umino...

251
00:12:57,912 --> 00:13:00,881
I'm always being
such a klutz...

252
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:04,078
...and I might not be worthy
of someone like you, Naru.

253
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:08,979
Why do you continue to
see someone like me...?

254
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:12,652
Maybe it's just
a whim of God.

255
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:16,121
When I think that...

256
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:17,256
B-But!

257
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:21,029
I'm happy just by seeing
your smile, Naru.

258
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:24,161
For Naru's
angelic smile...

259
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:27,174
...and to protect
your beautiful smile...

260
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:31,269
I... I, Gurio Umino...

261
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:34,443
...can die!

262
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,910
U-Umino...

263
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:39,610
Umino...

264
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,050
Now, what do you
think of this couple?

265
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,162
Great!

266
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:53,123
You're the best in Japan!

267
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,196
Such an ovation!

268
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:59,002
By unanimous vote,
this couple is the winner!

269
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:04,973
Now, both of you,
light the flame of love!

270
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,205
Umino, we did it!

271
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:08,738
Y-Yes.

272
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:16,818
This is the proof of
Naru's and my love...

273
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,783
Naru's and my...

274
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:23,820
What?

275
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:28,091
What is it!?

276
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,973
DIE HEART!

277
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,350
Umino! Run!

278
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,978
The monument of the love
between us, Naru...!

279
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,783
Just hurry!

280
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:49,949
Inside the pure heart
which thinks of...

281
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,891
...one's lover,
we find a talisman.

282
00:14:54,462 --> 00:14:55,929
Dammit!

283
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,463
Look out, Naru!

284
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,294
Umino!

285
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:08,267
- Umino!
- Umino!

286
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:15,682
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

287
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:51,450
MERCURY STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

288
00:15:55,323 --> 00:16:00,488
MARS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

289
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:07,835
JUPITER STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

290
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:17,470
VENUS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

291
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:27,982
I've found it.

292
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:31,358
Hold it right there!

293
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:32,689
Who is it, HEART?

294
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:36,163
To ruin the light of love that
they finally got a hold of...!

295
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:37,664
Umino!

296
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:39,530
Even if the cupid of
love forgave you...

297
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,296
...I won't forgive you!

298
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:45,467
For love and justice, the pretty
soldier in a sailor suit!

299
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,269
Sailor Moon!

300
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:49,003
Likewise, Sailor Mars!

301
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:50,635
Sailor Mercury!

302
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:51,804
Sailor Venus!

303
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,074
Sailor Jupiter!

304
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:58,340
In the name of the moon,
I punish you!

305
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:01,844
You're...!

306
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:05,552
Little ladies...
Girls should behave like girls.

307
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:11,023
LET'S DANCING!

308
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,630
LET'S DANCING!

309
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:18,263
LET'S DANCING!

310
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:20,501
W-Well, just for a little bit.

311
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,270
Your hand...

312
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,743
Sure...

313
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,894
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Uranus...

314
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:51,962
...acts with elegance!

315
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:56,068
Likewise, Sailor Neptune...

316
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,101
...acts with grace!

317
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:03,039
Die Heart, provide dance partners
for these girls as well.

318
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:04,051
DIE HEART!

319
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:06,645
I'll find my
own dance partner!

320
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,748
WORLD SHAKING!

321
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:19,299
DIE HEART!

322
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:22,531
It's no time to be
fooled by illusions.

323
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,764
R-Right!

324
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:28,074
No matter how
many you defeat...

325
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:31,135
...we can make more
and more Daimohn eggs.

326
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:33,209
Then we will defeat you!

327
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,442
We'll settle the score now.

328
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:37,951
Is that so?

329
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:42,288
You need 10 more years of
training to fight me!

330
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,647
See you.

331
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:45,357
Dammit!

332
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:48,191
Umino! Umino,
please, answer me!

333
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:50,060
Quick, the crystal!

334
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:51,224
DIE HEART!

335
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:53,825
It's not it...
It's not a talisman.

336
00:18:53,868 --> 00:18:54,994
Who are you?

337
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:57,061
Take good care of him.

338
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,640
Umino! I'm so glad!

339
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,840
Naru?

340
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,780
DIE HEART!

341
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:11,478
That trick won't
work this time!

342
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:39,104
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

343
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:53,423
LOVELY!

344
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:05,267
Now, turn the switches on!

345
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:07,866
Applause for
the happy couple!

346
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:11,502
I'm so happy for them.

347
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:13,446
Yeah, it's thanks
to you, Rei!

348
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:15,005
Umino looks happy.

349
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,914
He really did do his best.

350
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:18,816
I'm jealous.
I wish I could...

351
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:21,915
Even you, Umino the klutz,
did your best.

352
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:22,888
Y-Yeah...

353
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:24,448
By the way, what's
for lunch tomorrow?

354
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:27,427
I'm so happy, I'll be
making fried lobsters!

355
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:29,122
But is that yummy?

356
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:29,959
I don't know...

357
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:31,965
Sheesh, Umino!

358
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:38,965
