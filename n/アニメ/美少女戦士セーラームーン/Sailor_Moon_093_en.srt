1
00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:05,542
Michiru, who I look up to,
invites me to a concert.

2
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:11,554
But another problem appears there!

3
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:15,693
To you, who gets in the way
of a nice romantic night...

4
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:20,530
...I, Sailor Moon, will punish
you in the name of the moon!

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,278
Mamo-chan!

6
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:35,513
It's Usako!

7
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:37,787
I brought some delicious cookies!

8
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:44,057
And... I-I-If there is love,
I'm sure 1 or 2...

9
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:47,364
...or 3 or 4... burnt ones
won't get in the way!

10
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:56,706
Mamo-chan?

11
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:05,720
Such a mature atmosphere as always...

12
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:10,223
F-Future Considerations
of Genetic Engineering...?

13
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:15,622
Mamo-chan is in college!

14
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:17,928
He's at a really high level!

15
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:35,044
I guess it doesn't fit Mamo-chan...

16
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:37,552
These charred cookies...

17
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,555
Usako.

18
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:49,028
I really am good for nothing.

19
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:52,864
What are you saying all of a sudden?

20
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:57,634
I fail as Mamo-chan's wife after all!

21
00:01:57,673 --> 00:02:00,267
D-Don't cry...

22
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:07,578
It's not bad to have
something on the bitter side...

23
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:09,575
Mamo-chan...

24
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:13,082
Usako, you're fine the way you are now.

25
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:15,556
Mamo-chan!

26
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:28,665
And so Mamoru ate all
of the charred cookies?

27
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:31,036
Poor thing.

28
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:32,904
I hope he didn't get
an upset stomach from it.

29
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:34,436
What do you mean by that!?

30
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:36,637
She's right, that's saying too much.

31
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,912
Ami!

32
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:41,782
If it was thoroughly cooked,
there is little...

33
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:44,149
...chance that he'd get
food poisoning from it.

34
00:02:48,657 --> 00:02:49,453
Usagi.

35
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:50,651
She's gonna get mad!

36
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:01,926
Today's Usa-chan is a good Usa-chan!

37
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:04,304
Say, Ami?

38
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:07,035
I want you to teach me something!

39
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:08,303
W-What is it?

40
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:12,309
Generic... No, genetic engineering!

41
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:15,449
And Mako-chan!

42
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:17,418
Can you teach me how to cook?

43
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:19,444
T-Teach you cooking, Usagi!?

44
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:21,786
Genetic engineering?

45
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:24,291
I decided that I want to
be even a little bit...

46
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:27,318
...closer to where my lovely
Mamo-chan is right now!

47
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,831
Minako, you're great
with English, right?

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,828
Why?

49
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:37,199
Rei... would be how to wear a kimono.

50
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,299
Yeah! That perfects my
preparations to be a wife!

51
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:42,003
Preparing to become a wife?

52
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:45,741
Oh, no! Crap! I forgot
I had something to do!

53
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:48,079
M-Me too! I have to get back!

54
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:51,083
Mako-chan? Minako?

55
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,581
I'll see you tomorrow!

56
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:59,821
Um, Usagi, I think you'd
be better off studying...

57
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:03,093
...biology and chemistry for our
school before genetic engineering...

58
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:04,890
It's all right, Ami.

59
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:07,401
She's just being whimsical as usual!

60
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:08,596
What do you mean by that, Rei?

61
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:13,103
When I was teaching you how
to wear a priestess's kimono...

62
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,769
...I told you many, MANY times
but you never got it!

63
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:19,536
To be your teacher is something
I never everwant to do at all, Usagi!

64
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,842
Rei, you meanie!

65
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,947
Can you say all that, Usagi?

66
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:31,491
When you learn
cooking from Mako-chan...

67
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:33,825
...or get tutored by Ami...

68
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:36,262
...you always quit within three days!

69
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:38,732
Everyone is sick of it already!

70
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:43,094
Really, at this rate
Mamoru will probably...

71
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:46,107
...say that he doesn't want
to marry you anymore!

72
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:48,974
Hey, Usagi, are you listening!

73
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:53,507
That's why I wanted to do my best...

74
00:04:54,516 --> 00:04:57,485
But, Luna... even Luna...

75
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:00,353
Usagi...

76
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:03,489
Oh... I guess she really
was serious about this...

77
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:11,729
Luna, you idiot!

78
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:34,353
At least there's no doubt that strong
powers are concentrated in this city.

79
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:39,958
And when that power grows especially
strong... those mysterious evil things...

80
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:42,054
...attack humans!

81
00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:43,962
Nothing will come from worrying.

82
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:48,800
What we are given is a very vague memory
of our past life that came back to us.

83
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:54,068
Our mission is to find
the three talismans...

84
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:57,272
...call for the holy grail which is the
source of an extreme amount of power...

85
00:05:57,312 --> 00:06:01,078
...and return it to the rightful
owner as soon as possible.

86
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:06,418
Who are the three owners of the pure
hearts that hide the talismans?

87
00:06:06,455 --> 00:06:08,184
If only we knew who they were...

88
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:13,820
But to extract those talismans means
the death of the respective owners.

89
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:15,759
We can't help that.

90
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:18,561
To meet the ultimate objective
of saving the world...

91
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,398
...a few sacrifices
have to be made.

92
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:26,840
If that's the mission given to us,
we can only plunge onward!

93
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,811
Haruka...

94
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,316
This is it!

95
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:47,252
This is the ideal princess figure!

96
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,785
That bun-headed girl from before...

97
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,991
Do you want something from us?

98
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,499
U-Um, I was just awed that you
could play a violin like that...

99
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:58,472
Like a princess...
no, um, it's very mature...

100
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:01,101
I look up to people like that!

101
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:23,388
Well, I'll be going.

102
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:25,297
Uh... Um...

103
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,164
I'm just a little frustrated...

104
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:29,397
I'll go on a little spin
and cool my head off.

105
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:31,099
Bye, bun-head!

106
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,808
Somehow I don't feel
angry at all... but...

107
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:37,107
They're not buns!

108
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:51,786
She knows this isn't a problem that
aimlessly running around will solve...

109
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,300
Miss Tsukino... was it?

110
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:02,235
Call me Usagi.

111
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,738
All right... Usagi?

112
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:06,638
Yes!

113
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:13,905
Michiru, are you going to
become a violinist in the future?

114
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:15,183
I don't know...

115
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:20,086
I'm... not sure why I was born...

116
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:23,421
I can't get a hold of which road I
should take... and I'm lost, so to say.

117
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,888
That's like me! I'm lost too!

118
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:29,419
Um, you're Michiru Kaioh, right?

119
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:31,164
The one who painted this picture?

120
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:45,240
I'm a big fan of your art!

121
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,113
I'm looking forward to
the upcoming exhibition, too!

122
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,946
Thank you.

123
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:51,619
She paints, too?

124
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:55,487
She's not like me at all! She's lost
because she has too much talent!

125
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:58,652
But, but... Me too!

126
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:07,460
I feel better now.

127
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:13,998
I thought about finding their HQ as well
but, of course, it's not really that easy.

128
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,814
H-Hey!

129
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:27,319
I see, that's why you
wanted to play the violin.

130
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:32,326
But it's no good. Even if I wanted
Mamo-chan to hear it, I can't get better.

131
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,521
Don't give up, Usagi.

132
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:37,088
You look wonderful when you're trying.

133
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:40,568
Girls always get better that way.

134
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:43,069
Michiru...

135
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:44,533
I'll give this to you.

136
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:46,871
There is a wonderful
violin recital coming up.

137
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:48,569
It's this evening.

138
00:09:48,777 --> 00:09:51,337
Please come with
the person you cherish.

139
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:53,847
S-Sure!

140
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,587
The time has come.

141
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:05,618
Kaorinite. How are
your preparations coming?

142
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,594
I have a good idea already.

143
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:10,097
Now, go, egg of Daimohn.

144
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,596
Go steal a pure heart.

145
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,635
A tuxedo without a mask
is also wonderful!

146
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,228
I'm so happy!

147
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:53,833
But a violin concert...
Aren't you trying a little too hard?

148
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:58,005
Excuse me! I may look like this,
but I am a future princess!

149
00:10:58,046 --> 00:10:58,842
Usagi!

150
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,904
Usagi!

151
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:01,915
Everyone...

152
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:05,150
You're all going to say
this isn't like me, right?

153
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:06,448
I'm sorry about earlier!

154
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:08,979
You really were serious
about learning how to cook.

155
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:12,152
I heard from Luna that
you guys were here, Usagi.

156
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:14,156
I'm sorry, Usagi.

157
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,288
Well, leave everything to me!

158
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:20,233
If you fall asleep during the performance,
I'll pinch your butt and wake you up!

159
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:23,669
Are you fine with your music lessons?

160
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:25,668
Oh, Ami!

161
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:13,551
Oh, there he is.

162
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:15,783
He's a pretty attractive guy.

163
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:18,518
It's so nice to be young.

164
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,289
You sound like an old woman!

165
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:22,319
Oh, really?

166
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:52,489
Usagi! Look in front of you!
In front of you!

167
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:55,325
Where were YOU looking, Rei?

168
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:57,854
I was watching!
I was looking in front of me!

169
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:14,410
Usako!

170
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:15,507
Mamo-chan!

171
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:27,725
OCTAVE!

172
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,176
OCTAVE!

173
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:55,151
Hurry! Go outside!

174
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,722
Usagi!

175
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:00,659
What's wrong?

176
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:02,654
OCTAVE!

177
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:03,728
It's coming!

178
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,164
Everyone, transform!

179
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,994
MERCURY STAR POWER...

180
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:10,561
MARS STAR POWER...

181
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:13,005
JUPITER STAR POWER...

182
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,168
VENUS STAR POWER...

183
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:20,678
MOON COSMIC POWER...

184
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:25,449
...MAKE UP!

185
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:20,571
OCTAVE!

186
00:15:22,977 --> 00:15:24,342
Hold it right there!

187
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:31,209
You wrecked my important,
very important romantic night!

188
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:34,244
Maidens, love with all of your life!

189
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:36,655
The sailor team of
pretty soldiers will...

190
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:40,724
...in the name of the moon...

191
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:42,320
...punish you!

192
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:48,197
OCTAVE!

193
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,198
I-I can't move!

194
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:18,626
OWW!

195
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,129
Tuxedo Mask!

196
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:27,333
A serenade fits a
beautiful moonlit night.

197
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,139
Noise that is painful to listen
to shall all disappear immediately!

198
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:34,278
OCTAVE!

199
00:16:34,716 --> 00:16:36,013
SPARKLING...

200
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,484
...WIDE PRESSURE!

201
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:48,156
Be careful! There are a lot
of people in the concert hall!

202
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:53,093
That's such a cowardly move!

203
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:55,796
Really! It's got a twisted personality!

204
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:59,129
OCTAVE!

205
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:03,871
DEEP SUBMERGE!

206
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:07,077
You guys...!

207
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:15,784
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Uranus acts with elegance!

208
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:18,587
Same here. I am Sailor Neptune!

209
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,552
Uranus! Neptune!

210
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:21,755
What in the world do you--

211
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,522
Whoa. I ask you not to
do any unnecessary probing.

212
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:29,161
Our objective is to find the talismans.

213
00:17:29,203 --> 00:17:31,763
Other than that, we have
nothing to do with each other.

214
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:35,134
Nothing to do with each other!?

215
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:39,010
I thought you were our allies, but it
seems like you guys are pretty hardheaded!

216
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:45,115
Look out!

217
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:47,713
OCTAVE!

218
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,580
Thank you.

219
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:53,116
Oh, you're welcome...

220
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:55,124
Dammit! How dare you!?

221
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:00,260
WORLD...

222
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:02,633
...SHAKING!

223
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,941
Now, Sailor Moon!

224
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:12,309
Oh, o-okay!

225
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:34,962
MOON SPIRAL...

226
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,167
...HEART...

227
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,698
...ATTACK!

228
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:53,017
Lovely!

229
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:13,764
She took the best part.

230
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,537
Uranus?

231
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:17,840
No, it's not a talisman.

232
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:19,437
It looks like another wasted trip.

233
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,380
Uranus! Neptune!

234
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:23,641
Who in the world are you?

235
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:25,379
And what are the talismans?

236
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,848
If you really want to know,
figure it out on your own.

237
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:35,090
The heart of an artist that performs
a graceful tune is very delicate.

238
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:38,121
Take care in returning it.

239
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:39,893
Oh, wait!

240
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:42,664
They don't have any manners!

241
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:46,400
But... they seem like good people...

242
00:19:53,514 --> 00:19:57,041
It's a shame... we missed out on
listening to a wonderful performance.

243
00:19:57,084 --> 00:20:00,144
How about I treat you
to a meal in its place?

244
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:02,682
Lucky me!

245
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:03,883
Usagi.

246
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:05,688
What about those lessons
to become a wife?

247
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:08,820
I-I'll start that again tomorrow!
Okay?

248
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:15,732
Of course you're going to treat
us as well, right Mamoru?

249
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:20,268
- HEY! Stop clinging onto him!
- Chinese food! Definitely Chinese!

250
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:26,247
- No, let's go French and have some wine!
- What are you saying? We're under age!

251
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:29,141
How cute.

252
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:31,777
I guess so...

253
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:38,777
