1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,994
I see, so this is Chibiusa's
new friend Hotaru Tomoe...

2
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:08,938
Hey, she's pretty cute!

3
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:12,602
Elegant, and somewhat fragile...
Totally different from you!

4
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:14,805
Make sure you aren't rude to her!

5
00:00:14,846 --> 00:00:17,144
If you do cause her any trouble...

6
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:20,082
In the name of the moon, I'll punish you!

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,484
Oh, Chibiusa, you seem to
be in a rather good mood.

8
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:33,012
I have a new friend!

9
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:34,615
Oh?

10
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,718
Come on, tell me,
what kinda person? A boy?

11
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:39,787
How far into the relationship
are you? Tell me!

12
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,528
I won't tell klutz Usagi anything!

13
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:50,400
How dare you!

14
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:56,877
What are you doing, Usagi, you idiot!

15
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,641
We have been waiting for you, Mamoru...
No, Sir Endymion.

16
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:35,914
The warriors of the Silver Millenium,
from the distant past...

17
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:38,919
And... ones summoned from the future.

18
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:41,852
URANUS PLANET POWER...

19
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,293
MAKE UP!

20
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,510
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

21
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:02,979
MAKE UP!

22
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,964
PLUTO PLANET POWER...

23
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:24,399
MAKE UP!

24
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:47,217
Sailor Uranus, guarded by Uranus,
the star of the wind.

25
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:50,690
Sailor Neptune, guarded by Neptune,
the star of the ocean.

26
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:54,425
Sailor Pluto, guarded by Pluto,
the star of the afterlife.

27
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,491
We are the three warriors
of the outer solar system!

28
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,994
The outer solar system...

29
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:07,578
Unlike the previous Sailor Soldiers,
we were given even stronger powers.

30
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:12,277
From the distant past, our duty has
been to protect the Silver Millennium...

31
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:16,514
...from enemies who intrude
from outside the solar system.

32
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:23,255
But, when we awakened in this age...

33
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:27,287
...the enemy had already quietly
nested deep down on this Earth.

34
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:32,200
We had overlooked it. The intrusion of
the enemy this time is our mistake.

35
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,204
Those are the Death Busters...
Our new enemy...!

36
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:42,207
But why don't you try to join your
forces with Sailor Moon's group?

37
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:45,375
They only get in our way...

38
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,212
What?

39
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:49,719
This battle... is too much for Sailor Moon...

40
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,619
...and for Mars, Venus, and the others.

41
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:55,615
Defeating the Death Busters,
the largest and strongest enemies...

42
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,218
...is the job of us three.

43
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,432
Eh? Chibiusa went to
all of your places, too?

44
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:08,734
Yeah. She was saying how she was invited to
a new friend's house for the very first time...

45
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:14,375
A formal dress? No, no.
As long as you look tidy, you're totally okay!

46
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:16,744
Don't you want to play to your heart's content?

47
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,843
She came to me, too, saying she
wanted to give something as a gift...

48
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,183
Hmm... I don't think you
need to bring anything...

49
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,416
But how about a book?

50
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:28,550
Your friend will know what kind of books
you like to read as well, Chibiusa.

51
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:32,061
She sure has that friend on her mind,
don't you think? Right?

52
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:35,623
Although they go to different schools,
I heard that her friend is a very quiet person.

53
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,566
So she's visiting a friend
for the first time, huh?

54
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:40,568
I just baked some cookies,
so I'll wrap you some.

55
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:42,869
You can take them to your friend's place.

56
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:48,936
If I'd known, I'd have baked cookies with a
more extravagant way to express her feelings.

57
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,947
H-Huh?

58
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,608
Extravagant cookies...?

59
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:52,980
I'm a little scared...

60
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:54,484
She doesn't know any bounds lately...

61
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:55,576
Who--

62
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,084
Chibiusa came to my place, too...

63
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,316
Rei...?

64
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:05,628
Let's see... greetings when
you're invited somewhere...

65
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,929
I, Usagi, will lecture you on
things like that right on the spot!

66
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,161
Usagi!

67
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:15,798
What are you saying, Usagi!
You have a study group to attend!

68
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,068
Oh! Michael!

69
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,441
Where? Where, where?
My Michael!

70
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,214
Oh, Michael...

71
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:27,450
Usagi...

72
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:28,213
Sheesh...

73
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:33,955
I'm telling you, you should bring
a more serious book if it's a gift...

74
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:37,222
No. I was finally able to buy
one that's always sold out.

75
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:40,625
I wanted the new Ukon Katakuri book...

76
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:42,524
No!

77
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,864
By the way, Usagi, are you
serious about tagging along?

78
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,831
Well, I am curious.

79
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:50,306
What kind of person
your friend is, and such...

80
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:51,535
My friend is cute...

81
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,873
...although a little frail, it seems.

82
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:06,818
I feel a little sorry for your friend,
but that's just the perfect situation!

83
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:09,257
Then, I really should introduce
myself as your guardian.

84
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:10,817
What part of you is my guardian?

85
00:06:10,861 --> 00:06:13,022
- Now, now... let's go, let's go.
- Don't push me!

86
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:23,039
Our illustrious Messiah of silence,
the time of your awakening is approaching!

87
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:27,704
For that, I need powerful awakening energy.

88
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:35,545
Leave it to me. I will change perfect, pure
hearts of humans into awakening energy.

89
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:39,049
I hope they suit your tastes...

90
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,059
Amazing!

91
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,057
It's a huge house!

92
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,459
Usagi, push it.

93
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:51,866
Oh? Yeah, sure.

94
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:56,129
Oh, hello...

95
00:06:58,175 --> 00:06:59,107
Excuse--

96
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:02,075
Ka--

97
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,910
K-Kaorinite...

98
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:11,251
What are you doing, Usagi!?

99
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:13,950
- Chibiusa.
- Those cookies were for...

100
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:16,221
May I ask who you are?

101
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,728
Is something wrong?
Is it a guest?

102
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:19,593
Professor...

103
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,531
Oh, you're one of Hotaru's friends.

104
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:23,794
Oh, she's Hotaru's...

105
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,165
Hello!

106
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:28,399
Hello and welcome.
I'm Hotaru's father.

107
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:30,569
H-Hello...

108
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:34,066
Oh, this is my assistant, Kaori.

109
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:37,137
Kaori, Hotaru is a little busy right now.

110
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:39,775
Lead these ladies to the living room...

111
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:40,909
Yes.

112
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:43,283
Should I brew some tasty coffee...?

113
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,983
Please, this way.

114
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:47,786
Okay!

115
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:52,494
She looks exactly like her,
but seems to be a different person...

116
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,796
Well, if you think about it,
Kaorinite wouldn't be in a place like this...

117
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:23,884
"What are you here for, Drop?"

118
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:26,796
"It's your fault that Andre died."

119
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:29,293
"No, Auntie, it is not!"

120
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:30,693
"Yes, it was--"

121
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:32,361
"Hush! Get out of my room!"

122
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:34,303
"Drop!"

123
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:37,796
How, how, how sad this main character is!

124
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:43,809
Yes, this is Mimet.

125
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:45,773
You finally answered.

126
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,308
Mimet, have you found a new target?

127
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:56,559
Of course, I've checked
out a talented pure heart.

128
00:08:57,728 --> 00:08:58,820
This will do.

129
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:01,764
The target will be holding
an autograph session...

130
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,563
Er, no, appearing at the
Juban Bookstore today.

131
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:08,737
I see... Then I will hurry up
and make a Daimohn...

132
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:11,570
...in order for it to make
it to the autograph session.

133
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:17,444
Delicious coffee is ready!

134
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:24,513
Uhenshu!

135
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:57,611
Here you go.

136
00:09:57,655 --> 00:09:59,452
Thank you very much!

137
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,617
Please continue to support me.

138
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:05,018
Yes! I'll cherish this book
for the rest of my life!

139
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,727
The coffee... isn't here yet...

140
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:17,070
Usagi!

141
00:10:17,474 --> 00:10:19,635
Hotaru... is late...

142
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:34,382
Chibiusa!

143
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:36,292
Hotaru!

144
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:38,090
A g-girl?

145
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:40,392
Who said it was a boy?

146
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,792
Your older sister...?

147
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,165
My cousin, Usagi.

148
00:10:45,202 --> 00:10:48,433
She tagged along, thinking I was
going on a date with a cute little boy!

149
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:50,872
Wha-! C-Chibiusa, I just...

150
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:52,034
It's true, isn't it?

151
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:54,670
I-I was just wanting to say
hello as your guardian...

152
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:55,906
What are you saying?

153
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,905
I can see through to what
you really were thinking!

154
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:01,344
No, you're wrong!

155
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:04,650
In the first place, it's all because
you're chasing after boys all the time!

156
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:08,283
Tee hee! Unlike you, klutzy Usagi,
I'm popular with guys!

157
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,690
What?!

158
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:12,958
See, she's laughing at me!

159
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:14,055
So it's my fault?

160
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:16,026
I-I'm sorry...

161
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,897
Welcome here.

162
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:19,300
I'm Hotaru Tomoe.

163
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,865
Oh, uh, hello...

164
00:11:21,905 --> 00:11:23,600
I hope you don't mind us here...

165
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,304
I'm sorry to keep you waiting...
Please, come up to my room.

166
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:31,305
Then, we'll take the coffee up to your room...

167
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:33,976
That's all right!

168
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:37,852
Don't butt into house affairs, Kaori!

169
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:43,751
I'm sorry...

170
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:45,523
My father is a scientist.

171
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:49,396
Because he's busy with his research,
she comes by to help out, but...

172
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:51,833
Hotaru, where's your mother?

173
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:55,330
She died... a long time ago...

174
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:59,835
Oh, I-I'm sorry... ur...

175
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:01,845
No, it's all right.

176
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,114
But I want to hear more
about you guys, Chibiusa!

177
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,852
Amazing! It's so beautiful!

178
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:19,863
Amazing, just amazing! It feels mysterious...

179
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:21,861
Thanks.

180
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:25,859
Hotaru!

181
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,137
Hotaru, what's wrong? Are you all right?

182
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:29,036
Hotaru!

183
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:32,567
I-I'm fine...

184
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:35,203
I was just a little dizzy.

185
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:37,042
I'm really all right.

186
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:48,318
What is... this?

187
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,293
T-This is...?

188
00:12:54,598 --> 00:12:56,589
It's a strange brooch...

189
00:12:56,633 --> 00:13:00,034
As long as I touch it, I feel better and better...

190
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,039
Power fows in...

191
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:07,772
Hotaru!?

192
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:12,143
Did I just say something?

193
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,949
I'm sorry. I am rather strange...

194
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:15,974
T-That's not...

195
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,886
I know! Chibiusa, your gift, your gift!

196
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,050
That's right, yeah, yeah.
This is really interesting!

197
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:25,554
What's this?

198
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:27,728
What, what?

199
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,562
Ukon Katakuri... autograph... session!?

200
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,430
It's already started!

201
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,768
Why didn't you realize this earlier!?

202
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:37,671
You were there in the
bookstore with me, Usagi!

203
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,504
It's your fault!

204
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,100
Why mine!?

205
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,112
Oh, thank you very much for your hard word!

206
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,410
Thank you so much!

207
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,074
Thank you!

208
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:49,577
Mr. Ukon!

209
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:51,611
You are...?

210
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:55,354
Thank you for the autograph earlier!

211
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:56,882
Oh, yeah...

212
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,893
And, I have one more thing I want from you...

213
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:04,132
...your heart.

214
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,600
Appear, Daimohn!

215
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:15,110
W-What's this!?

216
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,205
Uhenshu!

217
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,986
Do you follow your deadlines?

218
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:31,193
Autograph session!

219
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,356
Are you all right?

220
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:34,659
I-I'm sorry.

221
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:38,096
Don't say you're sorry. We're friends.

222
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:43,266
What's wrong, Usagi?

223
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:50,936
You take care of Hotaru!

224
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:51,970
Oh, got it!

225
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,617
Hotaru, we're changing our plans!

226
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:57,984
Since the autograph session is
already over, let's go to the arcade!

227
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:03,591
MOON COSMIC POWER...

228
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:06,027
MAKE UP!

229
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:41,463
Hold it right there!

230
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:44,399
There are people who haven't
gotten their autographs yet!

231
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:46,994
Those who harm handsome
people in this world...

232
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:50,905
For love and justice,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

233
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:52,465
I, Sailor Moon...

234
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:57,703
...will punish you in the name of the moon!

235
00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:00,547
You're here again? You're just a pest!

236
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,142
Uhenshu, get rid of her!

237
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:03,550
All right, editor-in-chief.

238
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,849
Who's the editor-in-chief?

239
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:06,219
Just hurry up and get rid of her!

240
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,158
Ultimate attack!
WHITE MANUSCRIPT HELL!

241
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,763
Next up is photocomposition!

242
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:25,866
I can't move!

243
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:30,378
Cut and paste!
Snip, snip...

244
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:34,843
Wait a minute?
What are you planning to do?

245
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:36,512
Make sure to get a good snipping of her!

246
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,014
Hey!!

247
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,253
DEAD SCREAM...

248
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:53,526
Pluto.

249
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,531
Leave the fighting to us.

250
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,532
Uranus! Neptune!

251
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:00,373
Thanks.

252
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,537
Hurry up and get away from here!

253
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:05,546
Sheesh, why do they
crop up one after another!?

254
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:11,619
DEEP...

255
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,122
...SUBMERGE!

256
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:18,660
I'm all right even in sudden storms!

257
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:20,527
I'm telling you to run!

258
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:21,428
Why...?

259
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:24,127
G nibs, round nibs, kabla nibs!

260
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,894
Why? WHY!?

261
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:29,462
- We're comrades, we're both Soldiers!
- You're in the way!

262
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:32,307
MANUSCRIPT HELL!

263
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,904
WORLD...

264
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:39,313
...SHAKING!

265
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:45,646
The sudden strength right before a deadline!

266
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,648
Borderline... safe!

267
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:51,153
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

268
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:56,527
Sailor Venus!

269
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,500
Sailor Mars!

270
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,162
Sailor Jupiter!

271
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:02,170
Sailor Mercury!

272
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:05,335
The Sailor Team is here!

273
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,467
W-When did they...?

274
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,499
Guys!

275
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,171
Uranus, guys...

276
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:10,645
Tuxedo Mask!

277
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:14,173
Our individual ability
might be inferior to you.

278
00:18:15,018 --> 00:18:18,215
But Sailor Moon has comrades
who combine their forces to fight...

279
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,217
Sheesh, why do they all get together to...

280
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,249
What should we do?

281
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:26,819
Oh, geez, just get rid of
all of them as a bunch!

282
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:28,797
But, if there are this many...

283
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:30,993
What? You have your prized weapons!

284
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,763
But I used up all of them...

285
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:34,737
- You're no good!
- Now, Sailor Moon!

286
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:35,362
Oh, okay!

287
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:40,041
CRISIS...

288
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,510
MAKE UP!

289
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:13,541
RAINBOW...

290
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:15,101
...MOON...

291
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,773
...HEART ACHE!

292
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,885
See ya. I'm leaving the rest to you.

293
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:27,913
W-Wait a-- Wait!

294
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,791
Stick to your deadlines!!

295
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:50,204
Thanks, guys.

296
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:54,575
I didn't want to help out someone
who ditches their study group...

297
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:56,813
I apologize for that.

298
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:59,879
If Chibiusa is with her friend, let's contact her.

299
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:02,221
I'm sure she's worried right now.

300
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,462
Oh, so you guys went to Crown Arcade.

301
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,827
We had so much fun!

302
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:11,630
You know, Hotaru had never
gone to an arcade before!

303
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:16,230
You forgot that we were fighting, didn't you?

304
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,468
Her family seems to be rather complicated...

305
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,840
...but she seems like a good girl.

306
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:25,007
Yeah. I want to be better friends with her!

307
00:20:25,315 --> 00:20:27,749
Hotaru...

308
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:34,749
