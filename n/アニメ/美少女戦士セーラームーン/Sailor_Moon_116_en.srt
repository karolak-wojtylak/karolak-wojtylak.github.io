1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,362
A beautiful flower has thorns...

2
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:07,031
Just kidding -- I didn't mean me!

3
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:09,563
A rose always comes with thorns.

4
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:12,543
But the flower is beautiful
and calms the spirit down!

5
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:15,570
Hey, you over there who stomps
down on such feelings for flowers!

6
00:00:15,614 --> 00:00:19,983
I, Sailor Moon, will punish you
in the name of the moon!

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,331
How about this?

8
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,569
It's cute!

9
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,071
Mamo-chan, thank you!

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,169
Why is Chibiusa the only
one who gets all the stuff!.?

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,145
I can't help it.
It's because she has a picnic.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,272
Yeah, yeah!

13
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,077
Why are you agreeing, Luna?

14
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:53,075
Sheesh, it's no use taking
such a petty thing out on Luna...

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,178
That's right!

16
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,416
I'm not a backpack...

17
00:00:56,457 --> 00:01:01,156
I know! Mamo-chan, let's go on
a picnic, too! Just the two of us!

18
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,087
Oh, come on... Come on!

19
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,529
No fair!

20
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,931
- Me, too, me, too! Me, too!!
- Let's go, Mamo-chan! Let's go, Mamo-chan!

21
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,798
Hey, now...

22
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,102
All right, all right!

23
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,545
Oh, Hotaru!

24
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,047
Wait, Hotaru!

25
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,312
Don't run away...

26
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,791
We're friends, right!?

27
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,589
Friends...?

28
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,789
That's right!
We are... right!?

29
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,889
Chibiusa...

30
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,002
That girl...

31
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,630
She must have some big
reason behind all this...

32
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:49,267
Haruka also said that I shouldn't
let Chibiusa near that girl, too...

33
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,801
But she's not a bad girl!
She can't be! Right?

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,077
Hotaru...

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,590
Release my powers!

36
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,758
Hurry!

37
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,596
Can you not hear the voices
of time calling for me!?

38
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:19,271
Let us hurry,
using the pure hearts of humans...

39
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,443
You are...?

40
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,176
Um... Please, give this to Hotaru!

41
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,608
Good-bye!

42
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,882
Kaori, that...?

43
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,385
It's that girl again...

44
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,624
She told me to give this to you, Hotaru...

45
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,996
"Hotaru, let's go on a picnic tomorrow."

46
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:56,442
"I'll make plenty of lunch!
So, Hotaru, you come with this backpack!

47
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,137
From Chibiusa."

48
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,378
So selfish...

49
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,508
She knows that you're a frail girl, too.

50
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,381
How wonderful!

51
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,720
Papa...

52
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,918
Since I can't spend much time
with you with all of my research...

53
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,393
You go and have as
much fun as you want.

54
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,899
We're going now!

55
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,262
Is this all food...?

56
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,502
Yeah! I got up early to make it all!

57
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,908
Will it fit in the trunk...?

58
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,012
Hotaru can't come after all, I guess...

59
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,916
Chibiusa!

60
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,849
Hotaru!

61
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:49,027
You can come to the picnic!

62
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,042
This place is huge!

63
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,208
Woohoo!

64
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,043
Hotaru! Usagi! Hurry, hurry!

65
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,045
Wait for me, Chibiusa!

66
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,124
Ready, set, toss!

67
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,828
Tie, set, toss!

68
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,234
Tie, set, toss!

69
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,709
I told them to not get near her...

70
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,235
Are you saying she has something to
do with our enemy, the Death Busters?

71
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,978
I'm not sure... but I have
a bad feeling about this.

72
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,248
I feel the presence of
something tremendously evil.

73
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,588
But... it looks fun...

74
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,419
Are you all right?

75
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,926
Y-Yes...

76
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,200
A graduate of my school works here.

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,437
He's a botanist, with his lifework
being his research on roses.

78
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,311
Wait, Chibiusa!

79
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:13,938
Catch me if you can, Usagi!
You're slower than a tortoise!

80
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,947
You did that on purpose, didn't you!?

81
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,688
Yes, Professor?

82
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:27,449
Mimet, what is your
favorite color for roses?

83
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,954
Oh, my...! If I could have any,
it would be a million red roses...!

84
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:40,195
Improving and breeding of roses is a job
that requires good sense and patience!

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,007
There apparently is a botanist with
good results in that field, I take it?

86
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:51,516
That MUST be an owner of a pure heart!

87
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,057
The target has been determined.

88
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:05,724
All right... Let me make a
Daimohn most suited for that man.

89
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,825
I'm counting on you.

90
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,580
Ubara!

91
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,605
- Amazing...
- This is beautiful!

92
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,843
There are so many of them!

93
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,687
Yo! Is that you, Mamoru?

94
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,656
Sir!

95
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,784
How've you been?

96
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,352
You've still got beautiful women with you!

97
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,854
"Still"...?

98
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,956
I-It's a joke!

99
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:13,863
Sir!

100
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,793
Papa!

101
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,397
Mama's lunch!

102
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,736
The main dish is a croquet?

103
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,766
- You're right!
- Correct!

104
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,444
So many...

105
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,380
There's even more of them...

106
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,849
Oh, Professor!

107
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,876
You have to use proper
sense to choose the targets!

108
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,390
And stop!

109
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,619
From here, you will help Mama back home!

110
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,824
Okay!

111
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:46,833
Don't trip!

112
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,358
Bye bye!

113
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,401
You're kidding...!

114
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,972
It's a croquet!

115
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,609
How goes the research
for new types of roses?

116
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,781
Oh, I think I'm almost there!

117
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,519
Hotaru, don't be bashful and eat up!

118
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,355
Okay.

119
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,354
Here!

120
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,191
Chibiusa! You have to eat
the bell peppers, too!

121
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,325
Mamo-chan isn't eating them, either!

122
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,392
What was that?

123
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,801
Mamo-chan! Eat! You have to eat!

124
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,533
But, you know...

125
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,733
EAT!

126
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,971
All right, I understand...

127
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,973
Now it's your turn, Chibiusa!

128
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,480
EAT!

129
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,482
A-All right!

130
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,846
Hotaru, you don't think the lunch is yummy?

131
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,878
It's not that...

132
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:48,486
I was just thinking how I haven't eaten
like this with Papa in quite a while...

133
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,528
There are times when
adults are hellishly busy.

134
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:02,133
It's more fun to spend that time playing with
your friends than to complain about it!

135
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,506
Right!?

136
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,343
What are you doing, Chibiusa...!?

137
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,651
Better! That guy is much better!!

138
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,391
Appear, Dai--

139
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,463
I'm counting on you, Mimet.

140
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,869
P-Professor!

141
00:09:55,061 --> 00:10:00,158
Almost every variety of rose growing in
Japan are planted in this greenhouse!

142
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,600
Amazing... and they're all so beautiful!

143
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,370
Are you tired?

144
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,099
No...

145
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,001
They're beautiful, aren't they?

146
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,475
Other than these, many
different types of roses have...

147
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,944
...been grown thanks to
improvements made to them.

148
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,970
Improvements...!

149
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:20,447
It's hard to believe that an old man
like him improved these...

150
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:26,624
It would be better to just let it go free, and
let it bloom wherever it wanted to bloom...

151
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,322
Hotaru...

152
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:34,025
These are tropical plants.
Come over here.

153
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,226
Let's go!

154
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,998
I'm tired... You can go on ahead.

155
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,207
Um...

156
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:55,085
Can you tell me the name of this flower?

157
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,147
- Oh, I don't know...
- You should ask the researcher over there!

158
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:02,052
Oh, I totally thought that
HE was the researcher...

159
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,423
You look so intelligent!

160
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,958
If you don't mind, how about we
have a conversation in private?

161
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,561
I'm sorry...

162
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,038
But I'm here to spend time with my family.

163
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,107
O-Oh, are they your sisters?

164
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,874
No, they're my future wife and child.

165
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,040
Now, excuse me...

166
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,648
W-What was that!?

167
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,051
Fine, I will have to take
the pure heart by force...!

168
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,683
The heart of the botanist...

169
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,355
The heart--

170
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,765
The future wife... wife... wife... Wife, is it?

171
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,963
It's not something to be that thrilled
about now, after all this time...

172
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,301
I'll be with Hotaru!

173
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,068
Yeah... Be at her side.

174
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,573
Yeah.

175
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,584
I should go back...
before anything happens...

176
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,439
W-What is this?
It's hailing out of season?

177
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,341
It's coming down pretty hard...

178
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,348
Oh, no, this is bad!

179
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,278
Oh, no! We have a problem!

180
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,914
Let's help!

181
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:38,582
Yeah!

182
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,123
Hotaru!

183
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,128
Hotaru--!

184
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,277
Dammit!

185
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,284
Thanks!

186
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,784
It's all right...

187
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,317
I have to protect these
saplings, if nothing else...

188
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,692
I was finally able to make a species
that was strong against illness.

189
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,822
Strong against illness...?

190
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,699
Improvements aren't just
about making it more beautiful!

191
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,311
Are you all right?

192
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,542
Hold yourself steady...!

193
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,548
Who is it...!?

194
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,715
Work is work.

195
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,517
The path to the chief executive is
more important than romance!

196
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,582
I'll take the old man's pure heart!

197
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,925
Appear, Daimohn!

198
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,367
Ubara! Bara bara!

199
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,202
Petals with no luster...

200
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,108
Too much fertilizer.

201
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,347
S-Shut up!

202
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,941
Hurry up and finish your job!

203
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,543
W-What are you doing!?

204
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,713
Hey, stop it!

205
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,296
It's a Daimohn!

206
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,460
MOON PRISM POWER...

207
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,901
MAKE UP!

208
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:43,041
Those who don't take good care of flowers!

209
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,482
That's the type of people
who will ruin the Earth!

210
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:52,522
For love and justice, an apprentice
to a pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

211
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,856
Sailor Chibi Moon!

212
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,687
In the name of the future moon...

213
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,994
...I'll punish you!

214
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,062
A pesky little girl!

215
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,432
Ubara!

216
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,836
Ubara! Bara bara!

217
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,013
Attacking with a rose is a move
that I use as a last resort.

218
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,609
I am troubled by copycats.

219
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,517
D-Damn you!

220
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:26,013
It's too early to be so angry.
The main event finally appears.

221
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,089
Sorry to keep you waiting!

222
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,067
For love and justice...

223
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,093
...the pretty solder in a sailor suit!

224
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,108
Sailor Moon!

225
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:49,307
In the name of the moon, I'll punish you!

226
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,310
Ubara, kill every last one of them!

227
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,792
THE RED ROSE OF PASSION!

228
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,266
PINK SUGAR...

229
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,330
...HEART...

230
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,638
...ATTACK!

231
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,383
What are you doing,
losing to a little girl like that!?

232
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,817
Beautiful roses are full of thorns!

233
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,889
EMBRACE OF ROSES!

234
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,864
Give them a good squeeze!

235
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,361
Oh, no!

236
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,095
Take this!

237
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,668
Are you all right?

238
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,801
What are you doing!?

239
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,404
There's no way you would
lose to girls like them!

240
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,411
Damn you...!

241
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:24,065
Jealousy is the meaning
behind yellow roses!!

242
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,045
W-What is this!?

243
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,949
Oh... Tuxedo Mask!!

244
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,583
T-This hurts!

245
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,597
I did it! I finally did it!

246
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,280
I'm withering!

247
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,883
What's wrong, Ubara?

248
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,125
Now, Sailor Moon!

249
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:21,862
Yeah!

250
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,762
CRISIS...

251
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,205
MAKE UP!

252
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:01,134
RAINBOW...

253
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,607
...MOON...

254
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,475
...HEART ACHE!

255
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,277
I'm already withered!

256
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,982
Bara bara!

257
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,131
That's why I wasn't too
thrilled about doing this!

258
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,181
What was that?
I felt a strong power for a moment...

259
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,951
It's an eerie pulse of darkness...!

260
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,289
Please be careful, Small Lady...

261
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,398
Hotaru!

262
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,931
I'm so glad!

263
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,438
Chibiusa...?

264
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,430
Papa! Are you all right?

265
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,465
Oh, I'm fine! I'm fine!

266
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,136
But... did I have a dream?

267
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,636
It was a terrible storm!

268
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,311
But let's come here again!

269
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,410
Yes...

270
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,410
