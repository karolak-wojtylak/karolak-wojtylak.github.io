1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,630
A flower's life is short,
and is mostly filled with pain.

2
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:12,041
I can't forgive using such
pretty flowers for bad things!

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,035
You're being rude to those
good flower shop owners!

4
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:19,542
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,490
S-Stop!

6
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,869
Farewell, idiot.

7
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,631
NOOOOO!!!

8
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:31,603
F-Fighting amongst themselves...?

9
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:34,442
What in the world is going on?

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,811
Super Sailor Moon!?

11
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:36,644
Are you all right!

12
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:38,172
Hang in there!

13
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:43,821
To eradicate their own ally...

14
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:45,118
Horrible people they are...

15
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:47,421
We can't be too idealistic, either.

16
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:49,852
Let's go.

17
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:54,195
We must defeat the Messiah of
Silence as quickly as possible.

18
00:00:56,402 --> 00:00:58,700
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto!

19
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:00,162
Wait!

20
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:10,681
Wait!

21
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,984
Don't you lay your hands on Hotaru!

22
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:15,044
Hotaru isn't a bad girl!

23
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:18,256
I believe that there is another way.

24
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,656
That's right!
There's got to be another way!

25
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:24,288
No matter how many ideals you line up
with your mouth, this battle will not end...

26
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:28,226
But if all of us think together,
there has to be a good way...

27
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:30,292
It's too early to give up.

28
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:31,634
Uranus...

29
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:33,332
Haruka, we...

30
00:01:33,372 --> 00:01:34,304
It's no use!

31
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,067
We have no time for ideals...

32
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,478
Both the Messiah of Silence and
Sailor Saturn will be sealed away by us!

33
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:43,072
Compared to you...

34
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:45,208
...we long for a different world.

35
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,582
You can't!

36
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,985
Hotaru is my friend!

37
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:51,956
I believe in her!
Hotaru is not at fault!!

38
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,823
I'll protect Hotaru!

39
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,952
I will protect her!

40
00:01:57,296 --> 00:02:00,060
I will protect her...

41
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,567
Chibiusa...

42
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:09,471
Pure hearts... are they here yet?

43
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:11,967
I am terribly sorry...

44
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,239
Please wait a while longer.

45
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:16,274
Pure hearts...

46
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:19,876
And lots of them.
Unless I get a hold of them...

47
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,013
...it is impossible for me
to be fully awakened.

48
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:27,754
I will not forgive anyone who
gets in the way of my revival!

49
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,464
Chibiusa...

50
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:36,962
Messiah!

51
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:40,235
No need to worry...

52
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:41,830
Just collect...

53
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,273
...the pure hearts.

54
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:44,469
Yes!

55
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,021
Yes, this is Telulu's desk at Witches 5.

56
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,187
Hello, it's me...

57
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,093
Professor!

58
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,531
I just glanced through you report.

59
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:12,060
I have gotten to like your plan to
use plants to steal the pure hearts.

60
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:14,072
Thank you very much.

61
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:18,975
The plans that use daimohns
have been failing as of late.

62
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,178
I thought it was interesting to change
how we approach things a bit for once.

63
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:24,375
I'm counting on you...

64
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,644
... Telulu.

65
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:28,175
Leave it to me.

66
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:33,819
The plans are completely ready.

67
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:35,827
Then start the operation!

68
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:37,226
Yes!

69
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,054
Professor.

70
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,227
Kaori...

71
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:44,498
I brought you some coffee.

72
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:46,971
Thank you.

73
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:48,870
What's the matter...?

74
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:51,570
Lately, everything has been worrying me...

75
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,100
My shoulders feel rather...

76
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:54,737
I'll massage them.

77
00:03:55,614 --> 00:03:57,479
Sorry to trouble you so much all the time.

78
00:03:57,516 --> 00:03:59,006
No...

79
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:03,681
You perfectly support my
Job as my secretary.

80
00:04:03,722 --> 00:04:05,189
But of course.

81
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:08,751
You revived me after I died
the first time, Professor.

82
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:12,355
I'll do anything to be of use to you...

83
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:13,797
Because I...

84
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:18,930
It really is a shame to use all
of your skills just as a secretary...

85
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:23,130
You know what I'm talking about...
Right, Kaori?

86
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:26,906
I want you to go back into the field...

87
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,048
But... I...

88
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:32,550
I'm counting on you...

89
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:39,288
Professor... I...!!

90
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,393
You are the only one I can count on...

91
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:43,793
Kaorinite...

92
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:50,759
Professor...

93
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:15,326
How about some flowers?

94
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:18,291
A plant that doesn't need water or fertilizers!

95
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,798
How about a Telulun,
a flower that brings happiness?

96
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,360
In two or three days,
a cute pink flower will bloom!

97
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:29,170
Now, about the price --
a special introductory price of...

98
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,836
Just 1 0 yen!
How about that!?

99
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:34,471
Wow, that's cheap!
I'll take it!

100
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:36,003
Would you like a Telulun?

101
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:37,072
How about a Telulun...?

102
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:40,051
Telulun? I've never heard of such a flower...

103
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,975
W-Wait a minute!

104
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:18,086
I can't take it anymore!
I can't walk another step!

105
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:20,956
What is she bolting out like that for?
She's such a bullet-girl!

106
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:22,426
Usagi!

107
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,860
What?!

108
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:26,296
Aren't you worried about Chibiusa?

109
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:30,268
Worried...? She just said she was
going on a walk when she left!

110
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:33,533
Why do I have to do something like this!?

111
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:34,766
Because...

112
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:38,265
She seemed to be deeply worried
about Hotaru or something...

113
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,244
So I'm just a little worried.

114
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,077
I don't think she's "just"
out on a walk, though...

115
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:44,844
You're right...

116
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,547
She sure is a troublesome child.

117
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:48,416
Usagi...

118
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:51,753
But you and your daughter
really have similar personalities...

119
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,848
You say one thing too many!

120
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:55,451
I can't help it!
You really are mother and daughter!

121
00:06:55,494 --> 00:06:57,621
Why can't you end things on a good note!?

122
00:06:57,663 --> 00:07:01,394
That lethargic attitude makes
me want to say one last thing!

123
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:02,400
What did you say!?

124
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:06,427
Let's cut it out... both of you...

125
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,932
What!?

126
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:11,670
Y-You know... I just realized this...

127
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,699
What?

128
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:13,575
Ahead of here...

129
00:07:13,612 --> 00:07:14,670
What about it?

130
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:17,580
...is Mugen Academy, maybe?

131
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:18,878
Huh?

132
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:27,317
Looks like nobody is here...

133
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:31,586
Just you wait, Hotaru...
I'll make sure to save you.

134
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,258
All right... I'll now sneak in...

135
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:36,096
...to investigate!

136
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:40,638
What are you doing...?

137
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,304
It's dangerous for you to go
to such a place by yourself!.

138
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:48,235
That place might be the
Death Busters' headquarters!

139
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,872
I know that...

140
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,075
Then, why?

141
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,585
I'm sure that Hotaru is
captured by bad guys!

142
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,554
Hotaru is in Mugen Academy!

143
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:58,579
Even I can tell something like that!

144
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:01,058
I want to...

145
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:03,186
...save Hotaru.

146
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:04,957
Chibiusa...

147
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:14,528
Everyone feels the same way.

148
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:17,974
We will definitely save Hotaru...

149
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,409
Definitely...?

150
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:20,776
Yeah...

151
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:23,338
Leave it to your big sisters!

152
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:26,840
All right!

153
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:38,893
Chibiusa...

154
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,866
What am I doing in a place like this...?

155
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,368
Chibiusa...

156
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:50,369
The power to absorb water
in the atmosphere into its body...?

157
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,843
Impossible!

158
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:55,142
To think that a plant like this exists...

159
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,310
That strange incident where
massive amounts of plants wilted...

160
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:02,878
Perhaps it has something
to do with this flower...?

161
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:03,751
What...!?

162
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:24,776
The Garnet Rod...

163
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,244
...it protected me!?

164
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:30,508
Hey, miss over there.

165
00:09:30,983 --> 00:09:34,510
This is a flower that brings happiness.
Would you like one?

166
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:36,748
A flower that brings happiness?

167
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:39,455
This is the last one I have.

168
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,425
So, I'll give it to you.

169
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,223
A flower that brings happiness...

170
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:46,330
It will probably go with Chibiusa well.

171
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:48,799
Thank you.

172
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,961
First stage is now complete.

173
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:54,968
Chibiusa...

174
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,790
Yes!

175
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,200
Who is it?

176
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,435
Hotaru!

177
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,370
Chibiusa.

178
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:31,001
You're all right!
I wanted to see you!

179
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:32,237
Me, too...

180
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:33,710
Chibiusa...

181
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:35,544
A guest?

182
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:37,071
Hotaru!

183
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,077
What's with that attitude!?

184
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,054
I wanted... to give you this, Chibiusa.

185
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:45,283
Thanks!

186
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:47,087
I heard it's a flower that brings happiness.

187
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:50,059
I thought it was perfect for you, Chibiusa.

188
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:52,586
It goes with you well, too, Hotaru!

189
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,396
It's not for me...

190
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:56,924
That's not true!

191
00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:01,099
I hurt other people without knowing it.

192
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,868
There's another selfinside me
that I don't know about.

193
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,936
And that's why I'm afraid to make friends...

194
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,509
But... you ease those
feelings of mine, Chibiusa...

195
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:15,782
So, I...

196
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:16,685
Hotaru!

197
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,314
Hotaru!

198
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:19,619
I...

199
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:22,388
I want your pure heart...

200
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:24,720
Hotaru...?

201
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:28,359
What's wrong, Hotaru?

202
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,458
Chibiusa!

203
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:33,428
Stop!!

204
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,637
Hotaru?

205
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:40,945
What did I...Just now...?

206
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,449
Chibiusa, save me!

207
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:47,247
I'm... afraid...

208
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:49,220
It'll be all right.

209
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:53,255
I'm here to pick you up, Hotaru...

210
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:54,850
You can't!

211
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:56,087
Get out of the way.

212
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:58,420
Chibiusa!

213
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:01,056
Chibiusa!!

214
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:02,123
Hotaru!

215
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:08,568
Hotaru...

216
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:11,642
There's no doubt -- that was Kaorinite.

217
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,305
But I thought we defeated her...

218
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:17,907
But we couldn't confirm
that Kaorinite died at the scene.

219
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,407
- But...
- I couldn't protect Hotaru...

220
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:24,818
She was relying on me, too...

221
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:27,654
Don't blame your self so much!

222
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:30,687
But... I couldn't be of any aid to her.

223
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:31,923
Hello...

224
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:33,923
Setsuna...

225
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:34,932
Plu...

226
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,930
Small Lady!

227
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,839
S-Setsuna?

228
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,080
What are you doing!?

229
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:55,018
Hotaru came all the way
over here to give it to me!

230
00:12:55,053 --> 00:13:00,958
That means that Hotaru might be
after your pure heart, Small Lady.

231
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,135
This is about all it does while it's a bud...

232
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:13,637
...but when it blooms,
it will start to abduct people's pure hearts.

233
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:17,569
If all the flowers that are now all
over town started blooming at once...

234
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:18,871
Oh, no!!

235
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,208
It's different from what
they've been doing until now!

236
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:26,377
Perhaps there is a situation now that
requires them to have many pure hearts.

237
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:27,811
But what should we do...?

238
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:29,787
We must get rid of it at the source.

239
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:31,652
Let me do it!

240
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:36,021
I'll prove that Hotaru
has nothing to do with it!

241
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,564
Telulun is being sold at that store.

242
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:45,831
Then, for starters--

243
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:47,498
Let's go around to the back entrance!

244
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:50,736
I was just about to say that!

245
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:52,405
W-Wait a minute!

246
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:56,409
Welcome!

247
00:13:57,315 --> 00:14:00,751
Considering how many I got all over town,
my preparations are complete!

248
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:05,589
First, I'll take the pure
hearts of the people here!

249
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:23,938
Dear customers...

250
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:26,134
You are very lucky people!

251
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:29,477
To be able to purchase Telulun in bloom!

252
00:14:29,514 --> 00:14:32,813
The price is your pure heart.

253
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:36,052
What are you!?

254
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:54,434
I guess it's just like what you said, Setsuna...

255
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:56,202
Impossible...

256
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:59,335
But Hotaru didn't know anything about this.

257
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:00,503
Let's save everyone!

258
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:06,608
MOON COSMIC POWER...

259
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,744
MAKE UP!

260
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:13,149
PLUTO PLANET POWER...

261
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:15,421
MAKE UP!

262
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,261
MOON PRISM POWER...

263
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:20,628
MAKE UP!

264
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,457
Come on!

265
00:15:56,401 --> 00:16:00,394
A flower's life is short,
and is mostly filled with pain.

266
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:03,464
I can't forgive using such flowers
for bad things just as they bloom!

267
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:07,840
For love and justice,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

268
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,471
Sailor Moon!

269
00:16:11,116 --> 00:16:14,711
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

270
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:16,414
Sailor Soldiers, huh...

271
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,854
To find out about
this place so quickly...

272
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,414
You aren't as stupid as I thought.

273
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,891
You're the stupid one!

274
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:24,725
Because of you, Hotaru was
being suspected for all of this!

275
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:29,591
Shut up, brat!
I guess I'll take your pure hearts as well.

276
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:35,062
It's no use to escape.

277
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:37,006
This shop is filled with Telulun.

278
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:39,875
I'll blow all of those things away!

279
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:43,712
Lend me your powers, Pink Moon Stick!

280
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:47,115
PINK SUGAR HEART ATTACK!

281
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,754
I was curious, but that's so weak!

282
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:57,557
I'll get rid of you first, then!

283
00:16:58,863 --> 00:16:59,591
Chibiusa!

284
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:00,529
Small Lady!

285
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:02,765
Please...

286
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:08,066
All right!

287
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,767
How impudent!

288
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:16,711
Plu!

289
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:28,992
Flowers are supposed
to bring serenity to humans.

290
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,427
I will not allow using them for evil.

291
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:33,294
Tuxedo Mask!

292
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:36,630
Sailor Moon, purify these flowers!

293
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:38,693
Right!

294
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:40,728
CRISIS...

295
00:17:40,772 --> 00:17:43,104
MAKE UP!

296
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:14,330
RAINBOW...

297
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:15,771
...MOON...

298
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:19,368
...HEART ACHE!

299
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:25,446
What!?

300
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:39,821
My dear flowers...
How dare you!?

301
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:42,823
Don't assume that you're out of the woods!

302
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:51,034
You'll regret making me angry.

303
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:58,210
This Hyper-Telulun will be your opponent.

304
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:01,343
It's a monster that reacts
only to pure hearts!

305
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:03,914
This is a scary one!

306
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:09,552
After taking out the pure heart, it self-destructs
along with the owner of the heart.

307
00:19:09,594 --> 00:19:12,427
I'll leave you to go against it.

308
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:16,264
I have to deliver this to the professor!

309
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:17,858
I won't let you!

310
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:27,033
Drats!!

311
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:30,748
What are you doing!?

312
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,247
Hey, let go!

313
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:47,253
STOP IT!

314
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:55,805
A student handbook from Mugen Academy?

315
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,171
Lulu Teluno?

316
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,142
Telulu!

317
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:02,635
Mugen Academy is fishy after all...

318
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,977
Plu!

319
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:05,978
Hang in there, Plu!

320
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:11,154
Small Lady...

321
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:12,281
I'm so glad...

322
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,253
I'm sorry.
You got into this mess because of me.

323
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,057
But Plu...

324
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:22,192
I still believe Hotaru...

325
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,726
Because she's my dear friend.

326
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,603
She's my friend...

327
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:35,603
