1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,127
An evil trap by Eugeal!!

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:08,401
There were talismans inside Uranus
and Neptune's pure heart crystals!

3
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:14,341
Haruka, Michiru -- don't die!!

4
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:19,840
Just watch! Even if there aren't any
talismans, I WILL save the world!!

5
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,928
Uranus...

6
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,902
What should I do?

7
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:38,066
How can I return these
talismans to your bodies?

8
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:40,333
Buns-head...

9
00:00:40,376 --> 00:00:43,277
No, Sailor Moon...

10
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:46,611
I don't care what happens to us...

11
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,710
Please, protect these talismans...

12
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:54,883
And find the one remaining talisman.

13
00:00:55,158 --> 00:00:56,318
Haruka!

14
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:07,263
Hand the Grail to
the legendary Messiah...

15
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,102
The legendary Messiah...?

16
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,608
Who is that...?

17
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:19,480
Our savior, who can rescue us
from the time of destruction...

18
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:24,452
...the horrible world of silence...

19
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:41,496
When the Messiah gets a hold
of the Grail, the world...

20
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:44,062
...will be saved...

21
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,144
NOOOOOO!!

22
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,329
I can hear it.

23
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:12,095
It's faint, but I hear a pulse!

24
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:15,360
Dammit! How can we
return these talismans...

25
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:19,272
...these crystals of their
pure hearts... back inside them!?

26
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:35,916
Sure enough, I have
received the two talismans.

27
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:37,822
You can't do that!

28
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:43,532
MOON COSMIC POWER...

29
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:46,091
MAKE UP!

30
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:23,332
Those two talismans are the crystals
of Haruka and Michiru's pure hearts!

31
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:24,304
Give them back!!

32
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:25,997
FIRE...

33
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:31,102
...BUSTER!!

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,361
How is the power of Fire Buster II, with
its pending practicality model patent...

35
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:51,662
...now with even more
firepower than before?

36
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:57,563
SHINE AQUA...

37
00:03:57,606 --> 00:03:59,665
...ILLUSION!

38
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:06,472
I can't believe Shine Aqua
Illusion didn't work!

39
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,676
An eye for an eye, a fame for a fame!

40
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:16,151
BURNING...

41
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:18,717
...MANDALA!

42
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:23,158
Mars, it's no good!

43
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,463
The fire grew even bigger!

44
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:32,471
Your attacks will not be able to
extinguish the fame of my Fire Buster.

45
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:40,077
Now you'll all burn to a crisp,
into crispy black charred masses!

46
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:42,246
See you!

47
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:46,253
If we don't think of something,
we'll all die!

48
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,250
LUNA-P...

49
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:53,488
...FIRE EXTINGUISHER!

50
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:58,194
Sailor Chibi Moon!

51
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:00,225
Tuxedo Mask!

52
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:09,543
I was wondering what
was gonna happen to us!

53
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:11,842
Whew, I'm glad we made it in time.

54
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:16,117
Thank you, Sailor Chibi Moon,
Tuxedo Mask.

55
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,077
Hurry, the talismans...

56
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,950
Right!

57
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:27,451
Wait for me, Uranus, Neptune!

58
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:32,627
I will make sure... I will make
sure to get the talismans back!

59
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,286
I... I was able to
obtain TWO talismans!!

60
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:57,121
Damn those pesky girls!

61
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:02,123
STICKY LIQUID!

62
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,059
What!?

63
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,994
M-My legs...

64
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,404
...are stuck.

65
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:14,899
Take this!

66
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,339
Now... there!

67
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,848
And... there!

68
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,226
See you later!

69
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:35,323
Watch out, Sailor Moon!

70
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:36,160
Eugeal is...!

71
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:39,159
W-What should I do? What should I do?
What should I do? What should I do?

72
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:46,273
Sorry, guys!

73
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:47,572
Sorry!

74
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,771
I'm really sorry! I'm sorry!
There! And there!

75
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:55,144
She's just like the
white rabbit of Inaba...

76
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,209
Does that make us sharks?

77
00:06:58,187 --> 00:06:58,812
D-Did it hurt!?

78
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:01,755
I won't forgive you if you
let Eugeal get away now!

79
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,189
Do your best, Sailor Moon!

80
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:05,056
We'll make sure to follow you!

81
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,794
I have to save them!

82
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:19,796
I have to get the crystals of
Uranus and Neptune's pure hearts...

83
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:23,812
I have to get those talismans back!

84
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:49,202
So you're here!

85
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:51,832
I can't forgive you for
stepping on someone's heart...

86
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,502
...and then trying to do
away with their life as well!

87
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:56,241
For love and justice...

88
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:58,508
The pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

89
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,509
Sailor Moon!

90
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,784
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!!

91
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:17,624
Acting tough, are we?

92
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:24,805
I do hope you remember that I defended
myself against your ultimate attack before.

93
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:30,642
It's obvious that I'm much
more powerful than you are.

94
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:36,049
If you don't want to die, it would be
better for you to run away right now!

95
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:41,045
Even if my body breaks, I'll make sure
that those talismans are back in my hands!

96
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:05,680
MOON SPIRAL...

97
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,080
FIRE...

98
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:12,349
...HEART ATTACK!!

99
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:16,548
...BUSTER!!

100
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,633
Just like I told you...

101
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:30,435
Fire Buster II is a
wonderful piece of equipment.

102
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:33,032
I made it by making
alterations to Fire Buster I.

103
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:37,478
That weak little attack of
yours is nothing against it!

104
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:23,020
Sailor Moon, you have gotten
in my way so many times before...

105
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,017
Today, I will give my thanks
for all of those times!

106
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,363
FIRE...

107
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:39,806
Hold it right there!

108
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,671
Who are you!?

109
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,511
Miss Setsuna Meioh?

110
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,916
Eugeal, I will have you
return the talismans to us.

111
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:52,045
What!?

112
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:54,055
Sailor Moon!

113
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:55,920
Who are you?

114
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,392
PLUTO PLANET POWER...

115
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:00,827
MAKE UP!

116
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:17,308
You're...!

117
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:18,779
Sailor Pluto!

118
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:21,014
It has been a while.

119
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,277
Why are you here?

120
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:26,281
The remaining talisman...

121
00:11:27,156 --> 00:11:29,283
...is in my possession!

122
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,200
This is perfect...

123
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:43,432
I don't have to go
searching for the third one.

124
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:52,439
I will not let you evil beings
get a hold of the talismans!!

125
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:06,221
Oh, wait!

126
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:50,732
Uranus!

127
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:52,000
Neptune!

128
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,509
The crystals of their pure hearts...?

129
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:07,154
They're going back...

130
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:17,564
I'm so glad...

131
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:28,239
The true talismans...

132
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:30,905
...didn't have to sacrifice anyone...

133
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:38,180
Talismans... have this
much divine power?

134
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:05,008
W-What just happened!?

135
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,786
Depending on who uses it...

136
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,027
...it is said that it can lead the
world to destruction or salvation...

137
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:28,025
...it is the Holy Grail
that has infinite power.

138
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,735
The Grail...

139
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:34,639
I'll take that!

140
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,058
I won't let you have it!

141
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:55,391
You're in my way!!

142
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:59,517
Sailor Moon is...!!

143
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:15,868
Sailor Moon!

144
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,538
Is this a new awakening!?

145
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,811
Oh? My, my, my...

146
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:23,877
FIRE BUSTER!!

147
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,367
Sailor Moon is...

148
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:44,338
...the Messiah that will save
the world from silence!?

149
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:54,845
Dammit... Sailor Moon, I will make
sure to pay you back for this!!

150
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:03,650
Chief Eugeal, your jobis over.

151
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,091
Mimet?

152
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:10,059
I've been tolerating all
of your failures until now.

153
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:12,191
But they really were
unbearable to watch.

154
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:13,633
W-What!?

155
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:18,037
You're tarnishing the name of the
Witches 5, the pride of the Death Busters!

156
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:19,665
Please die and repent for that!

157
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,701
Die? Impossible!
The battle has just begun!

158
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:32,282
T-The brakes aren't working!?

159
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,914
What!?

160
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:35,924
Snail Woman in the Station Wagon
Should Crash and Die!!

161
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:38,290
Mimet!!

162
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:48,759
Thanks for the hard work!

163
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:07,318
Sailor Moon!

164
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,321
Mamo-chan...

165
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:14,853
Are you all right!?

166
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,693
Hold yourself together!

167
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:21,327
I'm feeling really lethargic...
I'm feeling weak all over.

168
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,331
Perhaps Sailor Moon
isn't the Messiah...

169
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:31,703
The true Messiah can
use infinite power.

170
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:35,443
If she collapses from fatigue with
just this much, Sailor Moon isn't...

171
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:39,078
Then, the true Messiah
is somewhere else...

172
00:18:39,855 --> 00:18:43,791
It looks like we have
a new mission now.

173
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:15,044
Professor, the Grail has appeared!

174
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:20,886
Furthermore, the Grail has landed
in the hands of the Sailor Soldiers!

175
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:23,658
What's the matter?

176
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:25,029
Mimet...

177
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,261
It's true that the
Holy Grail has appeared.

178
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:33,434
However, it seems that someone who can
truly control the Grail has yet to appear.

179
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:39,306
If someone who could control
the Grail was really among them...

180
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:41,508
...this building of
the Death Busters...

181
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:46,953
...as well as all the Daimohn eggs,
should have crumbled into ruins.

182
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:51,917
However, look around you.
Not one crack has emerged.

183
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:58,432
Perhaps...

184
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:07,031
...there is someone who can control
the Grail for us, the Death Busters...

185
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:10,442
...somewhere amazingly close.

186
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:15,546
I see!

187
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:22,546
