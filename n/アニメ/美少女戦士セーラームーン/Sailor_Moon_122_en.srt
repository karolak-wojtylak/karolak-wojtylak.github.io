1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,069
The next national practice examination is
going to be held at Mugen Academy!?

2
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:10,007
Come to think, anything called
an exam is dominated by Ami.

3
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:11,566
I'm jealous...

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,979
But if you use words like
"slip", "fall", and "fail"...

5
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:20,384
...I, Sailor Moon, will punish
you in the name of the moon!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,627
Telulu's student handbook...

7
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:25,769
Mugen Academy, huh?

8
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:31,569
There is something there.

9
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:32,735
Yes, I'm sure of it!

10
00:00:32,777 --> 00:00:34,540
Wow!

11
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,604
Ami, you are amazing!
Just amazing!

12
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:38,712
Ami, you got...

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,516
...the highest rank in the national
practice exam, with a perfect score!?

14
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:44,077
Again?

15
00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:47,922
No, I'm not the only one at the top...

16
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:50,325
There was another girl with a perfect score.

17
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:54,354
A girl named Yui Bidoh, who is
always at the top in Mugen Academy.

18
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:56,624
Mugen Academy again...

19
00:00:56,668 --> 00:01:01,332
Hey, the next national practice examination
is held at Mugen Academy, right?

20
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:03,340
In this case, why don't we
sneak into the exam site...

21
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:05,604
...and really do a good investigation?

22
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:08,339
But we don't have a registration ticket.

23
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:09,346
That's not it.

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,848
It's not that we're going to take the exam.

25
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:14,010
All we need to do is to be at the site.

26
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:16,917
So, we don't need a registration ticket.

27
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:19,286
I'm sorry, guys.

28
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:24,284
I had been planning to take
that exam at Mugen Academy.

29
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:25,823
Oh, man!

30
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:28,024
Nothing less from our studious Ami.

31
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:53,455
There are so many people
here despite the snow...

32
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:55,550
Everyone is very studious, aren't they?

33
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:57,918
Unlike someone we know.

34
00:01:57,962 --> 00:02:00,487
Sheesh, don't say that!

35
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:07,498
We have quite a few here.

36
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:09,102
Yes.

37
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,440
Mugen Academy is becoming more
popular with its high caliber education.

38
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:15,002
Those that gathered here
are especially intelligent.

39
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,716
There are some that
don't seem that way...

40
00:02:21,753 --> 00:02:25,245
...but the enthusiasm these young individuals
have towards the entrance exams is amazing.

41
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:27,586
Professor!

42
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,524
Oh, it's you, Byruit.

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,587
It seems like your plan
is going along schedule...

44
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:35,093
Yes.

45
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:40,594
I, Byruit, will collect an immense
amount of pure hearts.

46
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:46,308
Yes. This is also a good plan to
awaken the Messiah of Silence.

47
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:50,009
Thank you for your kind words.

48
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:56,986
How about you go collect a few pure hearts,
instead of hanging all over him?

49
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:08,024
Oh, Mamo-chan.

50
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,293
Where are you going?

51
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,767
Somewhere!

52
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,815
Hotaru...!

53
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,398
Hotaru...

54
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:45,096
Where are you!?

55
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:08,321
It looks like we've made it in
safely among everyone else.

56
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,857
All of them look like the bookworm type...

57
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:13,830
I just can't get to like people like them!

58
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:17,057
But I'm sure they all have
dreams about their future...

59
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:19,331
...and are studying hard
to achieve them.

60
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:23,432
Studying to achieve
their dreams of their futures?

61
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:26,773
And then there's me...
I guess I'm a sloth...

62
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:30,372
It's too late for you to repent now!

63
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:34,350
Sheesh! Fine, I'm just
a clumsy slow USAGI!

64
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,560
Are you Ami Mizuno?

65
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:47,696
You always do well on
those national exams.

66
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:51,034
I was thinking I wanted
to meet you someday.

67
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:52,330
You are...?

68
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:57,504
Yui Bidoh. I was listed next to you
at the previous national exam--

69
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,067
Oh, she's the one that
got the perfect score!

70
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:01,703
And you are?

71
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,840
I don't have a name that's worth anything...

72
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:10,219
If you are one of Miss Mizuno's friends,
you must be very studious.

73
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:12,347
What are your best subjects?

74
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:15,587
Naps and lunch...

75
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:19,726
You're so witty!

76
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:22,688
Oh, Miss Mizuno,
this is the perfect opportunity.

77
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,099
I want to show you something
that might help with your studies.

78
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:27,468
Do come this way!

79
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:32,165
This is our valuable adolescence!
I can't just study all day!

80
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:36,305
Usagi, don't stand there resolved,
we have to investigate inside the building!

81
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:37,371
Then...

82
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:51,251
The waves are making a commotion,
and the ocean has started to be stormy.

83
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:52,887
Do you feel it, too, Michiru?

84
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,626
Yes. An ominous feeling...

85
00:05:56,534 --> 00:06:01,494
There's an eerie energy of an
unknown kind all over this school.

86
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:05,236
I've been thinking that for a while now.
I'll get to the bottom of it this time!

87
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:08,372
Then, we head down to THAT
room in the basement again?

88
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:13,244
I'll make sure to tear away
the veil of mystery from it.

89
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,117
This is...?

90
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,626
A greenhouse model of the universe.
I made it in the Science Club.

91
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:25,526
It's pretty, isn't it?

92
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:26,621
Yes...

93
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:29,631
This is the Tau Nebula.

94
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:32,126
Tau Nebula...?!

95
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,729
Our school is broken into five classes...

96
00:06:35,773 --> 00:06:41,143
Philosophy, entertainment, science,
physical, and professional.

97
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:45,846
Other than the instructors for
each class, superior students...

98
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:49,649
...like me become lecturers and
teach the students of Mugen Academy.

99
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:53,151
You, a student, teach a class?

100
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:57,760
Yes. Anyone can become a lecturer,
given that they are intelligent enough.

101
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:00,059
That's the good part of Mugen Academy.

102
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:01,086
But...

103
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:06,263
Even if you do well in academics,
it doesn't make you a great teacher.

104
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:10,036
Because to be a teacher,
you have to be one who understands...

105
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:13,407
...the feelings of students
with poor grades as well...

106
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:15,776
Or it wouldn't work, I think...

107
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,280
That's so idealistic.

108
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:20,750
Logic is what is most important in science.

109
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:23,049
You don't need to think about
other people's emotions.

110
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:25,322
I don't think that way.

111
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:29,053
I think that science especially
needs the warmth of human hearts...

112
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:29,923
Oh, my!

113
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,360
Miss Mizuno, you're at the top of
the country, yet that doesn't sound...

114
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:35,160
...like something someone who
gets such good grades would say!

115
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:38,298
The exam is about to begin.

116
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:41,429
I'll see you again,
kindhearted Miss Mizuno.

117
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:55,411
That student, Ami Mizuno...

118
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:58,522
There's something suspicious about her.

119
00:07:58,556 --> 00:08:00,387
There is a need to investigate...

120
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:04,087
Perhaps, she might be
one of the sailor soldiers.

121
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:07,125
Yui Bidoh, in charge of the science class...

122
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:10,691
Determination of the truth
about Ami Mizuno...

123
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:14,700
Leave it to me!

124
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:17,097
That's for me--!

125
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,477
This plan to gather many pure
hearts at once is all MY plan.

126
00:08:24,915 --> 00:08:29,943
If Ami Mizuno turns out to be a sailor soldier
and gets in the way, I'll get rid of her.

127
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,088
Byruit!

128
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:32,646
You stay quiet!

129
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:35,650
These nano-robots are efficient.

130
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:40,727
They are computers that faithfully follow
Just the data that gets inputted into them.

131
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:44,166
They move however I want
them to, at my command.

132
00:08:53,277 --> 00:08:56,178
If we let these take care of it,
success is guaranteed.

133
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:59,944
Yeah, do as you wish,
however you want to do it!

134
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:01,451
Right!

135
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:06,385
Why did you come back from the dead?

136
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:11,122
It isn't so that you can hang
all over the professor, right?

137
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:15,191
What's wrong, Kaorinite?

138
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:16,199
Oh, no, nothing...

139
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:24,271
It looks like everyone is
getting engrossed in the exam.

140
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:27,706
Now, nano-robots!

141
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:32,045
Suck up all the excited,
pure hearts of the students!

142
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,888
Right now, there isn't
anything suspicious going on.

143
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,725
Everyone is taking the exam so seriously...

144
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,891
Oh, this is...!?

145
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:52,027
The pure hearts are...!!

146
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:58,532
Sacrifice your pure hearts
for our Messiah of Silence!

147
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,600
So this place really is--!

148
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:03,545
The headquarters of the Death Busters!?

149
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:05,074
What should we do?

150
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:09,207
There has to be someone controlling
the computers somewhere around here.

151
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:10,880
I guess defeating whoever
that is is our only way.

152
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:12,855
Let's let everyone know.

153
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,221
Yeah!

154
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,137
An eerie feeling...

155
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:14,010
The Messiah of Silence...

156
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:16,781
The ultimate evil that should be obliterated...

157
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:18,677
Wait!

158
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:21,986
Ami?

159
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,857
Don't hurt that girl!

160
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:25,122
What!?

161
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:28,325
This is the root of all evil who will seal
away the entire world into one of silence!

162
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:30,230
I can't let her off the hook!

163
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:33,369
No, Hotaru is a pitiful girl.

164
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:36,237
She's a pitiful girl who just
got used by the Death Busters.

165
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:39,237
You're being idealistic.
Don't show sympathy to the enemy!

166
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:42,245
That will lead the entire
universe to destruction!

167
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:44,872
This girl has committed no crime.

168
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:45,779
Get out of the way!

169
00:11:45,816 --> 00:11:46,976
Don't get in our way!

170
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,978
No, don't lay a finger on her!

171
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:52,480
What are you doing?

172
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,481
I thought this place was off limits.

173
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:56,985
Michiru Kaioh.

174
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:57,925
Ami Mizuno.

175
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:59,327
Haruka Tenoh.

176
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:01,160
You guys are suspicious...

177
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:03,730
Show your real identities!

178
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,799
Yui Bidoh is...!?

179
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:10,935
MOSAIC BUSTER!

180
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:22,980
Haruka! Michiru!

181
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:24,613
Stop!!

182
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:26,551
Don't worry about us!

183
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:29,390
I can't leave you here like this!

184
00:12:31,462 --> 00:12:32,656
An idealist!

185
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:37,429
Such idealism to sacrifice yourself to
save your friends leads to your death!

186
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:38,867
Take this!

187
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,461
MOSAIC BUSTER!

188
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:50,240
MERCURY STAR POWER...

189
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,612
MAKE UP!

190
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,754
What!?

191
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:11,464
Soldier of Knowledge,
guarded by Mercury, the planet of water!

192
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:13,129
Sailor Mercury!

193
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,495
Genius girl Ami Mizuno...

194
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,440
So your true identity is
indeed a Sailor Soldier!!

195
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:20,272
Don't abuse science!

196
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:21,703
Shut up!

197
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:23,269
Die with these two!

198
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:26,779
MOSAIC BUSTER!

199
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:32,522
SHI NE AQUA...

200
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:33,784
...ILLUSION!

201
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,088
It's useless!

202
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:49,863
Does that hurt?

203
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:55,140
Invisible nano-machines that came from the
program that I control are biting into...

204
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:57,204
...your body and are
trying to break you up!

205
00:13:57,748 --> 00:14:03,015
The only thing left will be your
beautiful soul, your pure heart.

206
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:06,887
It's wrong to use science for evil...

207
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:08,721
You should be using them
for people's happiness...

208
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:12,651
You will sacrifice that pure heart
for the Messiah of Silence!

209
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:16,730
I can't let her give away her pure heart!

210
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:23,733
Sailor Soldiers!

211
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:27,233
I can't forgive you for sucking
up all the pure hearts of students...

212
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:31,236
...who are enthusiastic in their
studies just for your own purpose!

213
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:35,709
For love and justice,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

214
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:37,242
Sailor Moon!

215
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:42,523
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

216
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,991
All 5 of you are here!

217
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:46,120
Sailor Moon!

218
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:48,256
If you move,
Mercury's life will be over!

219
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,262
MOSAIC BUSTER!

220
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:56,700
Guys!

221
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:01,408
URANUS PLANET POWER...

222
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:03,777
MAKE UP!

223
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:08,077
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

224
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:10,450
MAKE UP!

225
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:36,075
What!?

226
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:41,313
WORLD...

227
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:43,581
...SHAKING!

228
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:53,861
DEEP...

229
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:55,421
...SUBMERGE!

230
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:09,245
CRISIS...

231
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,611
MAKE UP!

232
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:21,748
Super Sailor Moon!

233
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:25,759
The one doing all
the bad things is that ring!

234
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:49,550
RAINBOW...

235
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:50,883
...MOON...

236
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:53,822
...HEARTACHE!

237
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:06,360
My cute little nano-robots!!

238
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:09,702
Get rid of Super Sailor Moon!

239
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:16,940
W-What's going on!?

240
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,813
Nano-robots, you are
attacking the wrong target!

241
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,714
Idiots!

242
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:22,912
Don't you realize that it's me!?

243
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,852
Machines don't have hearts.

244
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,984
Science doesn't need hearts.

245
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:31,255
That's what you said.

246
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:03,492
Byruit has failed...

247
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:05,893
A foolish one...

248
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,895
Such arrogance.

249
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:10,729
It wasn't even worth my time
to directly do away with her...

250
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:15,101
Sailor Soldiers,
I have confirmed your identities...

251
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:28,009
Is this what she got
for believing only in...

252
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:30,315
...the mechanical aspect of science,
and not learning to love?

253
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:34,189
Poor girl...

254
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,894
The Messiah of Silence is...!!

255
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:45,799
Hotaru!

256
00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:00,775
Sailor Soldiers...

257
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:04,014
The battle has just begun!!

258
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,790
Hotaru!!

259
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,934
Mamo-chan... Plu...

260
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:28,641
You'll catch a cold.

261
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:29,804
Yeah...

262
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:31,746
How long are you going to stay here?

263
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:33,579
I don't care if it's just for a moment.

264
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:36,279
I want to see Hotaru.

265
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,447
Hotaru will come back all right... right?

266
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:41,652
Chibiusa...

267
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:43,454
Small Lady...

268
00:19:56,473 --> 00:19:59,909
Ami Mizuno... if you didn't
stop us back there...

269
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:02,207
...we could have defeated
the Messiah of Silence.

270
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:07,410
Your idealism has let
the Messiah of Silence escape.

271
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:11,345
But... that idealism is what saved us...

272
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:13,447
So, at least for today...

273
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,424
We have to thank you.

274
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:22,424
