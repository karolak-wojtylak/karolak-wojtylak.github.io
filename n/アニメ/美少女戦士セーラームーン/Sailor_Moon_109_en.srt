1
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:04,640
Well, it's true that
of the five of us...

2
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:08,280
...only Minako hasn't had
her pure heart hunted.

3
00:00:08,322 --> 00:00:12,224
But none of us are thinking that
Minako doesn't have a pure heart!

4
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,251
No, not at all!
So please calm down, Minako!

5
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:17,763
Sheesh, who said such a thing!?

6
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:20,528
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!!

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,989
Hello?

8
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:31,501
This is Eugeal.

9
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:33,697
Actually, I'm calling because
I noticed something strange...

10
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:34,966
Oh?

11
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:39,568
A human shadow appeared
amongst the data for the Grail.

12
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,202
Just as I thought...

13
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:44,305
That is the user of the Grail.

14
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:46,411
The user of the Grail...?

15
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:48,610
Yes.

16
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:52,214
If the Grail ends up in
hands that will aid us...

17
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:55,919
...the world of darkness that
we long for will be completed.

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,296
However, if someone who is against
our beliefs gets a hold of it...

19
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:07,567
...our objective will be crushed!

20
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:11,006
We must get a hold of it before
anyone else, no matter at what cost!

21
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:13,101
We must!!

22
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:17,911
Where is this... user of the Grail?

23
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:20,941
We must first get a hold of
the Grail... See you later.

24
00:01:20,985 --> 00:01:22,646
By the way, Professor...

25
00:01:22,687 --> 00:01:25,383
You broke the phone receiver
just now, didn't you?

26
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:30,019
I will have there pair costs
Deducted from your paycheck.

27
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:35,722
I want the Sailor Soldiers
to pay for it...

28
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:46,043
I'm done!

29
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:50,612
You did it! 23 minutes!
That's a new record!

30
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:55,675
These were really hard problems!
I'm so amazing!

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,618
You did it!

32
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:57,484
Congrats.

33
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:59,353
That was pretty well-done for Usagi.

34
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,051
Thanks!

35
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:02,525
It's all thanks to you guys!

36
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,993
Oh, wait.

37
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,754
The calculations are off right here.

38
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:10,255
So, the answer becomes... this.

39
00:02:12,136 --> 00:02:14,570
Why? WHY!?

40
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:19,167
Usagi, you are doing what you can...
There, there...

41
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,440
I don't wanna do this anymore!

42
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,174
Don't cry each and every time!

43
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:24,408
But...

44
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:27,940
Although I said it's a mistake...
See, it's a simple one.

45
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:30,180
You just have to be careful next time.

46
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:32,985
I know I'm going to make a mistake
somewhere else next time!

47
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:36,858
I'm sick of all of this!
I don't want to go through such pain!!

48
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:39,687
So what about this much pain!?

49
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,598
Have you forgotten about when a Daimohn
took out your pure heart crystal!?

50
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:44,698
That's right.

51
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:48,432
Compared to the pain we felt back then,
studying can even be thought of as fun!

52
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:50,434
Let's do our best, Usagi!

53
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:52,538
All right... I understand...

54
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:54,875
It really was painful
back when it happened.

55
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:55,571
Yeah...

56
00:02:55,613 --> 00:02:58,548
It felt as painful as when I chugged
down a 1.5-liter bottled soft drink!

57
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,948
That was it!?

58
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:04,011
Oh, maybe the pain was that
plus about 10 balls of rice!

59
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:04,987
Yeah!

60
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:07,354
I see...

61
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,653
Something wrong?

62
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:16,428
Hey, Artemis...

63
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:21,334
Why do you think Daimohn
don't come after me!?

64
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:27,610
Everyone other than me had the crystals
of their pure hearts sought after...

65
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,203
Maybe you're not pure...?

66
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:32,012
Oh, no, that can't possibly be it!

67
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,710
It can't, right?

68
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,984
Maybe because I quit playing
volleyball that I loved so much...

69
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:40,217
I'm not as focused on one thing...?

70
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,224
Are you worried about it?

71
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:47,690
Not really...

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,298
Usagi!

73
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:27,428
I'm sorry, did I hit you?

74
00:04:27,471 --> 00:04:29,029
Are you all right?

75
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:31,473
I'm okay, I'm all right!

76
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:34,637
But enough of that.
Are YOU all right, Minako?

77
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:36,640
About what?

78
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:39,142
You know...

79
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:43,518
You mean how I'm the only one
that Daimohn hasn't come after?

80
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:46,648
Of course I'm not worried about that!

81
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,652
Geez!

82
00:04:53,497 --> 00:04:54,589
Anyway you look at it...

83
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:57,726
...I'm not convinced that I'm the
only one without a pure heart!

84
00:04:57,768 --> 00:04:59,167
Of course not!

85
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:05,773
This time, for sure...

86
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,835
Hey, are you REALLY
not worried about it?

87
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:09,436
Of course not!

88
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:13,180
Maybe you are thinking
too much, Artemis.

89
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:17,017
That's right! Minako wouldn't be
worried about something like that...

90
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:20,251
So what part of me isn't pure!?

91
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,019
Sheesh!

92
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:25,654
If they don't realize how pure I am,
the enemy really isn't that formidable.

93
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:27,755
Hello?

94
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,161
Minako...

95
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:34,934
You can't possibly be considering
getting yourself targeted, right, Minako?

96
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:39,674
You can't!
You absolutely can't do that!

97
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,177
It's better if you don't.

98
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:44,875
What would happen if they took
out your pure heart crystal!?

99
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:47,076
If that happens,
I'll get it back myself.

100
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:50,918
That's impossible!
You just CAN'T do that! Please!!

101
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:53,890
I was just kidding...
Now let me... go!

102
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,220
- You're kidding.
- You're kidding.

103
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:01,796
Hey, Minako.

104
00:06:01,832 --> 00:06:05,097
You know, Usagi has
a pure love for Mamoru...

105
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:07,764
But she has a pure love for
eating and sleeping as well.

106
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:12,333
And she has a pure hatred for studying,
so she purely wants to ditch studying.

107
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:15,209
But if you're saying that
THAT is a pure heart...

108
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:17,771
...then you have to realize
that she's just an idiot.

109
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:19,077
Thanks a lot...

110
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:23,183
Even the enemy can't see through
to your true purity, Minako.

111
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,678
As I said, I'm not
worried about it! Sheesh!

112
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:30,324
Usagi...

113
00:06:30,361 --> 00:06:31,157
Yeah?

114
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:32,685
I have a favor to ask you.

115
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,960
What?

116
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:41,371
Can you take half of these?

117
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:46,001
I kinda don't want to...

118
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,921
Let's leave her alone for a while...

119
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:09,661
You're right. Considering how Minako is,
she won't do anything too irrational.

120
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,895
You think so...?

121
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:14,364
A pure heart is...

122
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,430
A heart that deeply focuses
in on one thing at a time...

123
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:19,170
That's true, Usagi is
one who concentrates on...

124
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,906
...one thing at a time,
so much to be considered foolish.

125
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:25,609
Compared to that, I think about
so many aspects of things...

126
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,173
Maybe I'm more mature in that sense?

127
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:28,742
Hey.

128
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:30,749
Oh, hello.

129
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,891
Haruka, Michiru...

130
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,761
What do you think a pure heart is?

131
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:42,632
What are you talking about?

132
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,260
Can it be that she
knows about the talisman...!?

133
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:46,030
T-

134
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,559
T-!?

135
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:47,662
T-!!?

136
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:51,675
T-aking for instance,
is there something that...

137
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,701
...someone with a pure heart
is likely to be doing?

138
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:56,179
T-

139
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:56,611
T-?

140
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,946
T-ry doing something that
is for the good of others.

141
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:02,445
Doing something for
the good of others!?

142
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:05,455
Please help us with
the Blood Donation of Love.

143
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:07,980
We currently are short
on blood for transfusion.

144
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:10,892
- For instance, donating your blood...
- Thank you very much!

145
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:15,562
I guess we read too much into that.

146
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,931
Perhaps we are starting to be rushed...

147
00:08:19,203 --> 00:08:23,401
But, she took us seriously, although
I said that off the top of my head...

148
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,874
A dangerous purity.

149
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,208
Um...

150
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:30,373
Take these!

151
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:32,211
They're tokens of my thanks.

152
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:37,245
I don't want this...

153
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:42,484
Donate blood! Donate blood!
Donate blood! Donate blood!

154
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:43,515
Please go ahead!

155
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:46,052
Don't be bashful, you can
take as much as you want!

156
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:49,065
It's for the good of others,
for the good of the world!

157
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:50,491
Eugeal...

158
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:52,695
Have you found a new target?

159
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:53,634
Yes.

160
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:57,198
The owner of a pure heart type
that I can't yet figure out...

161
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:01,234
However, I feel that the Sailor Soldiers
will once again get in our way.

162
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,780
Well then, I shall prevent their...

163
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,248
...intrusion!

164
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:11,482
I will make a Daimohn to do just that!

165
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:20,120
I'm Minako Aino, and
I'm here to donate blood!

166
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:22,291
I may look young, but I'm 18!

167
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,733
So, you can go ahead and
take as much as you want!

168
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:29,595
I'm doing something for
the good of others...

169
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,971
I'm so pure...

170
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:32,737
I'm TOO pure...!

171
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:59,433
Yeah, and every day she lies about her age,
going from one donation area to the next!

172
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,233
I'm surprised she's
able to keep it up...

173
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:05,435
Well, just stay by her side
in case an enemy attacks her.

174
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:08,104
And make sure she's
getting proper nutrition.

175
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:10,204
Yeah, you're right...

176
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:12,640
Donate blood! Donate blood!
Donate blood! Donate blood!

177
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:14,617
I still think we should stop her...

178
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:19,214
If Minako's heart crystal turns out to
be a talisman, it would be too dangerous.

179
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:20,419
But...

180
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:23,017
If that's the case,
she'll be targeted sooner or later...

181
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,152
That's true...

182
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:28,494
So, in the end, we have to
save her when that happens.

183
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:31,000
But, thinking about this...

184
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:34,994
Is Minako, who's running around donation
areas for her own pure heart, really pure?

185
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:37,036
T-That's...

186
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:38,632
Minako!

187
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:41,406
I got you Morimorin-C and Vitavitan-A!

188
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:42,742
Drink these, and do your best!

189
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,145
Thanks!

190
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:49,682
That hits the spot!

191
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,950
She's p-pure! Minako is pure too!

192
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:54,389
- Pure, pure, pure. So pure.
- Yeah, pure! She is pure.

193
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,890
Well, off to the next spot!

194
00:11:07,604 --> 00:11:08,332
Captured!

195
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:20,672
Minako!

196
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:33,159
A pure heart...

197
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:34,129
It came out!

198
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:35,927
I'm glad for you, Minako...

199
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:38,127
Now, hurry up and put it back inside...

200
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:40,765
Impossible!

201
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:45,201
Minako! Wait!

202
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:46,801
Eugeal!?

203
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:48,539
- What does this mean!?
- Guys, hurry!

204
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:51,446
Artemis! There are
bottles at your feet!

205
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:55,077
- Artemis!
- I'm sorry...

206
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,505
W-What horribly strong mental powers...

207
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:20,001
Wait!

208
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,004
Don't come any closer to that girl!

209
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:23,842
What!?

210
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:25,178
How arrogant!

211
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,911
Come out, Daimohn!!

212
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:31,914
Doorknobder!

213
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:37,916
When going out, one word to
your neighbor, and lock the door!

214
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:39,786
Go lock up.

215
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,422
I will go lock up!

216
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:52,867
Completed!

217
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,172
Who is it?

218
00:12:55,746 --> 00:12:57,179
Haruka, and Michiru too...?

219
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:00,950
If you didn't stick your nose into other
people's business, you'd live longer.

220
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:02,382
What should I do?

221
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,887
If I transformed here...

222
00:13:04,922 --> 00:13:05,684
But...

223
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:10,686
We can't possibly transform here...

224
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:17,063
Hold it right there!

225
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:27,599
MOON COSMIC POWER...

226
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:30,044
MAKE UP!

227
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:01,336
What!?

228
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:02,606
So it WAS her!

229
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,281
Wanting to cherish a pure heart...

230
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:09,683
To come after the innocence of such
a maiden is something I can't forgive!

231
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:12,350
For love and justice...

232
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,516
...the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

233
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:20,521
Sailor Moon!

234
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:25,765
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

235
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:29,069
Doorknobder, kill her!

236
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:30,869
- Huh?
- Don't give me "Huh?"!

237
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:33,934
I'm for locking up,
and not really good at combat...

238
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:35,535
- DO IT!
- Sure.

239
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,210
DOORKNOB RELUCTANCE ATTACK!

240
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:42,074
See, you can do it if you try. Now...

241
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,780
You can't!

242
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:56,562
I can't give you that.

243
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:00,034
Doorknobder, get rid of them first!

244
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,298
RELUCTANCE ATTACK...!

245
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,708
We have no choice.

246
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:07,300
I agree.

247
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:10,670
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

248
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:13,114
MAKE UP!

249
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:16,582
URANUS PLANET POWER...

250
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,020
MAKE UP!

251
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:45,306
Haruka... and Michiru were...

252
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:47,807
Three Sailor Soldiers...!?

253
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:53,278
WORLD...

254
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:55,314
...SHAKING!

255
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,261
Most unfortunate.

256
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:03,823
Wait, stop that, Michiru!

257
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:06,965
Please!

258
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:08,835
Please return that crystal!

259
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:11,306
This isn't a talisman.

260
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,108
What!?

261
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:17,045
BURNING MANDALA!

262
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,846
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

263
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:27,013
SHINE AQUA ILLUSION!

264
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:31,020
There are Sailor Soldiers
outside as well!?

265
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:32,289
Doorknobder!

266
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:33,660
Get every last one of them!!

267
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:36,659
DOORKNOB DESPARATION ATTACK!

268
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:42,897
DEEP...

269
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:44,236
...SUBMERGE!

270
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:52,513
I told you, I'm not good at combat!!

271
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:54,608
Now, Sailor Moon.

272
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:55,709
Yeah.

273
00:16:59,623 --> 00:17:02,217
Y-You should get rid of HER first!

274
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:22,979
Out of my way!

275
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:27,181
MOON SPIRAL...

276
00:17:27,984 --> 00:17:30,544
WITCHES EUGEAL...

277
00:17:30,587 --> 00:17:32,077
HEA...

278
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:34,420
FI...

279
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,052
...RT ATTACK!

280
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:40,892
...RE BUSTER!!

281
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,341
LOVELY!

282
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:10,883
Don't move!

283
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:15,488
Even Sailor Moon's ultimate attack
was no match for this Fire Buster...

284
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:18,695
...which is currently being
registered as a practical model!

285
00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:21,101
Now, all of you get
together into one bunch.

286
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:25,507
Otherwise, I'll make a roast
out of that girl lying right there.

287
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:31,670
I'll send all of you to
the afterlife in one group!

288
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:36,778
What!?

289
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:39,979
VENUS STAR POWER...

290
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:42,423
MAKE UP!

291
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:05,545
T-They're ALL Sailor Soldiers!?

292
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:11,985
VENUS...

293
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:13,182
...LOVE ME...

294
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:15,020
...CHAIN!

295
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:18,920
Dammit!

296
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:21,294
Just you wait and see!

297
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:23,265
I saw who you REALLY are!!

298
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:27,233
Backing up!

299
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,539
Wait!

300
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,171
Haruka... Michiru...

301
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:40,749
Please, tell me.

302
00:19:40,784 --> 00:19:43,048
What is your real objective?

303
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:48,047
Why do you try to get the talismans,
even if it means sacrificing human lives?

304
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,755
Don't probe where you don't have to.

305
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:52,955
It's better if you don't
get too deeply involved.

306
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:54,020
But...

307
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:56,294
Enough!

308
00:19:57,467 --> 00:20:02,461
Haruka and Michiru are
Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune...!?

309
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:05,536
Does that mean that
they really are enemies...?

310
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:07,702
I don't want to believe that...

311
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:15,218
They found out who we are.

312
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:19,086
We might have been foolish
to transform back there...

313
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:21,317
I don't regret it.

314
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:22,620
That so?

315
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:26,755
If we hadn't,
we wouldn't have survived...

316
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:30,664
And I wanted to save those girls.

317
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:37,664
