1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,460
Come on, Chibiusa!

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:06,767
If you're going to be coming
by again, tell me in advance!

3
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:10,866
Even without you,
we're REALLY busy because...

4
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:13,377
...we have new enemies and
mysterious soldiers!

5
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:16,939
I'm fine with having Sailor Chibi Moon
around, but if you trouble the others...

6
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:19,815
...I'll punish you in
the name of the moon!

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,234
I, Chibiusa, also known
as Small Lady, have...

8
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:28,071
...returned to the 20th
century for some training.

9
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:31,976
I hope you guys will be nice to me!

10
00:00:42,156 --> 00:00:45,751
Returning here...
Who decided on that?

11
00:00:45,793 --> 00:00:48,762
Oh, that's right...
I have a letter from Mom.

12
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:50,730
A letter? Let me see...

13
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:52,530
Can you read it for me, Minako?

14
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, sure.

15
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:57,834
- Wait a minute!
- Okay, I'll read it.

16
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:01,307
"It seems that you are able
to train our Small Lady."

17
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:03,866
"Oh, my, how can I thank you!"

18
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:07,847
"Thanks, and I trust
you with my daughter."

19
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:09,508
...so it says.

20
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:11,616
What, that's it!?

21
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:16,055
Neo Queen Serenity really
is Usagi in a way...

22
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:16,953
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,821
What do you mean by that...?

24
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,090
I know what you mean, Luna.
Because this letter...

25
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:25,155
...has no kanji in it!

26
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:26,798
Oh, my god, you're right!

27
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:27,425
See?

28
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,628
There are traces of where she erased
kanji that she made mistakes on...

29
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,796
Why doesn't she check
with a dictionary?

30
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:33,033
I'm sure because that's too tedious.

31
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:36,304
It really IS Usagi in that way...

32
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:40,780
Um... If we have time for that, we
should worry about Chibiusa now, right?

33
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:43,978
But training? What in the
world will she be doing?

34
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:46,315
If she's getting training
to be a real princess...

35
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:48,617
...she doesn't really have
to come over to this era.

36
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:51,718
I just hope Usagi's clumsiness
doesn't rub off onto her...

37
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:53,521
Really... That's what
I'm worried about...

38
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,959
Mars from the future said that too!

39
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:58,761
She also told me many stories
about Usagi's stupidity.

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,529
REI! What did you tell Chibiusa!?

41
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:02,398
I don't know.

42
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:04,597
The one that talked to her
was Mars-from-the-future.

43
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:07,300
S-S-Same difference!
You were badmouthing about me!

44
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:10,902
Don't worry. I'm not going to be
clumsy and make mistakes like Usagi.

45
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:14,542
We'll help out in whatever way
we can, so feel free to ask us.

46
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:15,673
Thanks.

47
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:18,310
Well, I'm going to go train now!

48
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:24,748
There's something else in here.

49
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,919
"P.S. Usagi in the 20th century--"

50
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:32,094
"Studying while young
really was important."

51
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:36,159
"Make sure you do it well," she wrote.

52
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:38,600
She really IS Usagi after all...

53
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,665
I don't want to study!!

54
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:45,166
The 20th century is a great place
after all... I can relax so much here!

55
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:50,880
Small Lady, you have to learn
something in the 20th century.

56
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:53,318
That is how to make friends.

57
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:54,650
Friends?

58
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:55,985
Yes.

59
00:02:56,023 --> 00:03:01,689
These valuable encounters
will help mature you.

60
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,761
Wait!

61
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,201
Hurry, hurry!

62
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:12,598
ValuabIe encounters, huh...?

63
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:28,979
Valuable encounters...

64
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:32,387
H-Hey... This...

65
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:35,020
Did you drop this?

66
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:37,997
Yeah, that's mine.

67
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:40,499
Got a problem with that?

68
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:46,496
Hey, girl, which do you prefer,
bell peppers or shallots?

69
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,899
How about some coffee--
oh, wait, since I put milk in it...

70
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:55,074
...coffee-flavored milk--
with me at dawn?

71
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:00,286
Are you all right?
Hold yourself together!

72
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,651
The wound is deep!

73
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,315
Don't give up!

74
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:05,655
This calls for the last resort...

75
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:07,387
Look at this!

76
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,324
My little elephant!

77
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,532
You idiot!

78
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:18,936
Ouch!

79
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:22,499
Is it punishment in
the name of the moon?

80
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,203
I'll punish you when we get back home!

81
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:25,541
Y-You monster!

82
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:28,047
Who's the monster!?

83
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:31,111
Even though she said
"a Iot of friends"...

84
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,585
I do want to choose them,
at the least.

85
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:54,405
I'm sure he was over here...

86
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,204
Hey, Chibiusa.

87
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:58,941
Mamo-chan!

88
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,977
It's Mamo-chan! It's Mamo-chan!!

89
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:03,312
Come on now...

90
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,046
You know, I came here for training.

91
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:06,916
Training?

92
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:11,083
Yeah. Mom and Dad in the
future said that I should, too.

93
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:12,853
Come on!

94
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:14,451
Chibiusa!

95
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,962
Mamo-chan is on a date
with me right now!

96
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:19,759
He's MY Mamo-chan!

97
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,529
No, you can't!

98
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:23,593
- Get away from him!
- I don't want to!

99
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:25,901
Hey, how about we all eat
takoyaki together, and not fight...?

100
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:33,408
Here, I'll feed you some, Mamo-chan.

101
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,812
No, that's what I do!

102
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,406
No, ME!

103
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:40,419
Oh, and here I thought
it was some happy family.

104
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:45,290
The last time I saw you was
at the festival, right, kiddo?

105
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:46,349
Haruka.

106
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,452
Michiru.

107
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:50,654
They're so pretty...

108
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,631
They're just like Mom and Dad.

109
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:57,126
Chibiusa, Haruka looks like
that, but she's a woman.

110
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,435
And your mom from
the future is me, right?

111
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,975
That just HAS to be a mistake!

112
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,876
Mamo-chan I can understand, but I've
been thinking all along that you...

113
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:07,709
You know...

114
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:10,045
What!?

115
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:14,686
Will you two cut it out already?

116
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:15,449
Okay...

117
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,686
We're going to have some tea now.
Would you like to join us?

118
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:23,992
- Oh, no, I'll pass for today--
- Oh, tea? Sounds wonderful.

119
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,260
I wanted to have some right about now.

120
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:29,791
And cake with lots of
whipped cream, and cookies...

121
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:35,103
Oh, pudding a la mode is also something
that I wanted to have right now... huh?

122
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:40,202
By tea, you meant...

123
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:47,711
You're...

124
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:53,659
He's Tamasaburo, the master of the famous
Japanese tea style "Yaburakoji Burakoji."

125
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,093
Welcome.

126
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,169
It's destiny.

127
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,473
Tea is great...

128
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:20,645
Your heart finds peace.

129
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:33,394
It's too HOT, you idiot!

130
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,630
I think I've had enough for today.

131
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,900
Oh, I have an idea!

132
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:40,496
Yes...?

133
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,905
Japanese tea ceremonies?

134
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,111
I have found one.

135
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:53,780
Very well. Then, I shall now prepare
a Daimohn most fit for that purpose.

136
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:15,097
CHA-GA-MA!

137
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:56,541
Ch-Chibiusa, my feet fell asleep!
Let's go home!

138
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,950
I'm going to sit through this!
I'm different from you, Usagi!

139
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:03,453
I see that the little one
is doing a better job.

140
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,449
Wow, odango!

141
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:07,687
Thanks, I'll have some!

142
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:52,497
If it's too strenuous for you, feel
free to sit in a more relaxed manner.

143
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:55,002
No, I'm all right.

144
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:59,000
I shall show you something nice, then.

145
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:05,582
Master...

146
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:08,579
How considerate of others...

147
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,948
The master is doing all
of this on purpose...

148
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:16,120
...to relieve the tension of the
tea ceremony for you little ones.

149
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:17,322
That bowl...

150
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:19,958
Its rarity is at the level of a national
treasure, and if you were to buy it...

151
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:22,092
...it would be over 10 million yen.

152
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:25,593
O-Over 10 MILLION yen!?

153
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:27,598
Oh, I'm all right.

154
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,108
Please, s-s-s-stop! Something
that costs s-s-several million...

155
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:32,369
My feet...

156
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:33,606
...are asleep...

157
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:45,820
You're a little heavy...

158
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:47,117
Sorry...

159
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,821
I just...

160
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,709
I hate this!

161
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:13,912
You embarrassed me
in front of Tamasaburo!

162
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:16,444
I HATE you, Usagi!

163
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:20,323
I was embarrassed too...
in front of Haruka and Michiru.

164
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:22,322
You got what you deserved.

165
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,630
What was that!?

166
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,633
Usako!

167
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:33,371
Are you getting fond
of Tamasaburo, Chibiusa?

168
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:38,332
Um... Mom told me...

169
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:42,845
She told me to make a lot of
friends in the 20th century...

170
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:46,540
That it will create
valuable encounters...

171
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,110
I see.

172
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:52,181
You didn't have that many people to
play with in the future world, did you?

173
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:55,854
So that was it? If you had told me so
earlier, I would have encouraged you.

174
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:59,830
If you encouraged me, Usagi,
things would be in a bigger mess!

175
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:00,764
Wha--!

176
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,931
Well, at least we now know what's
going on. Both of you, make up.

177
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:25,917
I... I'm going to make sure
I can be his apprentice!

178
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,824
Don't get the kimono dirty.

179
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:30,159
You're so cheap... it's not like
you're going to be wearing this again.

180
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:33,029
- You don't have to call me cheap!
- Cheap, cheap, REALLY cheap!

181
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:37,059
If you're going to call me that,
give me my kimono back!

182
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:39,697
That was...

183
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,001
Eugeal!

184
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:48,003
She went into Tamasaburo's house!

185
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:53,711
Luna!

186
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:56,119
What are you doing!?

187
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,988
I seem to be stuck here,
and can't do anything...

188
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:01,755
Maybe you should go on a diet then...

189
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:05,457
At least you can help
me out a little bit!

190
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,847
Oh, did I hit something?

191
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,315
May I ask who you are?

192
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,179
Captured!

193
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:31,149
Tamasaburo!

194
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:35,190
MOON PRISM POWER, MAKE UP!

195
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,239
Such a piece of cake.

196
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:50,401
You can't!

197
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:55,745
I won't let you take
Tamasaburo's heart away!

198
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:58,910
For love and justice, an apprentice to
a pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

199
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:02,353
- Appear before me, Daimohn!
- Sailor Chibi Moon!

200
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:08,185
In the name of the
moon from the future...

201
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:09,819
...I'll punish you!

202
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:10,624
Eh?

203
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:13,427
In the name of the
moon from the future...

204
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,491
...I'LL PUNISH YOU!

205
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:19,331
Chagarma!

206
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,738
Someone is getting in my way!
Get rid of her!

207
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,779
Now, hand over that pure heart...

208
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:39,121
WORLD...

209
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:41,285
...SHAKING!

210
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,961
DEEP...

211
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,265
...SUBMERGE!

212
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:57,767
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Uranus...

213
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,210
...acts with elegance!

214
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:04,211
Also guided by a new era,
Sailor Neptune...

215
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,411
...acts with grace!

216
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:09,921
So you appear in front of me again!

217
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,014
Thank you...

218
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:13,958
We weren't trying to save you.

219
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:15,255
Tough luck.

220
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,125
This isn't a talisman.

221
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:19,297
A failure.

222
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,462
Chagarma! You can do whatever now.

223
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:26,666
If it ends up THAT way,
you can do THAT, so do THAT!

224
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:29,272
Selfish woman!

225
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:31,799
In that case... I'll get every
single person that gets in my way!

226
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:35,106
Where are the others!?

227
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:38,108
W-What? They're gone!?

228
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:46,623
PINK SUGAR...

229
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:50,789
...HEART ATTACK!

230
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:12,316
Delicious.

231
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:15,310
Ouch! OUCH! Hey, you, stop that!

232
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,284
Oh, Chibi Moon is fighting by herself!

233
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:20,519
Usagi, hurry up and transform!

234
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,118
I know that!

235
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:27,764
MOON COSMIC POWER...

236
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,268
...MAKE UP!

237
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:03,361
Chibi Moon, leave the rest to me!

238
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,303
Sorry to keep you waiting!

239
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,704
The original, the true, the master!

240
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,173
For love and justice...

241
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,369
A pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

242
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:17,374
Sailor Moon!

243
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:22,616
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

244
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:24,646
You're LATE!

245
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,782
What?

246
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:28,123
You're the one who ran ahead!

247
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:32,122
Sailor Klutz Moon!

248
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,033
Now, I will entertain the guests!

249
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,329
Here you go!

250
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:37,802
And have the next one!

251
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:39,134
And another!

252
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,637
Ouch...

253
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:45,805
Look out!

254
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:48,279
Here! Here! Here!

255
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:51,845
Entertainment!

256
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:54,284
Ouch! OW! Ouch...

257
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:57,854
Those who do not understand
the soul of an entertainer...

258
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,051
This is the last event for you!

259
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,024
Cherishing the fleeting encounter,
and entertaining guests...

260
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,694
...with a warm heart is the
true meaning of the tea ceremony!

261
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:12,966
I will not allow you to stomp
upon such a warm heart!

262
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,469
Tuxedo Mask!

263
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:21,475
It seems that the time has come
for me to truly entertain someone...

264
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:29,979
You shall be surprised at
how I truly entertain.

265
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:32,488
Now, Sailor Moon!

266
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:34,990
Okay!

267
00:18:55,248 --> 00:18:59,048
MOON SPIRAL...

268
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:02,418
...HEART...

269
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,946
...ATTACK!

270
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:11,021
Oh, ur, I'm not ready yet...

271
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:13,989
I said...

272
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:17,366
LOVELY!

273
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:31,882
This is the way it
should be, Sailor Moon.

274
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,485
Sailor Moon...

275
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,385
You know...

276
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:38,886
What?

277
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:40,591
You know...

278
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:42,958
Thanks.

279
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:47,560
The little one sure puts up a fight.

280
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:52,333
So... awesome...

281
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:58,341
I'm going to make sure I can
be his apprentice THIS time!

282
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:02,337
Oh?

283
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:05,309
Haruka and Michiru...

284
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,842
They seem like they
came back in a hurry...

285
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:10,348
Sorry to keep you waiting!

286
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:14,957
In the awe I felt from the
soldiers in my dream...

287
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:17,861
...I found a new path for
Japanese tea ceremonies.

288
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:22,197
For courtesy and manners,
the handsome master in a sailor suit!

289
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:23,826
Sailor Tamasaburo!

290
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:26,099
YEAH!

291
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:30,105
L-Let's head back...

292
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:37,105
