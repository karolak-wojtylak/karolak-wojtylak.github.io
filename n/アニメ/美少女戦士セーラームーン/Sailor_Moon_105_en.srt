1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,695
Mako-chan is training in
a temple up in the mountains.

2
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:05,532
What's wrong?

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,060
Are you worried about something?

4
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:11,007
Mako-chan, your worries
make all of us worry, too!

5
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:19,716
Don't forget, all of us
are right behind you!

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,831
Why... Why did I lose
to someone like that..!?

7
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,270
IRONDER!

8
00:00:53,043 --> 00:00:54,840
It's my turn if you want power!

9
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:00,877
Dammit!

10
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:03,443
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

11
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:09,251
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

12
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:12,459
LOVELY!

13
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,205
I need to find a way to
power myself up even more!

14
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:39,719
I would like to speak with Eugeal.

15
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:44,618
Eugeal here. I have already
selected the next target.

16
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:46,823
Nothing less from you, Eugeal.

17
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:49,230
And, the next target is?

18
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:53,470
A Nichiren school monk by
the name of Kakusui Yakushiji.

19
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,699
He's been training in the
mountains, for 4 years...

20
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,003
...and 4 months now, to find
the true meaning of life.

21
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:02,004
He is the owner of a heart with a
purity rarely seen in people as of late.

22
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:06,911
By the way, Professor...
What shapes do the talismans come in?

23
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:10,648
If the pure hearts
are the real talismans...

24
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:13,213
They should transform into the shape
of the three divine objects...

25
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:19,162
In other words, a mirror,
a sword, and an orb.

26
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:21,721
And when the three divine
objects gather in one place...

27
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:25,565
...the holy grail is sure to appear.

28
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:43,042
DARUMAH!

29
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,672
Oh?

30
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,905
This postcard is from Mako-chan...

31
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:12,939
Mako-chan is currently
training at a temple...

32
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:13,915
Training?

33
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:16,078
OH!

34
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,420
The temple that Mako-chan is in is right
near the hotel where Mamo-chan is at!

35
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:24,423
Mamo-chan is working part-time
at a resort hotel right now.

36
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,427
This makes me a lucky girl!

37
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:29,125
Y-You can't be...

38
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:41,469
I'm so thrilled!

39
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,743
This is why I can't stop traveling!

40
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:48,775
Come on now... You should calm
down a little more when you eat.

41
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,684
You have pieces of your
lunch stuck on your cheek!

42
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,681
Usagi, I'm hungry.

43
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:56,693
Mina, can you give us some, too?

44
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:58,185
Oh, sure.

45
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,169
Hey, Usagi.

46
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,798
I'm surprised that
Chibiusa didn't tag along.

47
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,365
I showed her that I was worthy
of being her future mom...

48
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,003
...and she was satisfied
with my explanation.

49
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,842
She told me she was
going to the bathroom!

50
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,008
Then she went out the back door,
leaving me here!!

51
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:21,784
OOH! I'm not going to forgive her!

52
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:26,289
W-Why does it end up this way...?

53
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:39,028
According to the guidebook, there is
supposed to be a great hotel around here.

54
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:42,030
Oh! There it is!

55
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,106
It's wonderful!

56
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:47,042
Hey, why don't we sleep
over in that hotel?

57
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:51,337
But we're here to help
Mako-chan with her training.

58
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:53,942
It doesn't matter where we sleep.

59
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:57,920
I mean, we're fine as long
as we can help Mako-chan out...

60
00:04:57,955 --> 00:05:00,082
Oh, you're saying pretty
decent things today, Usagi.

61
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:03,457
I don't care where we go,
as long as we can study.

62
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:05,257
Then, let's change our plans!

63
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:07,058
STOP!

64
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:10,700
Everyone, don't fall for
Usagi's little conspiracy!

65
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,599
What is Usagi's conspiracy?

66
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:14,194
I-It's nothing...

67
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:18,032
Mamoru is working in that hotel!

68
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:21,772
Then, how you said you wanted
to help Mako-chan's training...

69
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:23,939
...and how you wanted to study...

70
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,380
...were all lies!

71
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,043
I-I wasn't lying!

72
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:29,245
Come on, it's a TRIP after all...

73
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:32,187
...wouldn't it be more fun if
there were many objectives?

74
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:33,348
Right? Right??

75
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,554
Let's go to the temple,
like we originally planned!

76
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:49,468
How many steps are there?

77
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:52,737
Compared to the Hikawa Shrine
it's about 52 times as long.

78
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:54,607
This is killing me...

79
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:06,318
Mako-chan!

80
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:10,421
What are all of you doing here?

81
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:14,625
We're here to help
your training, of course!

82
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:17,559
That wasn't nice of you to
come here without telling us!

83
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:20,627
We'll help you in any way we can!

84
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:30,504
Isn't he amazing?

85
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:34,580
He does 50 laps around
these mountains every day!

86
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,951
You fell in love with that
monk, didn't you, Mako-chan...

87
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:45,452
T-That's not it!
Now, back to training!

88
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:00,841
Even though it's summer,
the river water is cold!

89
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:05,443
Please, let me join you.

90
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,079
I-I can't...

91
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:15,853
How can I be like you, Mr. Kakusui?

92
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:19,119
I'm in a slump right now...

93
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:24,362
I can't give you the details, but my
attacks are no good against the enemy.

94
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:31,168
If I could achieve a
mental state like yours...

95
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,870
...Mr. Kakusui, I think I
could get out of this slump!

96
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,872
Why won't you speak to me!?

97
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,887
I-It's so cold...
that my mouth doesn't move...

98
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:50,382
I might have caught a cold...

99
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,394
That smile suits you well.

100
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,399
"There is no path that lets me live
my life other than this path."

101
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:00,130
"Therefore, I walk this path."

102
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,263
That is my favorite quote...

103
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:04,900
"There is no path that lets me live
my life other than this path."

104
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,739
"Therefore, I walk this path..."

105
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:12,113
However, despite this being the path I
chose, whenever my training doesn't...

106
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:15,983
...go quite as well as I want, I keep
wondering if this was the right path...

107
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,919
Even you wonder about
that, Mr. Kakusui?

108
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:24,583
I won't lose against anyone in
terms of wondering about my life.

109
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:30,030
Found the target!

110
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:36,130
Hey, Mako-chan.

111
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:39,404
Why did you come up with this
idea of training so suddenly?

112
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:41,707
I-I really don't have
a particular reason.

113
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:43,576
Is that really so?

114
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:46,481
If you're worried about
something, tell us.

115
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:49,479
It's better if you don't keep
your worries piled up inside you.

116
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,512
Though, there IS a problem if you don't
have anything inside you, like Usagi...

117
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:55,957
What do you mean by that, Rei!?

118
00:08:57,628 --> 00:09:00,324
How dare you!?
Take that! And that!

119
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:06,731
I have nothing to do with it!!

120
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:35,393
You guys came all the
way out here just for me...

121
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:40,529
But this problem is something
I want to solve on my own...

122
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,058
It's noisy...

123
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:09,622
What is it...?

124
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,933
Mako-chan...

125
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:23,913
It looks like we'll be better off
not helping her after all...

126
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:26,677
Seems that way!

127
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:30,113
W-What is this!?

128
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:36,622
Oh, no... I can't get
any energy from this!

129
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,591
But this gets your
brain working better.

130
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,724
And eating this food definitely
will make you lose weight!

131
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,235
Usagi, this is the perfect
opportunity for you!

132
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:47,361
I don't care if I get fat.

133
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:52,137
At least when I'm traveling,
I want to eat something yummy...

134
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:54,844
It looks like Mako-chan already left.

135
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:56,641
Makoto sure is working hard...

136
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,813
All right! Let's go to that
hotel for breakfast today!

137
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:07,653
Don't you think about
anything other than food!?

138
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,154
Y-You don't have to be
so harsh when you ask...

139
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:14,157
All right, fine,
we'll go to the hotel.

140
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,358
What are we going
to do with this meal?

141
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:20,836
I feel bad, since they
prepared it for us.

142
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:23,396
Of course, I'm going to eat it!

143
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:26,838
Speaking of the hotel... Tadah!

144
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,135
My, you are prepared...

145
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,339
Actually, me too...

146
00:11:31,615 --> 00:11:34,607
I brought one too! See, see?

147
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:38,752
I guess Ami was the only one who
was seriously thinking about Mako-chan.

148
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:40,347
Ami is in a class by
herself, after all!

149
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,355
A-Actually, I...

150
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, man! A meal just
has to be like THIS!

151
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:07,448
M-Mamo-chan!

152
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:09,418
Oh... Usako?

153
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:10,647
Is everyone here?

154
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:13,952
What a coincidence,
to meet here of all places!

155
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,652
Gee, you really can't lie well...

156
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:19,321
Mamo-chan, let's go out
somewhere and play!

157
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:22,557
Sorry, but I don't have time for that.

158
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:26,057
This place pays really well,
but the workload is pretty tough...

159
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:28,469
Hey, Chiba! Come over here for a sec!

160
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:29,335
Sure!

161
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,335
How boring.

162
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,002
Cute...

163
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,568
All four of them aren't bad.

164
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:37,477
That girl is rather cute.

165
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:39,141
Hey, why don't you go talk to them?

166
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:42,151
That girl's eyes really
catch my attention!

167
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:43,345
So wonderful...

168
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:45,911
Hurry up and go over there!
Come on!

169
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:48,356
Hey, those girls over
there are even better!

170
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:49,085
Oh, you're right!

171
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:50,855
Let's go over there!

172
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,860
W-What was that...?

173
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,446
Huh? It's Haruka and Michiru!

174
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:15,146
Oh, so you're here too, buns-head?

175
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:15,981
Yeah!

176
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,111
Hello!

177
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:18,314
What a coincidence...

178
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:20,846
Michiru, your swimsuit is gorgeous!

179
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:22,017
Thank you.

180
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:24,652
But your swimsuits are all lovely, too.

181
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:28,130
I-Is it really that great...?

182
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,626
Usagi, why don't we start heading back?

183
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,295
B-But, I want to stay
here a little longer...

184
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:35,463
Usagi, no matter how
long you hold out here...

185
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,632
...you won't be able to
go on a date with Mamoru!

186
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:39,835
Hah! Bull's-eye!

187
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:42,106
Sheesh, Rei, you're so mean to me!

188
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,976
Take that!

189
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:55,088
The wind is bringing me
the scent of the humid sea.

190
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,889
Something IS going to happen.

191
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:09,002
Just like Rei said,
I couldn't go on a date!

192
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:34,190
H-He's asleep...

193
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:42,538
Sorry about that...

194
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:45,132
You're in the middle
of your training...

195
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:49,771
Sometimes it is important to relax
and get rid of the excess power.

196
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:51,872
Was that a poor excuse?

197
00:14:57,787 --> 00:14:58,776
Get out of the way!

198
00:14:58,822 --> 00:14:59,880
Captured!

199
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:10,733
Mr. Kakusui!

200
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:14,066
People... cannot live alone...

201
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:16,265
Don't force yourself...

202
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,534
Mr. Kakusui!!

203
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:27,077
JUPITER STAR POWER...

204
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:29,642
...MAKE UP!

205
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,464
MOON COSMIC POWER...

206
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:53,032
...MAKE UP!

207
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,932
Oh?

208
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:32,437
I, Sailor Jupiter, will not forgive
anyone putting their hands on Mr. Kakusui!

209
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,947
A Daimohn is enough
to fight against you.

210
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:41,020
Appear before me, Daimohn!

211
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,126
Darumah!

212
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:05,172
Hold it right there!

213
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,774
Even if your evil plans make
heroes of justice stumble 7 times...

214
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,186
...they will always
stand up an 8th time!

215
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:14,713
For love and justice...

216
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:17,192
A pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

217
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:23,188
Sailor Moon!

218
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:28,465
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

219
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,871
And we'll chastise you, too!

220
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:35,367
Leave this to me!

221
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:37,880
This time, I'll make sure
I defeat this thing by myself!

222
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:41,578
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

223
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:59,998
Thanks for the hard work,
but this isn't a talisman.

224
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:07,401
She sure runs away quickly...

225
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:11,338
Shall we help?

226
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,780
I'll do it myself...

227
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:13,908
I'll defeat it by myself!

228
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,248
Don't force yourself to do so.

229
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:35,165
Jupiter, don't force yourself to do
this! We can combine our powers!

230
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:37,230
The five of us come together as one!

231
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:38,604
Believe in everyone!

232
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:39,938
We all fight together!

233
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:44,476
People... cannot live alone...

234
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:45,606
Don't force yourself...

235
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:49,445
I'll believe in everyone...
And I'll fight with everyone!

236
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,846
Now!

237
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:17,774
Sometimes it is important to relax
and get rid of the excess power.

238
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:34,293
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

239
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,831
It looks like Mako-chan resolved
whatever it was that was worrying her.

240
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:20,831
