00:02.015 --> 00:05.542
Michiru, who I look up to,
invites me to a concert.

00:08.221 --> 00:11.554
But another problem appears there!

00:12.326 --> 00:15.693
To you, who gets in the way
of a nice romantic night...

00:15.729 --> 00:20.530
...I, Sailor Moon, will punish
you in the name of the moon!

00:31.720 --> 00:33.278
Mamo-chan!

00:34.023 --> 00:35.513
It's Usako!

00:35.557 --> 00:37.787
I brought some delicious cookies!

00:40.929 --> 00:44.057
And... I-I-If there is love,
I'm sure 1 or 2...

00:44.099 --> 00:47.364
...or 3 or 4... burnt ones
won't get in the way!

00:54.977 --> 00:56.706
Mamo-chan?

01:03.252 --> 01:05.720
Such a mature atmosphere as always...

01:06.822 --> 01:10.223
F-Future Considerations
of Genetic Engineering...?

01:13.495 --> 01:15.622
Mamo-chan is in college!

01:15.664 --> 01:17.928
He's at a really high level!

01:30.846 --> 01:35.044
I guess it doesn't fit Mamo-chan...

01:35.084 --> 01:37.552
These charred cookies...

01:43.792 --> 01:45.555
Usako.

01:46.195 --> 01:49.028
I really am good for nothing.

01:49.064 --> 01:52.864
What are you saying all of a sudden?

01:53.402 --> 01:57.634
I fail as Mamo-chan's wife after all!

01:57.673 --> 02:00.267
D-Don't cry...

02:05.314 --> 02:07.578
It's not bad to have
something on the bitter side...

02:08.517 --> 02:09.575
Mamo-chan...

02:10.352 --> 02:13.082
Usako, you're fine the way you are now.

02:13.122 --> 02:15.556
Mamo-chan!

02:24.433 --> 02:28.665
And so Mamoru ate all
of the charred cookies?

02:29.705 --> 02:31.036
Poor thing.

02:31.073 --> 02:32.904
I hope he didn't get
an upset stomach from it.

02:33.242 --> 02:34.436
What do you mean by that!?

02:34.476 --> 02:36.637
She's right, that's saying too much.

02:37.479 --> 02:38.912
Ami!

02:39.314 --> 02:41.782
If it was thoroughly cooked,
there is little...

02:41.817 --> 02:44.149
...chance that he'd get
food poisoning from it.

02:48.657 --> 02:49.453
Usagi.

02:49.491 --> 02:50.651
She's gonna get mad!

02:59.401 --> 03:01.926
Today's Usa-chan is a good Usa-chan!

03:02.404 --> 03:04.304
Say, Ami?

03:04.339 --> 03:07.035
I want you to teach me something!

03:07.075 --> 03:08.303
W-What is it?

03:09.044 --> 03:12.309
Generic... No, genetic engineering!

03:12.981 --> 03:15.449
And Mako-chan!

03:15.484 --> 03:17.418
Can you teach me how to cook?

03:17.453 --> 03:19.444
T-Teach you cooking, Usagi!?

03:19.488 --> 03:21.786
Genetic engineering?

03:21.857 --> 03:24.291
I decided that I want to
be even a little bit...

03:24.326 --> 03:27.318
...closer to where my lovely
Mamo-chan is right now!

03:27.930 --> 03:30.831
Minako, you're great
with English, right?

03:31.600 --> 03:32.828
Why?

03:34.036 --> 03:37.199
Rei... would be how to wear a kimono.

03:37.239 --> 03:40.299
Yeah! That perfects my
preparations to be a wife!

03:40.342 --> 03:42.003
Preparing to become a wife?

03:42.044 --> 03:45.741
Oh, no! Crap! I forgot
I had something to do!

03:45.781 --> 03:48.079
M-Me too! I have to get back!

03:49.218 --> 03:51.083
Mako-chan? Minako?

03:51.420 --> 03:53.581
I'll see you tomorrow!

03:56.658 --> 03:59.821
Um, Usagi, I think you'd
be better off studying...

03:59.862 --> 04:03.093
...biology and chemistry for our
school before genetic engineering...

04:03.332 --> 04:04.890
It's all right, Ami.

04:04.933 --> 04:07.401
She's just being whimsical as usual!

04:07.436 --> 04:08.596
What do you mean by that, Rei?

04:10.339 --> 04:13.103
When I was teaching you how
to wear a priestess's kimono...

04:13.141 --> 04:15.769
...I told you many, MANY times
but you never got it!

04:16.044 --> 04:19.536
To be your teacher is something
I never everwant to do at all, Usagi!

04:22.851 --> 04:24.842
Rei, you meanie!

04:25.921 --> 04:28.947
Can you say all that, Usagi?

04:29.591 --> 04:31.491
When you learn
cooking from Mako-chan...

04:31.527 --> 04:33.825
...or get tutored by Ami...

04:33.862 --> 04:36.262
...you always quit within three days!

04:36.298 --> 04:38.732
Everyone is sick of it already!

04:40.068 --> 04:43.094
Really, at this rate
Mamoru will probably...

04:43.138 --> 04:46.107
...say that he doesn't want
to marry you anymore!

04:46.141 --> 04:48.974
Hey, Usagi, are you listening!

04:49.912 --> 04:53.507
That's why I wanted to do my best...

04:54.516 --> 04:57.485
But, Luna... even Luna...

04:57.953 --> 05:00.353
Usagi...

05:01.089 --> 05:03.489
Oh... I guess she really
was serious about this...

05:08.931 --> 05:11.729
Luna, you idiot!

05:29.518 --> 05:34.353
At least there's no doubt that strong
powers are concentrated in this city.

05:34.656 --> 05:39.958
And when that power grows especially
strong... those mysterious evil things...

05:40.462 --> 05:42.054
...attack humans!

05:42.097 --> 05:43.962
Nothing will come from worrying.

05:43.999 --> 05:48.800
What we are given is a very vague memory
of our past life that came back to us.

05:49.938 --> 05:54.068
Our mission is to find
the three talismans...

05:54.109 --> 05:57.272
...call for the holy grail which is the
source of an extreme amount of power...

05:57.312 --> 06:01.078
...and return it to the rightful
owner as soon as possible.

06:01.116 --> 06:06.418
Who are the three owners of the pure
hearts that hide the talismans?

06:06.455 --> 06:08.184
If only we knew who they were...

06:08.223 --> 06:13.820
But to extract those talismans means
the death of the respective owners.

06:13.996 --> 06:15.759
We can't help that.

06:15.797 --> 06:18.561
To meet the ultimate objective
of saving the world...

06:18.600 --> 06:21.398
...a few sacrifices
have to be made.

06:21.903 --> 06:26.840
If that's the mission given to us,
we can only plunge onward!

06:38.820 --> 06:40.811
Haruka...

06:42.190 --> 06:43.316
This is it!

06:43.725 --> 06:47.252
This is the ideal princess figure!

06:47.295 --> 06:48.785
That bun-headed girl from before...

06:48.830 --> 06:50.991
Do you want something from us?

06:51.199 --> 06:55.499
U-Um, I was just awed that you
could play a violin like that...

06:55.537 --> 06:58.472
Like a princess...
no, um, it's very mature...

06:58.507 --> 07:01.101
I look up to people like that!

07:21.363 --> 07:23.388
Well, I'll be going.

07:23.432 --> 07:25.297
Uh... Um...

07:25.333 --> 07:27.164
I'm just a little frustrated...

07:27.202 --> 07:29.397
I'll go on a little spin
and cool my head off.

07:29.438 --> 07:31.099
Bye, bun-head!

07:32.340 --> 07:34.808
Somehow I don't feel
angry at all... but...

07:34.843 --> 07:37.107
They're not buns!

07:45.654 --> 07:51.786
She knows this isn't a problem that
aimlessly running around will solve...

07:58.400 --> 08:00.300
Miss Tsukino... was it?

08:00.335 --> 08:02.235
Call me Usagi.

08:02.270 --> 08:04.738
All right... Usagi?

08:04.773 --> 08:06.638
Yes!

08:09.377 --> 08:13.905
Michiru, are you going to
become a violinist in the future?

08:14.216 --> 08:15.183
I don't know...

08:15.217 --> 08:20.086
I'm... not sure why I was born...

08:20.122 --> 08:23.421
I can't get a hold of which road I
should take... and I'm lost, so to say.

08:24.192 --> 08:26.888
That's like me! I'm lost too!

08:26.928 --> 08:29.419
Um, you're Michiru Kaioh, right?

08:29.731 --> 08:31.164
The one who painted this picture?

08:42.544 --> 08:45.240
I'm a big fan of your art!

08:45.280 --> 08:48.113
I'm looking forward to
the upcoming exhibition, too!

08:48.150 --> 08:48.946
Thank you.

08:50.152 --> 08:51.619
She paints, too?

08:51.653 --> 08:55.487
She's not like me at all! She's lost
because she has too much talent!

08:55.524 --> 08:58.652
But, but... Me too!

09:06.334 --> 09:07.460
I feel better now.

09:07.502 --> 09:13.998
I thought about finding their HQ as well
but, of course, it's not really that easy.

09:21.550 --> 09:23.814
H-Hey!

09:24.486 --> 09:27.319
I see, that's why you
wanted to play the violin.

09:27.889 --> 09:32.326
But it's no good. Even if I wanted
Mamo-chan to hear it, I can't get better.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.521
Don't give up, Usagi.

09:34.563 --> 09:37.088
You look wonderful when you're trying.

09:37.132 --> 09:40.568
Girls always get better that way.

09:41.636 --> 09:43.069
Michiru...

09:43.305 --> 09:44.533
I'll give this to you.

09:44.573 --> 09:46.871
There is a wonderful
violin recital coming up.

09:46.908 --> 09:48.569
It's this evening.

09:48.777 --> 09:51.337
Please come with
the person you cherish.

09:51.947 --> 09:53.847
S-Sure!

09:58.720 --> 10:01.587
The time has come.

10:02.023 --> 10:05.618
Kaorinite. How are
your preparations coming?

10:05.660 --> 10:07.594
I have a good idea already.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.097
Now, go, egg of Daimohn.

10:10.799 --> 10:12.596
Go steal a pure heart.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.635
A tuxedo without a mask
is also wonderful!

10:48.670 --> 10:50.228
I'm so happy!

10:50.272 --> 10:53.833
But a violin concert...
Aren't you trying a little too hard?

10:53.875 --> 10:58.005
Excuse me! I may look like this,
but I am a future princess!

10:58.046 --> 10:58.842
Usagi!

10:58.880 --> 10:59.904
Usagi!

11:00.448 --> 11:01.915
Everyone...

11:02.784 --> 11:05.150
You're all going to say
this isn't like me, right?

11:05.186 --> 11:06.448
I'm sorry about earlier!

11:06.488 --> 11:08.979
You really were serious
about learning how to cook.

11:09.024 --> 11:12.152
I heard from Luna that
you guys were here, Usagi.

11:12.427 --> 11:14.156
I'm sorry, Usagi.

11:14.696 --> 11:16.288
Well, leave everything to me!

11:16.331 --> 11:20.233
If you fall asleep during the performance,
I'll pinch your butt and wake you up!

11:20.268 --> 11:23.669
Are you fine with your music lessons?

11:23.905 --> 11:25.668
Oh, Ami!

12:12.721 --> 12:13.551
Oh, there he is.

12:13.588 --> 12:15.783
He's a pretty attractive guy.

12:15.924 --> 12:18.518
It's so nice to be young.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.289
You sound like an old woman!

12:20.795 --> 12:22.319
Oh, really?

12:50.191 --> 12:52.489
Usagi! Look in front of you!
In front of you!

12:52.527 --> 12:55.325
Where were YOU looking, Rei?

12:55.363 --> 12:57.854
I was watching!
I was looking in front of me!

13:13.648 --> 13:14.410
Usako!

13:14.449 --> 13:15.507
Mamo-chan!

13:25.393 --> 13:27.725
OCTAVE!

13:40.708 --> 13:43.176
OCTAVE!

13:53.354 --> 13:55.151
Hurry! Go outside!

13:58.960 --> 13:59.722
Usagi!

13:59.761 --> 14:00.659
What's wrong?

14:01.096 --> 14:02.654
OCTAVE!

14:02.864 --> 14:03.728
It's coming!

14:03.765 --> 14:05.164
Everyone, transform!

14:05.400 --> 14:07.994
MERCURY STAR POWER...

14:08.036 --> 14:10.561
MARS STAR POWER...

14:10.605 --> 14:13.005
JUPITER STAR POWER...

14:13.041 --> 14:15.168
VENUS STAR POWER...

14:17.345 --> 14:20.678
MOON COSMIC POWER...

14:23.618 --> 14:25.449
...MAKE UP!

15:18.239 --> 15:20.571
OCTAVE!

15:22.977 --> 15:24.342
Hold it right there!

15:26.681 --> 15:31.209
You wrecked my important,
very important romantic night!

15:31.252 --> 15:34.244
Maidens, love with all of your life!

15:34.289 --> 15:36.655
The sailor team of
pretty soldiers will...

15:38.426 --> 15:40.724
...in the name of the moon...

15:40.762 --> 15:42.320
...punish you!

15:45.433 --> 15:48.197
OCTAVE!

15:52.140 --> 15:53.198
I-I can't move!

16:17.432 --> 16:18.626
OWW!

16:19.400 --> 16:21.129
Tuxedo Mask!

16:24.239 --> 16:27.333
A serenade fits a
beautiful moonlit night.

16:27.375 --> 16:30.139
Noise that is painful to listen
to shall all disappear immediately!

16:31.946 --> 16:34.278
OCTAVE!

16:34.716 --> 16:36.013
SPARKLING...

16:36.050 --> 16:38.484
...WIDE PRESSURE!

16:44.459 --> 16:48.156
Be careful! There are a lot
of people in the concert hall!

16:51.933 --> 16:53.093
That's such a cowardly move!

16:53.134 --> 16:55.796
Really! It's got a twisted personality!

16:57.138 --> 16:59.129
OCTAVE!

17:01.175 --> 17:03.871
DEEP SUBMERGE!

17:06.281 --> 17:07.077
You guys...!

17:11.085 --> 17:15.784
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Uranus acts with elegance!

17:15.823 --> 17:18.587
Same here. I am Sailor Neptune!

17:18.960 --> 17:20.552
Uranus! Neptune!

17:20.595 --> 17:21.755
What in the world do you--

17:22.030 --> 17:25.522
Whoa. I ask you not to
do any unnecessary probing.

17:25.566 --> 17:29.161
Our objective is to find the talismans.

17:29.203 --> 17:31.763
Other than that, we have
nothing to do with each other.

17:32.006 --> 17:35.134
Nothing to do with each other!?

17:35.176 --> 17:39.010
I thought you were our allies, but it
seems like you guys are pretty hardheaded!

17:44.285 --> 17:45.115
Look out!

17:45.153 --> 17:47.713
OCTAVE!

17:50.591 --> 17:51.580
Thank you.

17:51.626 --> 17:53.116
Oh, you're welcome...

17:53.361 --> 17:55.124
Dammit! How dare you!?

17:58.099 --> 18:00.260
WORLD...

18:00.301 --> 18:02.633
...SHAKING!

18:09.110 --> 18:10.941
Now, Sailor Moon!

18:10.978 --> 18:12.309
Oh, o-okay!

18:32.266 --> 18:34.962
MOON SPIRAL...

18:35.970 --> 18:39.167
...HEART...

18:39.207 --> 18:41.698
...ATTACK!

18:50.685 --> 18:53.017
Lovely!

19:11.773 --> 19:13.764
She took the best part.

19:13.808 --> 19:15.537
Uranus?

19:15.576 --> 19:17.840
No, it's not a talisman.

19:17.879 --> 19:19.437
It looks like another wasted trip.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.380
Uranus! Neptune!

19:21.616 --> 19:23.641
Who in the world are you?

19:23.684 --> 19:25.379
And what are the talismans?

19:26.320 --> 19:30.848
If you really want to know,
figure it out on your own.

19:30.892 --> 19:35.090
The heart of an artist that performs
a graceful tune is very delicate.

19:35.129 --> 19:38.121
Take care in returning it.

19:38.733 --> 19:39.893
Oh, wait!

19:39.934 --> 19:42.664
They don't have any manners!

19:42.703 --> 19:46.400
But... they seem like good people...

19:53.514 --> 19:57.041
It's a shame... we missed out on
listening to a wonderful performance.

19:57.084 --> 20:00.144
How about I treat you
to a meal in its place?

20:01.522 --> 20:02.682
Lucky me!

20:02.723 --> 20:03.883
Usagi.

20:03.925 --> 20:05.688
What about those lessons
to become a wife?

20:05.726 --> 20:08.820
I-I'll start that again tomorrow!
Okay?

20:10.965 --> 20:15.732
Of course you're going to treat
us as well, right Mamoru?

20:16.537 --> 20:20.268
- HEY! Stop clinging onto him!
- Chinese food! Definitely Chinese!

20:20.308 --> 20:26.247
- No, let's go French and have some wine!
- What are you saying? We're under age!

20:28.015 --> 20:29.141
How cute.

20:29.183 --> 20:31.777
I guess so...

20:34.777 --> 20:38.777
