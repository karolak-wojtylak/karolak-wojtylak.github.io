00:02.000 --> 00:06.630
A flower's life is short,
and is mostly filled with pain.

00:06.671 --> 00:12.041
I can't forgive using such
pretty flowers for bad things!

00:12.510 --> 00:15.035
You're being rude to those
good flower shop owners!

00:16.982 --> 00:19.542
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

00:21.000 --> 00:22.490
S-Stop!

00:22.935 --> 00:24.869
Farewell, idiot.

00:25.605 --> 00:28.631
NOOOOO!!!

00:29.942 --> 00:31.603
F-Fighting amongst themselves...?

00:31.644 --> 00:34.442
What in the world is going on?

00:34.480 --> 00:35.811
Super Sailor Moon!?

00:35.848 --> 00:36.644
Are you all right!

00:36.682 --> 00:38.172
Hang in there!

00:41.387 --> 00:43.821
To eradicate their own ally...

00:43.856 --> 00:45.118
Horrible people they are...

00:45.157 --> 00:47.421
We can't be too idealistic, either.

00:48.828 --> 00:49.852
Let's go.

00:49.895 --> 00:54.195
We must defeat the Messiah of
Silence as quickly as possible.

00:56.402 --> 00:58.700
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto!

00:59.138 --> 01:00.162
Wait!

01:09.248 --> 01:10.681
Wait!

01:11.050 --> 01:12.984
Don't you lay your hands on Hotaru!

01:13.019 --> 01:15.044
Hotaru isn't a bad girl!

01:15.321 --> 01:18.256
I believe that there is another way.

01:18.290 --> 01:20.656
That's right!
There's got to be another way!

01:20.693 --> 01:24.288
No matter how many ideals you line up
with your mouth, this battle will not end...

01:24.597 --> 01:28.226
But if all of us think together,
there has to be a good way...

01:28.267 --> 01:30.292
It's too early to give up.

01:30.736 --> 01:31.634
Uranus...

01:31.671 --> 01:33.332
Haruka, we...

01:33.372 --> 01:34.304
It's no use!

01:34.940 --> 01:37.067
We have no time for ideals...

01:37.109 --> 01:41.478
Both the Messiah of Silence and
Sailor Saturn will be sealed away by us!

01:41.514 --> 01:43.072
Compared to you...

01:43.115 --> 01:45.208
...we long for a different world.

01:45.251 --> 01:46.582
You can't!

01:46.619 --> 01:48.985
Hotaru is my friend!

01:49.021 --> 01:51.956
I believe in her!
Hotaru is not at fault!!

01:52.491 --> 01:54.823
I'll protect Hotaru!

01:54.860 --> 01:55.952
I will protect her!

01:57.296 --> 02:00.060
I will protect her...

02:00.099 --> 02:02.567
Chibiusa...

02:07.173 --> 02:09.471
Pure hearts... are they here yet?

02:09.942 --> 02:11.967
I am terribly sorry...

02:12.578 --> 02:14.239
Please wait a while longer.

02:14.647 --> 02:16.274
Pure hearts...

02:16.315 --> 02:19.876
And lots of them.
Unless I get a hold of them...

02:19.919 --> 02:23.013
...it is impossible for me
to be fully awakened.

02:23.055 --> 02:27.754
I will not forgive anyone who
gets in the way of my revival!

02:33.599 --> 02:35.464
Chibiusa...

02:35.768 --> 02:36.962
Messiah!

02:38.404 --> 02:40.235
No need to worry...

02:40.272 --> 02:41.830
Just collect...

02:41.874 --> 02:43.273
...the pure hearts.

02:43.309 --> 02:44.469
Yes!

02:57.790 --> 03:01.021
Yes, this is Telulu's desk at Witches 5.

03:01.060 --> 03:03.187
Hello, it's me...

03:03.229 --> 03:04.093
Professor!

03:04.130 --> 03:07.531
I just glanced through you report.

03:07.566 --> 03:12.060
I have gotten to like your plan to
use plants to steal the pure hearts.

03:12.104 --> 03:14.072
Thank you very much.

03:14.106 --> 03:18.975
The plans that use daimohns
have been failing as of late.

03:19.378 --> 03:23.178
I thought it was interesting to change
how we approach things a bit for once.

03:23.215 --> 03:24.375
I'm counting on you...

03:24.416 --> 03:25.644
... Telulu.

03:25.684 --> 03:28.175
Leave it to me.

03:29.655 --> 03:33.819
The plans are completely ready.

03:33.859 --> 03:35.827
Then start the operation!

03:35.861 --> 03:37.226
Yes!

03:38.564 --> 03:40.054
Professor.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.227
Kaori...

03:42.268 --> 03:44.498
I brought you some coffee.

03:44.537 --> 03:46.971
Thank you.

03:47.573 --> 03:48.870
What's the matter...?

03:48.908 --> 03:51.570
Lately, everything has been worrying me...

03:51.610 --> 03:53.100
My shoulders feel rather...

03:53.145 --> 03:54.737
I'll massage them.

03:55.614 --> 03:57.479
Sorry to trouble you so much all the time.

03:57.516 --> 03:59.006
No...

03:59.051 --> 04:03.681
You perfectly support my
Job as my secretary.

04:03.722 --> 04:05.189
But of course.

04:05.224 --> 04:08.751
You revived me after I died
the first time, Professor.

04:08.794 --> 04:12.355
I'll do anything to be of use to you...

04:12.398 --> 04:13.797
Because I...

04:13.833 --> 04:18.930
It really is a shame to use all
of your skills just as a secretary...

04:19.638 --> 04:23.130
You know what I'm talking about...
Right, Kaori?

04:23.175 --> 04:26.906
I want you to go back into the field...

04:27.580 --> 04:30.048
But... I...

04:30.616 --> 04:32.550
I'm counting on you...

04:37.423 --> 04:39.288
Professor... I...!!

04:39.959 --> 04:42.393
You are the only one I can count on...

04:42.428 --> 04:43.793
Kaorinite...

04:48.234 --> 04:50.759
Professor...

05:13.392 --> 05:15.326
How about some flowers?

05:15.527 --> 05:18.291
A plant that doesn't need water or fertilizers!

05:18.330 --> 05:20.798
How about a Telulun,
a flower that brings happiness?

05:20.833 --> 05:24.360
In two or three days,
a cute pink flower will bloom!

05:24.403 --> 05:29.170
Now, about the price --
a special introductory price of...

05:29.208 --> 05:31.836
Just 1 0 yen!
How about that!?

05:31.877 --> 05:34.471
Wow, that's cheap!
I'll take it!

05:34.513 --> 05:36.003
Would you like a Telulun?

05:36.048 --> 05:37.072
How about a Telulun...?

05:37.116 --> 05:40.051
Telulun? I've never heard of such a flower...

06:11.450 --> 06:13.975
W-Wait a minute!

06:15.788 --> 06:18.086
I can't take it anymore!
I can't walk another step!

06:18.123 --> 06:20.956
What is she bolting out like that for?
She's such a bullet-girl!

06:20.993 --> 06:22.426
Usagi!

06:22.461 --> 06:23.860
What?!

06:23.896 --> 06:26.296
Aren't you worried about Chibiusa?

06:26.332 --> 06:30.268
Worried...? She just said she was
going on a walk when she left!

06:30.302 --> 06:33.533
Why do I have to do something like this!?

06:33.572 --> 06:34.766
Because...

06:34.807 --> 06:38.265
She seemed to be deeply worried
about Hotaru or something...

06:38.310 --> 06:40.244
So I'm just a little worried.

06:40.279 --> 06:43.077
I don't think she's "just"
out on a walk, though...

06:43.115 --> 06:44.844
You're right...

06:45.317 --> 06:47.547
She sure is a troublesome child.

06:47.586 --> 06:48.416
Usagi...

06:48.454 --> 06:51.753
But you and your daughter
really have similar personalities...

06:51.790 --> 06:52.848
You say one thing too many!

06:52.891 --> 06:55.451
I can't help it!
You really are mother and daughter!

06:55.494 --> 06:57.621
Why can't you end things on a good note!?

06:57.663 --> 07:01.394
That lethargic attitude makes
me want to say one last thing!

07:01.433 --> 07:02.400
What did you say!?

07:02.434 --> 07:06.427
Let's cut it out... both of you...

07:07.840 --> 07:08.932
What!?

07:08.974 --> 07:11.670
Y-You know... I just realized this...

07:11.710 --> 07:12.699
What?

07:12.745 --> 07:13.575
Ahead of here...

07:13.612 --> 07:14.670
What about it?

07:14.713 --> 07:17.580
...is Mugen Academy, maybe?

07:17.616 --> 07:18.878
Huh?

07:24.757 --> 07:27.317
Looks like nobody is here...

07:27.593 --> 07:31.586
Just you wait, Hotaru...
I'll make sure to save you.

07:31.630 --> 07:34.258
All right... I'll now sneak in...

07:34.299 --> 07:36.096
...to investigate!

07:37.703 --> 07:40.638
What are you doing...?

07:41.540 --> 07:44.304
It's dangerous for you to go
to such a place by yourself!.

07:44.777 --> 07:48.235
That place might be the
Death Busters' headquarters!

07:48.280 --> 07:49.872
I know that...

07:49.915 --> 07:51.075
Then, why?

07:51.650 --> 07:54.585
I'm sure that Hotaru is
captured by bad guys!

07:54.620 --> 07:56.554
Hotaru is in Mugen Academy!

07:56.588 --> 07:58.579
Even I can tell something like that!

07:59.158 --> 08:01.058
I want to...

08:01.093 --> 08:03.186
...save Hotaru.

08:03.228 --> 08:04.957
Chibiusa...

08:12.037 --> 08:14.528
Everyone feels the same way.

08:14.573 --> 08:17.974
We will definitely save Hotaru...

08:18.010 --> 08:19.409
Definitely...?

08:19.445 --> 08:20.776
Yeah...

08:20.813 --> 08:23.338
Leave it to your big sisters!

08:25.851 --> 08:26.840
All right!

08:37.096 --> 08:38.893
Chibiusa...

08:38.931 --> 08:41.866
What am I doing in a place like this...?

08:41.900 --> 08:44.368
Chibiusa...

08:46.672 --> 08:50.369
The power to absorb water
in the atmosphere into its body...?

08:50.943 --> 08:52.843
Impossible!

08:52.878 --> 08:55.142
To think that a plant like this exists...

08:55.180 --> 08:59.310
That strange incident where
massive amounts of plants wilted...

08:59.351 --> 09:02.878
Perhaps it has something
to do with this flower...?

09:02.921 --> 09:03.751
What...!?

09:22.808 --> 09:24.776
The Garnet Rod...

09:24.810 --> 09:27.244
...it protected me!?

09:28.347 --> 09:30.508
Hey, miss over there.

09:30.983 --> 09:34.510
This is a flower that brings happiness.
Would you like one?

09:35.087 --> 09:36.748
A flower that brings happiness?

09:37.089 --> 09:39.455
This is the last one I have.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.425
So, I'll give it to you.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.223
A flower that brings happiness...

09:43.896 --> 09:46.330
It will probably go with Chibiusa well.

09:46.365 --> 09:48.799
Thank you.

09:49.868 --> 09:51.961
First stage is now complete.

09:52.704 --> 09:54.968
Chibiusa...

10:17.629 --> 10:19.790
Yes!

10:21.300 --> 10:23.200
Who is it?

10:24.570 --> 10:26.435
Hotaru!

10:27.039 --> 10:28.370
Chibiusa.

10:28.407 --> 10:31.001
You're all right!
I wanted to see you!

10:31.043 --> 10:32.237
Me, too...

10:32.277 --> 10:33.710
Chibiusa...

10:34.179 --> 10:35.544
A guest?

10:35.581 --> 10:37.071
Hotaru!

10:37.916 --> 10:40.077
What's with that attitude!?

10:41.620 --> 10:44.054
I wanted... to give you this, Chibiusa.

10:44.089 --> 10:45.283
Thanks!

10:45.324 --> 10:47.087
I heard it's a flower that brings happiness.

10:47.659 --> 10:50.059
I thought it was perfect for you, Chibiusa.

10:50.095 --> 10:52.586
It goes with you well, too, Hotaru!

10:53.599 --> 10:55.396
It's not for me...

10:55.434 --> 10:56.924
That's not true!

10:56.969 --> 11:01.099
I hurt other people without knowing it.

11:01.740 --> 11:04.868
There's another selfinside me
that I don't know about.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.936
And that's why I'm afraid to make friends...

11:07.980 --> 11:13.509
But... you ease those
feelings of mine, Chibiusa...

11:13.552 --> 11:15.782
So, I...

11:15.821 --> 11:16.685
Hotaru!

11:16.722 --> 11:18.314
Hotaru!

11:18.357 --> 11:19.619
I...

11:19.658 --> 11:22.388
I want your pure heart...

11:23.662 --> 11:24.720
Hotaru...?

11:26.732 --> 11:28.359
What's wrong, Hotaru?

11:28.400 --> 11:29.458
Chibiusa!

11:32.404 --> 11:33.428
Stop!!

11:35.340 --> 11:36.637
Hotaru?

11:37.976 --> 11:40.945
What did I...Just now...?

11:41.480 --> 11:44.449
Chibiusa, save me!

11:44.483 --> 11:47.247
I'm... afraid...

11:47.286 --> 11:49.220
It'll be all right.

11:50.422 --> 11:53.255
I'm here to pick you up, Hotaru...

11:53.792 --> 11:54.850
You can't!

11:54.893 --> 11:56.087
Get out of the way.

11:57.396 --> 11:58.420
Chibiusa!

11:59.498 --> 12:01.056
Chibiusa!!

12:01.099 --> 12:02.123
Hotaru!

12:06.805 --> 12:08.568
Hotaru...

12:09.174 --> 12:11.642
There's no doubt -- that was Kaorinite.

12:11.677 --> 12:14.305
But I thought we defeated her...

12:14.346 --> 12:17.907
But we couldn't confirm
that Kaorinite died at the scene.

12:17.949 --> 12:21.407
- But...
- I couldn't protect Hotaru...

12:22.054 --> 12:24.818
She was relying on me, too...

12:24.856 --> 12:27.654
Don't blame your self so much!

12:28.093 --> 12:30.687
But... I couldn't be of any aid to her.

12:30.729 --> 12:31.923
Hello...

12:32.331 --> 12:33.923
Setsuna...

12:33.965 --> 12:34.932
Plu...

12:38.770 --> 12:39.930
Small Lady!

12:47.679 --> 12:48.839
S-Setsuna?

12:50.749 --> 12:52.080
What are you doing!?

12:52.117 --> 12:55.018
Hotaru came all the way
over here to give it to me!

12:55.053 --> 13:00.958
That means that Hotaru might be
after your pure heart, Small Lady.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.135
This is about all it does while it's a bud...

13:11.169 --> 13:13.637
...but when it blooms,
it will start to abduct people's pure hearts.

13:13.872 --> 13:17.569
If all the flowers that are now all
over town started blooming at once...

13:17.609 --> 13:18.871
Oh, no!!

13:18.910 --> 13:21.208
It's different from what
they've been doing until now!

13:21.246 --> 13:26.377
Perhaps there is a situation now that
requires them to have many pure hearts.

13:26.685 --> 13:27.811
But what should we do...?

13:27.853 --> 13:29.787
We must get rid of it at the source.

13:29.821 --> 13:31.652
Let me do it!

13:31.823 --> 13:36.021
I'll prove that Hotaru
has nothing to do with it!

13:41.800 --> 13:44.564
Telulun is being sold at that store.

13:44.603 --> 13:45.831
Then, for starters--

13:45.871 --> 13:47.498
Let's go around to the back entrance!

13:47.539 --> 13:50.736
I was just about to say that!

13:51.143 --> 13:52.405
W-Wait a minute!

13:54.646 --> 13:56.409
Welcome!

13:57.315 --> 14:00.751
Considering how many I got all over town,
my preparations are complete!

14:01.186 --> 14:05.589
First, I'll take the pure
hearts of the people here!

14:22.607 --> 14:23.938
Dear customers...

14:24.109 --> 14:26.134
You are very lucky people!

14:26.178 --> 14:29.477
To be able to purchase Telulun in bloom!

14:29.514 --> 14:32.813
The price is your pure heart.

14:33.618 --> 14:36.052
What are you!?

14:52.204 --> 14:54.434
I guess it's just like what you said, Setsuna...

14:54.473 --> 14:56.202
Impossible...

14:56.241 --> 14:59.335
But Hotaru didn't know anything about this.

14:59.377 --> 15:00.503
Let's save everyone!

15:03.582 --> 15:06.608
MOON COSMIC POWER...

15:06.651 --> 15:08.744
MAKE UP!

15:10.555 --> 15:13.149
PLUTO PLANET POWER...

15:13.191 --> 15:15.421
MAKE UP!

15:16.361 --> 15:18.261
MOON PRISM POWER...

15:18.296 --> 15:20.628
MAKE UP!

15:53.865 --> 15:55.457
Come on!

15:56.401 --> 16:00.394
A flower's life is short,
and is mostly filled with pain.

16:00.438 --> 16:03.464
I can't forgive using such flowers
for bad things just as they bloom!

16:04.643 --> 16:07.840
For love and justice,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

16:07.879 --> 16:09.471
Sailor Moon!

16:11.116 --> 16:14.711
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

16:14.753 --> 16:16.414
Sailor Soldiers, huh...

16:16.454 --> 16:18.854
To find out about
this place so quickly...

16:18.890 --> 16:20.414
You aren't as stupid as I thought.

16:20.458 --> 16:21.891
You're the stupid one!

16:21.927 --> 16:24.725
Because of you, Hotaru was
being suspected for all of this!

16:25.063 --> 16:29.591
Shut up, brat!
I guess I'll take your pure hearts as well.

16:33.538 --> 16:35.062
It's no use to escape.

16:35.106 --> 16:37.006
This shop is filled with Telulun.

16:37.509 --> 16:39.875
I'll blow all of those things away!

16:40.345 --> 16:43.712
Lend me your powers, Pink Moon Stick!

16:43.748 --> 16:47.115
PINK SUGAR HEART ATTACK!

16:52.490 --> 16:54.754
I was curious, but that's so weak!

16:54.793 --> 16:57.557
I'll get rid of you first, then!

16:58.863 --> 16:59.591
Chibiusa!

16:59.631 --> 17:00.529
Small Lady!

17:00.865 --> 17:02.765
Please...

17:06.838 --> 17:08.066
All right!

17:09.207 --> 17:11.767
How impudent!

17:15.847 --> 17:16.711
Plu!

17:26.524 --> 17:28.992
Flowers are supposed
to bring serenity to humans.

17:29.027 --> 17:31.427
I will not allow using them for evil.

17:31.463 --> 17:33.294
Tuxedo Mask!

17:33.331 --> 17:36.630
Sailor Moon, purify these flowers!

17:36.668 --> 17:38.693
Right!

17:38.737 --> 17:40.728
CRISIS...

17:40.772 --> 17:43.104
MAKE UP!

18:10.769 --> 18:14.330
RAINBOW...

18:14.372 --> 18:15.771
...MOON...

18:15.807 --> 18:19.368
...HEART ACHE!

18:24.115 --> 18:25.446
What!?

18:36.761 --> 18:39.821
My dear flowers...
How dare you!?

18:40.298 --> 18:42.823
Don't assume that you're out of the woods!

18:47.439 --> 18:51.034
You'll regret making me angry.

18:54.479 --> 18:58.210
This Hyper-Telulun will be your opponent.

18:58.249 --> 19:01.343
It's a monster that reacts
only to pure hearts!

19:02.253 --> 19:03.914
This is a scary one!

19:03.955 --> 19:09.552
After taking out the pure heart, it self-destructs
along with the owner of the heart.

19:09.594 --> 19:12.427
I'll leave you to go against it.

19:12.464 --> 19:16.264
I have to deliver this to the professor!

19:16.334 --> 19:17.858
I won't let you!

19:26.044 --> 19:27.033
Drats!!

19:29.781 --> 19:30.748
What are you doing!?

19:31.916 --> 19:33.247
Hey, let go!

19:43.294 --> 19:47.253
STOP IT!

19:53.371 --> 19:55.805
A student handbook from Mugen Academy?

19:55.840 --> 19:57.171
Lulu Teluno?

19:57.208 --> 19:59.142
Telulu!

19:59.177 --> 20:02.635
Mugen Academy is fishy after all...

20:02.680 --> 20:03.977
Plu!

20:04.249 --> 20:05.978
Hang in there, Plu!

20:09.721 --> 20:11.154
Small Lady...

20:11.189 --> 20:12.281
I'm so glad...

20:12.590 --> 20:16.253
I'm sorry.
You got into this mess because of me.

20:16.294 --> 20:18.057
But Plu...

20:18.096 --> 20:22.192
I still believe Hotaru...

20:22.700 --> 20:25.726
Because she's my dear friend.

20:25.770 --> 20:28.603
She's my friend...

20:31.603 --> 20:35.603
