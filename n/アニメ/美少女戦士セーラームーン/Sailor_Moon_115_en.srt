1
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:07,146
Chibiusa, I hope you can
be friends with Hotaru.

2
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:10,281
Don't worry, you're pretty
wonderful yourself.

3
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:12,851
Hey, Daimohn!

4
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:17,296
Big Sister won't allow you to force
your friendship on someone else!

5
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:21,060
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,825
Bye-bye! See you tomorrow!

7
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:25,335
Bye-bye, Chibiusa!

8
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:29,335
Small Lady...

9
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:33,609
Plu!

10
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:37,347
Hello, Small Lady.

11
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:40,342
Plu!

12
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:57,466
Plu, you never come visit to play with me.

13
00:00:57,502 --> 00:00:59,868
I thought that you forgot all about me!

14
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:05,809
Small Lady, in this world,
my name is Setsuna Meioh.

15
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:09,644
In that case, I'm Usagi, too, you know.
Call me Chibiusa!

16
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:12,878
Then, I'll call you Set-chan!

17
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:17,380
You are as you've always been, Small Lady.

18
00:01:18,223 --> 00:01:20,851
It seems that you've made a lot of friends...

19
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:22,985
Is this day and age fun for you?

20
00:01:23,027 --> 00:01:26,554
Yeah, it's fun! Everyone is very nice to me.

21
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:28,065
I see.

22
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:32,195
I'm sure Neo Queen Serenity
sent you to this particular era...

23
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:36,674
...because she wanted you to
make many friends as a normal girl.

24
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:43,242
I'm sure it will all be of help to you in
the future, when you become the Queen.

25
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:44,805
Hey, Plu...

26
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:50,418
I can see you whenever I
want to from now on, right?

27
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:52,581
Really?

28
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:55,356
Yes... I promise you.

29
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:57,522
Okay!

30
00:01:57,562 --> 00:02:01,123
If I don't get home soon,
Mama-Ikuko will be worried.

31
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:02,462
Yes...

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,263
Bye-bye, Plu!

33
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:13,004
"I can see you whenever I
want to from now on, right, Plu?"

34
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:14,341
How cute...

35
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:19,373
But to think that little one is the
Princess who came from the future...

36
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:23,353
Small Lady is the official heir to
the throne of the Silver Millennium.

37
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:28,220
Yeah. I'll at least try to be
careful and not hurt her.

38
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,592
Anyway, we have to find the
Messiah as soon as possible.

39
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,555
The Grail has appeared.

40
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,102
To prevent the silence,
we must make sure that...

41
00:02:38,102 --> 00:02:41,629
...it lands in the hands of
the holy messiah at any cost.

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,241
They are still collecting pure hearts.

43
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:49,212
If that's for them to awaken
the messiah as one of evil...

44
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:53,208
We must work to deal with that.

45
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:55,719
The Messiah of Silence...

46
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:59,246
...must not be born at any cost!

47
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:05,253
I'm sorry... I can't continue
lying to you anymore...

48
00:03:05,296 --> 00:03:07,230
I can't be with you anymore.

49
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:08,960
Please forgive me.

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,465
Why...!? I love you so much...!

51
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:17,238
I'm sorry...
But I just can't forget about her...

52
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:18,633
Impossible!

53
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:20,610
I'm sorry, Hanako...

54
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:25,241
I won't forgive you, Yuu! You have me!
What's this about Hanako!?

55
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:28,309
Who is that woman!?

56
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:31,720
Yes, Mimet here! I'm currently busy...

57
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:34,247
It's me.

58
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:36,251
Oh, Professor!

59
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:39,659
How studious of you to
be so busy right now.

60
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:42,894
So, I can get the name
of the next target, right?

61
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:44,993
Yes, leave it to me.

62
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:47,402
I'm counting on you, Mimet.

63
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:51,033
Yuu Kazama... You are so cute that
this hatred grows a hundred fold!

64
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:54,374
I'll take your pure heart!

65
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:59,279
Oh, no!

66
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:03,818
I want to make this world mine quickly.

67
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:07,814
I want to make this world
beautiful with my own hands.

68
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:10,293
Please wait a little while longer.

69
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:19,298
Pure hearts...
Give me pure hearts quickly...

70
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:23,463
Pure hearts...

71
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,070
This again...

72
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:32,644
What have I been doing?

73
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:36,313
It's always like this after a bad seizure.

74
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:41,419
Hey, Luna-P, don't move.

75
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:53,030
Is Hotaru here?

76
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:55,005
Hotaru is currently resting.

77
00:04:55,506 --> 00:04:58,737
I'm sorry, especially because
you took the time to come here.

78
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,392
Kaori...

79
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:25,893
It seemed like someone was here just now.

80
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,565
That girl who's always here was here.

81
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:29,573
And...?

82
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:32,167
Of course, I had her go back.

83
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,770
Why do you do that without asking!?

84
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:37,545
Hotaru.

85
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:41,050
Don't you think you are
acting a little too selfishly?

86
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:45,249
Because your father is nice, I'm sure
he's letting you do whatever you want.

87
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:50,784
But you, of all people, should know that your
body doesn't let you play around so much!

88
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:54,230
Such a scary face.

89
00:05:56,367 --> 00:06:00,167
I wonder what's wrong with Hotaru...

90
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:02,939
I wonder if she's all right?

91
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:13,349
Chibiusa!

92
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:16,417
Hotaru!

93
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:18,386
Are you all right?

94
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:21,949
I'm glad... I finally found you.

95
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,460
Hotaru, you look like you're in pain.

96
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:29,825
I'm sorry about earlier.

97
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:35,464
Did Kaori say something mean to you?
I was just worried about that...

98
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:36,968
Hotaru!

99
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:38,339
Hotaru!

100
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:40,132
I'm sorry...

101
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:41,543
Hotaru!

102
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,171
Hotaru!!

103
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:44,511
Hotaru!

104
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:45,607
That's...?

105
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,379
Chibiusa...?

106
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:48,942
Chibiusa!

107
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:50,652
What's wrong!?

108
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:51,655
Usagi!

109
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:52,849
Hotaru!

110
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,986
Usagi! Save Hotaru!
Come on, Usagi!

111
00:06:57,628 --> 00:06:58,959
Chibiusa...

112
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:00,987
Hotaru...

113
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:02,966
Hotaru is...!!

114
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:06,629
Chibiusa, calm down.

115
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:07,968
Ami...

116
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:11,463
My mother's hospital is nearby.
Let's take Hotaru there.

117
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:26,721
Hotaru...

118
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:32,760
If I didn't go visit your house,
this wouldn't have happened...

119
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:34,128
It's all my fault...

120
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:36,224
That's not true.

121
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:40,726
You are a dear friend for Hotaru as well...

122
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:43,638
That's why she overexerted
herself to come see you.

123
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:46,768
That's why you should be
at her side now, Chibiusa...

124
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:50,076
That way, Hotaru will be relieved, too.

125
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:52,014
She will be all right!

126
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:11,827
Who did this to my goldfish...?

127
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:12,858
Who...?

128
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:16,032
Oh, my, you're saying strange things...

129
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,901
This is something you did yourself.

130
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:22,037
Please hurry and clean it up.

131
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,449
I don't know about it!

132
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:28,246
Good morning...

133
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,325
What's wrong?

134
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:40,262
Did you get hurt? Are you all right?

135
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,862
What's wrong?

136
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:47,928
She's the one who injured him.
That's so mean to ask what's wrong.

137
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:49,530
She's really scary.

138
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:52,303
She acts all prim and proper at school, too.

139
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:58,144
I...

140
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:01,310
Apparently, I hurt another friend again.

141
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:05,579
But, I really don't remember any of it.

142
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:07,914
It's all right, Hotaru.

143
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:08,948
Calm down.

144
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:10,824
You're not the bad one.

145
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:13,887
You're not bad at all.

146
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:17,833
I'm not able to make any friends!

147
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:21,395
There's a different person
hiding inside of me...

148
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:24,101
The part of me that hurts
the people I care about...

149
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:34,476
Mother will be coming by soon.

150
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,147
I'm glad.

151
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:40,145
It seems like her seizure has been
settled down. It's all right now...

152
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,937
Hotaru.

153
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:31,438
Chibiusa...

154
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:34,940
Hotaru! You shouldn't get up yet!

155
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm fine...

156
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:39,678
You don't hurt anywhere?

157
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:43,686
You're not in pain at all?

158
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:48,318
I'm glad...

159
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:50,350
I'm so glad!

160
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:57,591
Chibiusa...

161
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:04,941
How is it? Feeling any better?

162
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:06,203
Yes.

163
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:08,703
I think you should lie
down for a while longer...

164
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:11,977
I'm all right. It's just one
of my regular seizures...

165
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:14,246
Are you really all right?

166
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:16,048
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

167
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:18,749
My mother, a doctor, will be here soon.

168
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:19,949
I'm sorry...

169
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,122
My family has strictly told me that I can't
have any outside doctors take a look at me.

170
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,391
So I'll go home now.

171
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:31,424
I'll see you later, Chibiusa. Thank you.

172
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:33,961
I'll walk you back.

173
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:39,066
I really thank you very much...

174
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:41,901
Hotaru.

175
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:46,409
The hotcakes that my mom
makes are really yummy.

176
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:49,952
Come visit us next time.
We'll treat you to them!

177
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:50,681
Sure!

178
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:55,691
That's a promise!

179
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,420
Little one!

180
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:01,957
Haruka...

181
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:03,432
Yo!

182
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,799
Where are you going?

183
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:07,428
If you want, I'll give you a ride...

184
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:13,003
Thank you, Haruka...

185
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,442
This is the right road?

186
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:15,946
Yes.

187
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,447
What's your name?

188
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:19,447
My name is Hotaru Tomoe.

189
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:23,120
By any chance, are you
Professor Soichi Tomoe's daughter?

190
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:24,212
Yes...

191
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:25,449
I see...

192
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:29,452
Hotaru...

193
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,120
Can I come visit your place again...?

194
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,623
Would it be bad? Am I just a nuisance?

195
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:37,800
No, you're not a nuisance...

196
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:40,062
I was really happy that you came.

197
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:41,401
Really?

198
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:42,871
Yeah...

199
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:45,068
I'm glad.

200
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:56,753
Yuu Kazama?

201
00:12:57,154 --> 00:13:00,248
You're Yuu Kazama from
"Jump Out Friends," right?

202
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,758
Yeah...

203
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:03,887
It IS you!

204
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:07,625
I'm so thrilled!
I'm a huge fan of yours!

205
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:08,256
I see...

206
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:13,166
Actually, I have a question I want to ask you...

207
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:16,770
I have a friend over there
that is a HUGE fan of yours.

208
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,775
Can we spare a minute of your time?

209
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:20,335
You know...

210
00:13:20,377 --> 00:13:22,971
- Please, just an autograph!!
- W-Wait a minute...

211
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:32,389
Right now... the wind was rustling...

212
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:33,253
Over there...

213
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,486
Is something wrong?

214
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:40,296
I'm sorry... I'm getting a little thirsty.
I'll go buy something over at that park.

215
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:42,322
Okay...

216
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,259
Can it be?

217
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:47,368
Hotaru...
Can you wait here just for a minute?

218
00:13:50,474 --> 00:13:55,935
You know, I'm troubled by things like this.
Where is this friend of yours?

219
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:58,174
Actually, right here...

220
00:13:58,482 --> 00:13:59,949
Are you mocking me?

221
00:14:00,117 --> 00:14:03,109
It's your fault... for finding another woman...

222
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:06,849
You two-timer!

223
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,855
Appear, Daimohn!

224
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:21,198
Utomodachi!

225
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,170
A monster!

226
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:25,471
Let's spread this friendship to the world!

227
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:29,644
I want to be friends with you forever...

228
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,772
H-Hold on...

229
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:34,716
So... give me your pure heart!

230
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,515
Who is it!?

231
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:49,191
You can't win over a man's heart by force.

232
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:55,528
A Sailor Soldier!

233
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:57,233
Just as I thought...

234
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:02,171
Everyone, a Daimohn has appeared
at the park in the fourth block!

235
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:05,176
Got it!

236
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:06,514
All right!

237
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,450
MOON PRISM POWER...

238
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,180
MAKE UP!

239
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:21,488
Utomodachi!

240
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,524
Make her one of your friends, too!

241
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:26,866
Everyone is friendly to each other,
they're all a happy family!

242
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:28,371
Hey, Daimohn!

243
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:29,929
That's enough of that!

244
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:33,808
For love and justice...

245
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:37,041
...an apprentice to a pretty
soldier in a sailor suit!

246
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:39,311
Sailor Chibi Moon!

247
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,716
In the name of the future moon...

248
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:43,947
...I'll punish you!

249
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,581
That was perfect!

250
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:47,954
Idiot! Don't come over to a place like this!

251
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:49,449
Idiot!?

252
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:52,485
You want to be my friend, too?

253
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,520
You silly girl you...

254
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,959
Little girl, jump right in!

255
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:03,437
This is off-limits to kids!

256
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:05,169
I'm a soldier, too!

257
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:09,167
But we seem to be in trouble...
Is it my fault?

258
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:16,681
This again...

259
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:20,115
Don't be shy and be my friend!

260
00:16:20,157 --> 00:16:21,522
Who would!?

261
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:24,520
Hold it right there!

262
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:29,929
A bad guy who hasn't given
up and is after pure hearts!

263
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:34,169
For love and justice!

264
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:36,172
The Sailor Team!

265
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,474
In the name of the moon...

266
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:39,669
...we'll punish you!

267
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,004
More interruptions! Utomodachi!

268
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:44,673
I'm leaving the rest to you!

269
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:46,182
Lady Mimet!!

270
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:56,018
I was going to be a good friend
with you, too! That's it! I quit!

271
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:59,955
You guys...

272
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:03,692
...I hate all of you!

273
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,000
What is that...?

274
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:10,236
Oh, no!

275
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:13,300
Hotaru is over there!

276
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:20,876
Out of the way, out of the way!

277
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:23,645
Out of the way, out of the way!

278
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:31,252
My body doesn't move...

279
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:33,229
What in the world are you...!?

280
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,092
T-This is...!?

281
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,140
Hotaru!

282
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:47,200
Sailor Moon!

283
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:51,774
CRISIS...

284
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:54,215
MAKE UP!

285
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:25,773
RAINBOW...

286
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,374
...MOON...

287
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:31,046
...HEARTACHE!

288
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:45,661
Love-Lovely!!

289
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:00,841
Hotaru...

290
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:02,846
Hotaru! Hold yourself together!

291
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:05,887
Hotaru...

292
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,851
Chibiusa.

293
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:10,121
Are you all right?

294
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:16,623
You shouldn't see me anymore...

295
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:20,867
At this rate, I'm sure I'll hurt you, Chibiusa.

296
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:22,371
Why?

297
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:24,872
I'm sorry...

298
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:26,441
I'm sorry!

299
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:27,636
Hotaru!

300
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:34,846
Sailor Moon.

301
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:35,874
Yes?

302
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,784
It's better to keep the little one...

303
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:39,652
...away from that girl for a while.

304
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,555
What do you mean by that?

305
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:47,329
Just make sure it gets through to her!

306
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:49,097
What does she mean by that!?

307
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:51,430
She's not a bad girl!

308
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:54,096
I wonder if it has something
to do with our enemy...?

309
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:55,331
I don't know...

310
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:04,373
Hotaru.

311
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:06,348
Chibiusa.

312
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:09,614
It would be nice if you could be
friends with that wonderful girl.

313
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:13,851
It's all right, Chibiusa,
we're behind you, too!

314
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:18,855
What's most important is the honest
feeling that you want to be friends with her!

315
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:20,487
Yeah!

316
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,998
All right, I'm going to do my best!

317
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:26,525
Next time, I'll go say hello to her father!

318
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,597
- Hey, I'll go with you.
- Me, too! Me, too!

319
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:37,597
