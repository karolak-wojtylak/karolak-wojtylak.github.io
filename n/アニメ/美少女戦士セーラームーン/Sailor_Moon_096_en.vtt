WEBVTT

00:01.882 --> 00:04.544
Haruka is attractive,
after all...

00:05.285 --> 00:08.652
Mako-chan, you shouldn't!
Haruka is a girl!

00:08.689 --> 00:11.021
What is that dangerous
look in your eyes!?

00:11.058 --> 00:14.653
While we're saying things like that,
the enemy attacks Mako-chan!

00:14.695 --> 00:17.357
F-For now... I, Sailor Moon...

00:17.397 --> 00:20.161
...will punish you in
the name of the moon!

00:40.700 --> 00:43.601
Oh, boy,
I'm so hungry...

00:43.636 --> 00:46.730
And there's another
study group session tonight.

00:46.773 --> 00:48.138
It's all about your guts!

00:48.174 --> 00:52.201
I'll bring roast beef sandwiches
to tonight's study group, too.

00:52.745 --> 00:54.736
Really!? I'm so lucky!

00:54.781 --> 00:59.047
Everyone should have friends
who are talented at cooking!

00:59.385 --> 01:01.615
Mako-chan, I love you!

01:02.121 --> 01:05.113
My cooking isn't about talent.

01:07.059 --> 01:10.290
I just think that
big, boyish girls...

01:10.329 --> 01:13.025
...need to be good at
something like cooking.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.260
So I find myself trying hard.

01:18.738 --> 01:23.004
Even if you couldn't cook,
you're feminine enough, Mako-chan.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.468
Thanks...

01:26.946 --> 01:29.005
- I mean it.
- Really?

01:29.048 --> 01:31.778
Yeah. When I first
met you, Mako-chan...

01:31.818 --> 01:34.548
...I was thinking what
a cute person you were!

01:34.587 --> 01:36.919
You're praising me too much!
But that makes me happy...

01:36.956 --> 01:39.220
...so I'll give you an
extra-large portion, Usagi.

01:41.093 --> 01:42.458
I did it!

01:48.501 --> 01:49.695
Usagi!

01:55.575 --> 01:57.202
Sorry!
Are you all right?

02:07.253 --> 02:09.983
Are you injured!?
Does it hurt anywhere!?

02:11.824 --> 02:13.257
Ow...

02:13.926 --> 02:14.950
Haruka...

02:14.994 --> 02:16.621
Did you hit your head..?

02:16.662 --> 02:19.995
Oh, no, I'm all right.
What about you, Mako-chan?

02:22.468 --> 02:25.665
You, over there.
You're bleeding a bit.

02:27.874 --> 02:28.966
Huh? You're right.

02:29.008 --> 02:30.703
I'm sorry.

02:32.845 --> 02:35.211
No, I'm fine if
it's only this much.

02:36.582 --> 02:39.176
I was just thinking a
little about something...

02:39.685 --> 02:41.983
...so I wasn't paying attention
to what was in front of me.

02:42.021 --> 02:44.216
I have no excuse for this.

02:44.624 --> 02:47.115
No, it's all right...

02:53.299 --> 02:56.166
You're brave, and you look
out for your friends.

03:04.610 --> 03:06.305
I'm sorry to have
surprised you.

03:06.345 --> 03:07.312
No, no...

03:07.346 --> 03:08.711
See ya!

03:13.252 --> 03:15.049
Bye!

03:15.888 --> 03:18.857
Mako-chan, thanks
for covering for... me...

03:25.464 --> 03:27.227
Mako-chan?

03:27.266 --> 03:28.426
You shouldn't!

03:28.467 --> 03:31.994
Even if she's really attractive,
Haruka is a female!

03:33.339 --> 03:35.364
Sheesh...!
W-What are you saying?

03:35.408 --> 03:37.740
Of course!
It's nothing like that!

03:41.514 --> 03:44.415
You're right,
what AM I saying?

03:56.429 --> 03:59.887
We have to find the
messiah at any cost.

04:01.434 --> 04:04.665
The three talismans that are
the key to finding the messiah...

04:04.704 --> 04:07.036
...are sealed
inside pure hearts.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.604
I will make sure they
fall into our hands.

04:11.644 --> 04:14.704
Even if we sacrifice the
owner of that pure heart?

04:15.114 --> 04:19.016
Even if we sacrifice the
owner of that pure heart.

04:19.685 --> 04:21.744
For world peace?

04:21.787 --> 04:24.221
For world peace.

04:24.256 --> 04:26.087
We have little time left.

04:26.125 --> 04:28.355
Silence is soon
approaching us...

04:30.663 --> 04:34.258
You're right. We have
to find the messiah.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.131
At any cost.

04:46.545 --> 04:48.479
The sea is in an uproar.

04:49.181 --> 04:51.917
Yeah, it's around here.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.715
I feel a presence,
but it's not moving yet.

04:56.555 --> 04:59.752
Hey, does anyone know
where Haruka's house is?

05:00.026 --> 05:01.721
No, I haven't asked.

05:01.761 --> 05:04.161
Haruka?
You mean THAT Haruka?

05:05.664 --> 05:07.996
What are you going to
do with her address?

05:08.467 --> 05:11.766
W-Well, I have to
return this to her!

05:22.715 --> 05:25.047
The target has
been confirmed.

05:35.361 --> 05:36.658
W-Wait!

05:36.695 --> 05:38.754
If I don't have that, I don't
have an excuse to see Haruka!

05:38.798 --> 05:40.265
Excuse...?

05:41.700 --> 05:43.565
Wait!

05:50.843 --> 05:52.401
Where did it fall...?

05:54.880 --> 05:56.780
It's not here...

05:58.918 --> 06:00.579
It's there!

06:08.194 --> 06:09.786
Just a bit more!

06:28.047 --> 06:29.742
Got it!

06:35.921 --> 06:38.014
SCAR...

06:40.526 --> 06:42.517
W-W-W-What is that!?

06:42.561 --> 06:44.654
SCAR...

06:46.298 --> 06:49.825
I will take your
pure heart, SCAR!

06:51.237 --> 06:53.000
- That's...!
- A Daimohn!

06:53.038 --> 06:54.733
- Mako-cha--
- Let's transform!

06:54.773 --> 06:55.797
Oh, sure thing.

06:57.776 --> 07:02.907
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

07:34.213 --> 07:38.673
MERCURY STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

07:54.033 --> 07:54.829
SCAR...

07:58.938 --> 08:03.034
SHINE AQUA ILLUSION!

08:07.079 --> 08:07.943
SCAR!

08:08.547 --> 08:11.345
What are you doing
so early in the morning!?

08:11.383 --> 08:13.943
Get away from that girl!

08:15.187 --> 08:17.382
I'm already interrupted.

08:17.423 --> 08:19.516
For now, retreat, Scar!

08:20.759 --> 08:21.726
SCAR!

08:24.263 --> 08:25.389
It's flying!?

08:29.935 --> 08:32.529
W-What in the
world is that?

08:37.810 --> 08:40.472
That girl is the
target this time.

08:40.512 --> 08:43.675
I couldn't tell if she was
the owner of a talisman.

08:44.016 --> 08:47.452
Sailor Moon sure did
something unnecessary.

08:47.920 --> 08:52.380
Why don't we tell them
everything and fight together?

08:53.192 --> 08:55.683
Silence is approaching.

08:55.728 --> 08:59.528
To stop it, we must
sacrifice someone.

08:59.565 --> 09:01.692
Can they do that?

09:01.734 --> 09:03.861
So, what are
we going to do?

09:03.902 --> 09:06.200
They'll be after
her again.

09:06.238 --> 09:08.399
We have to keep an eye
on her for a while.

09:37.436 --> 09:39.461
Mako-chan! Let's go home!

09:39.505 --> 09:41.871
Oh? Ms. Kino went home already.

09:44.243 --> 09:47.735
That's funny...
Where did it go?

09:47.780 --> 09:49.179
Mako-chan!

09:50.082 --> 09:52.983
What are you doing here
all by yourself?

09:53.018 --> 09:54.212
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:54.253 --> 09:56.517
Actually, I haven't
found Haruka's scarf...

09:56.555 --> 09:58.420
...since I lost it
here this morning.

09:59.191 --> 10:02.422
Y-You know, Mako-chan, I told
you this yesterday, too...

10:02.461 --> 10:04.656
I-I've been saying
it's nothing like that.

10:04.697 --> 10:06.289
Are you sure?

10:06.332 --> 10:08.323
I'm sure!

10:10.002 --> 10:13.631
Hi. I'm glad I bumped
into you again today.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.964
Haruka...

10:16.008 --> 10:17.839
I have something to ask you.

10:17.876 --> 10:19.901
Do you mind joining me?

10:19.945 --> 10:22.778
Do you mean me?
S-Sure!

10:23.382 --> 10:27.216
Mako-chan, don't you think
there's a slight problem here?

10:27.252 --> 10:30.517
What, girls can't go
on a drive together?

10:31.523 --> 10:34.981
I wasn't saying that...

10:35.027 --> 10:36.324
Then it's all right.

10:36.362 --> 10:38.592
I'll borrow your
friend for a bit.

10:38.630 --> 10:40.461
You'll come with me, right?

10:40.499 --> 10:41.830
S-Sure!

10:41.867 --> 10:43.892
M-Mako-chan?

10:45.270 --> 10:47.465
I don't care about
this anymore...

10:51.410 --> 10:54.038
That's Michiru.
She's in the same grade as I.

10:54.079 --> 10:55.706
I believe we've
met once before.

10:55.748 --> 10:57.079
Nice to meet you.

10:57.116 --> 11:02.144
I-I see... Same grade?
How old are you two?

11:02.788 --> 11:04.756
We're in tenth grade.

11:04.790 --> 11:08.886
Tenth grade? Then is it all
right for you to drive a car?

11:09.561 --> 11:11.290
Is it all right?

11:11.330 --> 11:16.063
Let's see... I-I got
a license overseas.

11:19.405 --> 11:20.997
So she says.

11:22.608 --> 11:25.509
Those are pretty ear rings.
They look good on you.

11:26.612 --> 11:28.603
Do you think so...?

11:28.981 --> 11:31.279
Was it bad for us to
force you like this?

11:31.316 --> 11:33.375
No, not at all!

11:34.353 --> 11:38.187
So, what did you want to ask me?

11:38.557 --> 11:41.492
I want to be better
friends with you...

11:48.100 --> 11:49.897
A DATE!?

11:49.935 --> 11:51.493
Y-Yeah...

11:51.537 --> 11:54.335
But it's with a woman.

11:54.373 --> 11:55.863
A woman?

11:55.908 --> 11:57.466
This is a problem...

11:57.509 --> 11:59.977
Did Mako-chan's
preferences change?

12:00.012 --> 12:01.377
It's not that!

12:01.413 --> 12:04.211
And it was Haruka
she went off with!

12:04.783 --> 12:07.445
I can't laugh that one off.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.385
No matter how
attractive she is...

12:09.421 --> 12:12.219
...I can't believe that
she's chasing after women.

12:12.257 --> 12:13.554
It's not that!

12:13.592 --> 12:17.050
But, Rei, you have THIS, too!

12:18.564 --> 12:21.465
Don't pull out other people's
books without their permission!

12:22.534 --> 12:24.365
That's not the problem!

12:27.739 --> 12:30.606
W-We shouldn't leave
Mako-chan alone.

12:30.642 --> 12:34.544
The enemy is after Mako-chan's
pure heart this time!

12:34.880 --> 12:36.313
Y-Yeah...

12:44.656 --> 12:46.851
I'm pretty close...
I'm at Kaiouzu Park.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.689
We'll be right there.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.958
I'm all right. If an enemy
comes, I'll defeat it.

12:52.364 --> 12:55.128
Please, let me do what
I want for today.

13:01.473 --> 13:05.307
- Mako-chan! Mako-chan!
- Don't give up!

13:05.344 --> 13:08.575
That's right! There are plenty of
good-looking guys in the world!

13:08.614 --> 13:10.343
Sheesh, no wisn't
the time for--

13:10.382 --> 13:11.781
But this is a
big problem, too!

13:11.817 --> 13:14.012
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
problem for Mako-chan!

13:14.052 --> 13:17.317
It's all right. It's really
nothing like that.

13:18.724 --> 13:20.123
I don't know how
to say this...

13:20.158 --> 13:22.558
You know how Haruka
is attractive, right?

13:22.594 --> 13:24.926
I just look up to someone
that attractive...

13:31.436 --> 13:32.835
SCAR!

13:33.305 --> 13:34.203
SCAR!

13:34.239 --> 13:35.263
SCAR!

13:42.781 --> 13:43.941
- Mako-chan!
- Mako-chan!

13:43.982 --> 13:48.510
Your pure heart that looks
up to your ideal woman!

13:48.554 --> 13:49.646
This time, I will...

13:52.624 --> 13:53.591
Haruka!

13:53.625 --> 13:56.150
You monster!
Let go of Mako-chan!

13:56.194 --> 13:59.163
You can't!
Run, both of you! Hurry!

13:59.932 --> 14:02.196
It's dangerous
to throw rocks!

14:06.471 --> 14:07.836
Haruka! Michiru!

14:09.341 --> 14:10.865
The interruptions
have disappeared.

14:10.909 --> 14:13.878
Scar, take the pure
heart from that girl!

14:17.449 --> 14:18.973
SCAR!

14:29.962 --> 14:31.725
Right according to plan.

14:31.763 --> 14:34.891
Yeah... I feel sorry for her,
but we have to do this.

14:53.251 --> 14:53.979
SCAR!

14:54.019 --> 14:55.452
You're...!

14:56.755 --> 15:01.021
Sorry... We need the
talisman at any cost.

15:02.494 --> 15:05.520
Damn you!
Scar! Get rid of them!

15:08.767 --> 15:09.631
SCAR!

15:12.838 --> 15:13.668
SCAR!

15:13.705 --> 15:15.002
I won't let you have
the pure heart!

15:15.040 --> 15:18.737
So, that's why they've
been hiding until now?

15:20.078 --> 15:22.308
They didn't feel
anything at all...

15:22.347 --> 15:25.145
...as they watched Haruka
and Michiru get beaten up!?

15:25.283 --> 15:26.614
That's the end!

15:26.652 --> 15:27.448
SCAR?

15:27.953 --> 15:31.753
The villain that snatches
away a pure maiden's heart!

15:31.790 --> 15:34.384
As a pretty soldier,
I can't forgive you!

15:36.094 --> 15:39.655
In the name ofthe moon,
I punish you!

15:41.033 --> 15:43.058
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

15:43.101 --> 15:45.001
BURNING MANDALA!

15:46.271 --> 15:47.203
SCAR!

15:51.510 --> 15:52.340
SCAR!

15:52.577 --> 15:54.169
This isn't a talisman, either.

15:54.212 --> 15:55.577
Wait!

15:55.881 --> 15:58.816
Please, return
this girl's heart!

16:01.687 --> 16:03.780
Hurry and return it to her.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.247
Hurry, Sailor Moon!

16:08.894 --> 16:11.021
They seem to be
having a tough fight.

16:11.063 --> 16:13.190
They're pathetic.

16:19.304 --> 16:23.104
DEEP SUBMERGE!

16:26.845 --> 16:28.574
SCAR!

16:31.583 --> 16:33.016
Are you all right?

16:33.051 --> 16:34.643
Yeah. Thanks.

16:34.686 --> 16:39.089
- Rest for today.
- No, I can't do that...

16:39.391 --> 16:43.885
JUPITER STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

17:00.846 --> 17:01.574
SCAR!

17:02.814 --> 17:06.215
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

17:09.454 --> 17:10.682
Jupiter!

17:10.722 --> 17:12.417
Now, Sailor Moon!

17:32.677 --> 17:39.981
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

17:44.356 --> 17:48.156
SCAR!

17:50.595 --> 17:53.996
LOVELY!

18:01.106 --> 18:04.007
Wait! I don't know
what you mean by this...

18:04.042 --> 18:08.536
...but you always appear like thieves
and try to steal the pure hearts!

18:08.580 --> 18:11.276
You guys are just
like the Daimohn!

18:11.783 --> 18:13.273
What if that's the case?

18:13.318 --> 18:14.546
I can't forgive you,
especially today.

18:14.586 --> 18:17.111
I'll straighten out that
demented mentality of yours!

18:26.765 --> 18:27.823
Jupiter!

18:29.267 --> 18:30.894
Jupiter!

18:35.974 --> 18:39.205
You're being immature.
You should hold back a little.

18:39.811 --> 18:41.472
Uranus?

18:41.513 --> 18:44.414
She's powerful.

18:46.718 --> 18:48.049
This is...

18:49.120 --> 18:50.815
Why is it here?

18:50.922 --> 18:52.753
Haruka and
Michiru are here!

18:54.926 --> 18:57.190
Haruka! Haruka!

18:57.229 --> 18:59.754
Haruka! Haruka!

19:02.000 --> 19:04.764
Haruka! I'm so glad...

19:05.704 --> 19:07.501
Oh... M-Mako-chan.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.568
What about that monster?

19:11.610 --> 19:15.410
She says the Sailor Soldiers
came and defeated it.

19:15.447 --> 19:18.382
- I see...
- Haruka! I'm so glad!

19:24.823 --> 19:26.347
I'm sorry...

19:26.691 --> 19:29.660
It's because you
were with me...

19:32.330 --> 19:34.628
Haruka, you
injured your hand!

19:35.100 --> 19:37.068
Oh, you're right...

19:38.503 --> 19:40.767
Huh? This is...

19:40.805 --> 19:42.272
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:42.307 --> 19:45.504
I intended to return
this scarf to you.

19:51.983 --> 19:55.384
Haruka is
wonderful after all...

19:55.887 --> 20:02.952
I hope I can be a wonderful
woman like her someday.

20:04.729 --> 20:08.028
Hey, hey, what do you think
of Mako-chan's attitude?

20:08.066 --> 20:09.897
That looks rather serious.

20:09.935 --> 20:11.197
I don't know...

20:11.236 --> 20:14.672
Maybe it's like usual, and she
just resembled that other guy.

20:14.706 --> 20:16.674
But isn't it a little bad?

20:16.708 --> 20:18.039
Yeah, it's bad, it's bad.

20:18.076 --> 20:19.737
Mako-chan?

20:22.737 --> 20:26.737
