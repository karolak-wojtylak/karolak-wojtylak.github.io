1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,734
Silence is approaching.

2
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:06,704
Quietly, but surely...

3
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:09,468
Is this world really going to disappear!?

4
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:13,808
Hey, you over there who's cheering
"All right! There will be no more school!"

5
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:16,040
It's not time to be so easygoing like that!

6
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:20,313
I, Sailor Moon will punish you
in the name of the moon!

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,900
Y-You're the Messiah?!

8
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:48,433
Please! Save everyone!

9
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:07,719
- And so...
- Yeah.

10
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:10,061
This goes over here and does this.

11
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:10,997
Understand?

12
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:12,091
Nope.

13
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:16,699
The ominous dream
gets stronger and stronger...

14
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,835
But, what in the world
is that girl...!?

15
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:32,886
- Is Usagi here?
- Chibiusa.

16
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:34,013
This is unusual.

17
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:37,184
Hey! I told you not
to come here to play!

18
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:38,784
Come on, Usagi.

19
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:42,854
I'm sorry to bother you right in the middle
of your preparation for entrance exams.

20
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:45,628
But I have a favor to ask
of my dear sister Usagi...

21
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:49,469
"Dear sister Usagi"...!?

22
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:51,468
Actually, it's this.

23
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,305
The opening of a brand new planetarium?

24
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:57,039
Chibiusa, you want to
go to the planetarium?

25
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,673
Yeah! It'll be a learning experience, too.

26
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:04,982
I see... This week, it will be narrated
by that cute boy DJ, Thomas Harris...

27
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:08,982
In any case, it's close to here,
so I thought I could invite Hotaru...

28
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:11,358
I see.

29
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:12,382
I get it...

30
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:15,955
All right, let's all go tomorrow.

31
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:17,056
Thanks!

32
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:23,702
But why is Haruka's group
keeping an eye on Hotaru...?

33
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:33,580
The enemy is still collecting pure hearts.

34
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:38,712
Perhaps Hotaru has a special
pure heart or something...

35
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:41,149
I see, that's possible.

36
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,714
Hotaru is a kind girl, too...

37
00:02:48,997 --> 00:02:50,589
That's impossible...

38
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:53,399
I can't wait for tomorrow!

39
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:55,699
And can I count on you for
the admission fees, too?

40
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:56,727
For the both of us?

41
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:01,698
So she says...

42
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:06,704
Usagi, the mother really has to
take care of things like that.

43
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,714
"Mother?"

44
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:11,952
A mother who takes
good care of her daughter...

45
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:13,955
I can't possibly do that!

46
00:03:14,757 --> 00:03:18,386
- Mother...
- I haven't given birth to you yet!

47
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:21,590
It's so noble of you to
start her education now...

48
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,656
Well... I would like to take
care of a cute girl like her!

49
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,998
I'll give her away, yeah,
you can have her!

50
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:31,233
- Well, I'm no match against her real mom!
- You can have her if you want!

51
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,474
Lately, that dream where
the world falls to ruin...

52
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:40,448
It's getting stronger than ever before.

53
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:44,410
We must find the Messiah
as soon as possible...

54
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:49,982
If they awaken the user of the Grail
as the evil Messiah of Silence...

55
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:51,893
Hotaru Tomoe...

56
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,792
She possesses strange powers.

57
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,593
We must determine what
she really is quickly!

58
00:03:56,632 --> 00:04:00,568
In any case, she's the only
daughter of Professor Tomoe...

59
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:02,502
...whom we've been targeting as
a suspected Death Busters member!

60
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:06,965
That girl who is standing in the
light of the grail in my dream...

61
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:11,002
I think I'm slowly starting to see her figure.

62
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:15,376
She is holding a long weapon
of some sort in her hands...

63
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:18,545
T-That means...

64
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:20,020
The scythe of silence...

65
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:22,017
The Silence Glaive.

66
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:24,618
A-Are you sure about that?

67
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,025
I'm not really sure, but...

68
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:27,323
It can't be!

69
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:31,389
Could the Messiah of Silence
be that soldier of ruin...

70
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:34,027
...the one guarded by
the planet of destruction...!?

71
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,467
If that's the case, we may not be
able to do anything at all anymore.

72
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:40,737
The world will shortly fall to ruins...

73
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:41,834
No...

74
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:45,711
Even if that soldier of ruin were
to be reincarnated into this era...

75
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:49,046
...we still have a chance if we
strike before she awakens.

76
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:52,110
This planet will not be destroyed!

77
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:54,179
I will never give up!

78
00:04:54,223 --> 00:04:59,058
That's right. We shouldn't give up.
In order to protect this planet.

79
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,991
It's almost time...

80
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:09,066
Soon, I will awaken.

81
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:15,571
That time will be when what you wish for...

82
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:19,571
...silence... will cover this planet.

83
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:26,080
We were not mistaken to choose
you as the Messiah of Silence.

84
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:32,085
I am the only one who
can fulfill your wishes...

85
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:35,894
If you wish for me to awaken sooner...

86
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:40,732
...seek pure hearts that become
energy for my awakening.

87
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:48,137
Be of use to me!

88
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:51,978
Try to make me happier!

89
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:52,639
Yes!

90
00:05:56,685 --> 00:06:00,143
Welcome to the Countdown50!
I'm Thomas Harris.

91
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:02,554
And now, I'll go over
the top ten hits of the week.

92
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:06,527
In tenth place is a song
that was #30 last week.

93
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:09,258
- Thomas... I'll be there to see you soon!
- The artist's album is increasing in sales, too.

94
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,459
- Wait for me!
- All right, let's start with this song.

95
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,491
Let's get it on!

96
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,530
Yes? Oh, Professor!

97
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,905
Yes, it's perfect!

98
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:22,968
Do you like the stars, Professor?

99
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,672
Oh, I'm glad!

100
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:28,671
Yes. This time, I'm sure to...
Leave it to me.

101
00:06:30,018 --> 00:06:33,886
I see... You're the only hope, Mimet...

102
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:37,186
Stars, huh...?

103
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:43,129
The stars know all...
was something someone said before...

104
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,626
Wish upon a star... was something else...

105
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,371
Wait, Tomomi!

106
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,042
You know, let's work on
today's homework together!

107
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:15,119
Hotaru!

108
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:17,625
Chibiusa!

109
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,801
You were... waiting for me?

110
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:21,734
Yeah!

111
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,532
You know...

112
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:25,233
There's a new planetarium
that opened up nearby.

113
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:26,638
I thought about going with you.

114
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,368
That sounds fun...

115
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:30,639
Then, let's go right now!

116
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:32,273
Right now...?

117
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:33,872
I'm on my way back home from school...

118
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:36,383
I should ask Papa first
whether or not I can go.

119
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:40,110
If you do that, the show
will begin! Come on...

120
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:40,985
But...

121
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:44,459
Girls of this day and age
shouldn't say things like that!

122
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:45,858
Usagi!

123
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:48,829
Hotaru, if you can't do something on
your way back home from school...

124
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:50,923
...without asking your parents,
you won't grow up to be a good adult!

125
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:51,796
Hey, now...

126
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,496
Actually, straying on the way home isn't
a good thing, but we don't have time today...

127
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,767
If we aren't bothering you, let's go.

128
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,266
Bothering? Not at all...

129
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,771
Please? I'll apologize to your dad with you.

130
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:08,848
Chibiusa...

131
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:11,079
All right... Shall we go, then?

132
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,780
I'm so glad!

133
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:14,789
If that's the case, let's hurry!

134
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:19,957
And Andromeda, born from
arrogant and selfish parents...

135
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:23,988
...had both arms and
both legs chained together...

136
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:28,298
...and with her freedom gone she was
sacrificed to a monster in the sea.

137
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:32,064
The pain continued until
Perseus came to rescue her.

138
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,004
As you may well know...

139
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:40,709
...there are many more sad tales
concerning the girls in the stars.

140
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:48,851
So she is here.

141
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,326
The target is probably the narrator.

142
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,887
But even Usagi's group
is here with that girl.

143
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:58,860
This might work out even better for us...

144
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,394
This is our chance to see
what Hotaru Tomoe really is.

145
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:08,073
The giant scorpion let loose by the goddess
of the earth is a summer constellation.

146
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,137
- Orion shows himself only in...
- Thomas...

147
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:16,978
You're almost mine.

148
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,082
Setsuna?

149
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:02,759
Why are you here, Setsuna...?

150
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:04,857
Did an enemy appear?

151
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,267
Or are you still keeping an eye on Hotaru?

152
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:12,867
Please, tell us. What are you
guys planning to do, Setsuna?

153
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:16,400
I'm sure we can help you, too.

154
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:22,282
I believe that we can no longer
fight without telling you the truth.

155
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:26,285
Uranus, Neptune, and I have an objective...

156
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:28,551
...to prevent the arrival of
the approaching silence...

157
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:32,649
Our enemy is an intruder from another
dimension in outer space, the Death Busters.

158
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,821
Death Busters?

159
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:37,559
What is that "silence?"

160
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,565
It's the destruction of the world...

161
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:42,797
I'm sure that Sailor Mars,
you have already...

162
00:10:42,838 --> 00:10:44,772
...seen it in the form
of a foretelling dream...?

163
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:47,270
Is that true?

164
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:48,276
- Rei!
- Rei!

165
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:51,103
I wasn't sure about it...

166
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:54,673
It's just that ever since those monsters
called Daimohns started to appear...

167
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:59,050
I've been seeing horrible
dreams over and over.

168
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:03,953
That's the silence we need to prevent...

169
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:06,290
...the image of Earth's destruction.

170
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:08,319
Earth's destruction?

171
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:15,298
Please place your hearts inside the
light from the orb at the tip of this rod.

172
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:20,998
You should be able to see the image
that Mars has been dreaming about.

173
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:36,154
T-This...

174
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,660
This can't be...

175
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:44,360
This is...

176
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,331
This is silence...?

177
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:56,109
If the enemy,
the Messiah of Silence, awakens...

178
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:59,341
...this will become reality.

179
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:03,143
The Messiah of Silence...?

180
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:08,579
She is the final soldier
that should not be awakened...

181
00:12:08,623 --> 00:12:15,028
The guide to death who appears at the time of
destruction, and returns everything to nothing.

182
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:22,432
Messiah of Silence...

183
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,732
What in the world...

184
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:28,475
Soon, she will reveal to
us what she really is.

185
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:48,192
Uchoten!

186
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:50,062
In your place...

187
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:52,931
A wish upon a star!

188
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:03,677
A wish upon a star!

189
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:07,742
Everyone! Get down!

190
00:13:13,922 --> 00:13:15,753
A m-monster!

191
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,394
Well done, Uchoten.

192
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:23,894
It really is much!

193
00:13:23,932 --> 00:13:25,263
Uchoten!

194
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:31,129
I'll get rid of the crowd,
so you get Thomas' pure heart...

195
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:32,503
Uchoten!

196
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,598
But, before that...

197
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:36,201
Thomas, can I have your autograph?

198
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:38,445
How scary...

199
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,108
Fine, then!

200
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:46,382
CHARM...

201
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:47,786
...BUSTER!

202
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:54,218
Hotaru, are you all right?

203
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:55,559
Y-Yes.

204
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:58,792
Hotaru!

205
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:01,334
I-It's all right.

206
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,803
It's one of those seizures.
I'll be fine in a moment.

207
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:06,003
We have to hurry to the hospital!

208
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,565
Wait here!

209
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:08,940
I'll transform, and...

210
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:09,773
Wait.

211
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:10,869
Uranus!

212
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:12,743
See how she fares for a bit longer.

213
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:14,510
But, Hotaru...

214
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:15,846
Hold it right there!

215
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:18,047
Stars that twinkle in the sky!

216
00:14:18,086 --> 00:14:20,384
Sharing your feelings
with the bright stars!

217
00:14:20,422 --> 00:14:22,754
A planetarium is a place full of dreams!

218
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,021
Someone who wrecks
such a place of dreams...

219
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,358
We, the Sailor Team...

220
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:32,060
...will punish you in
the name of the moon!

221
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,028
Well, no matter what you say...

222
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:36,765
...there's no way those girls
will just sit quietly and watch.

223
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:37,396
Yes.

224
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:40,306
Sheesh! Why do you
always get in my way!?

225
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:41,205
Uchoten!

226
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:42,038
Yes?

227
00:14:42,077 --> 00:14:45,979
Save the pure heart for later.
First, get rid of those that get in our way!

228
00:14:46,014 --> 00:14:46,844
Yes!

229
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:49,042
I'm trusting you to take care of the rest!

230
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:50,278
Y-Yes!

231
00:14:50,318 --> 00:14:52,047
Then, everyone, with me...

232
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:57,048
A wish upon a star!

233
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:02,394
A wish upon a star!

234
00:15:06,468 --> 00:15:07,799
Uchoten!

235
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:09,701
Look up at the night sky!

236
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:14,705
Hang in there, Hotaru!

237
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,275
We can't move around like this.

238
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:18,677
We have to do something.

239
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:20,578
Due to popular demand...

240
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:21,604
A wish upon--

241
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:25,618
A rose?!

242
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:27,983
That's enough, Daimohn.

243
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:31,617
I have sealed away the
evil star that tortures people.

244
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:33,626
You can't wish anymore!

245
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:37,724
Thanks for the cheers...

246
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:39,494
Answering your requests...

247
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:42,628
A wish upon a star!

248
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,136
Everyone, get out of the way!

249
00:15:46,741 --> 00:15:48,436
It looks like it got worse than before.

250
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:50,774
Duck, Venus!

251
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:53,246
Hotaru! Duck!

252
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,723
Just as we thought!

253
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,726
Hotaru!

254
00:16:07,428 --> 00:16:08,554
What...!?

255
00:16:08,596 --> 00:16:09,494
Can it be...?

256
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:11,993
Hotaru...

257
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,990
I-Impossible...

258
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:16,997
A Sailor Soldier...!?

259
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:21,000
Y-You are...!

260
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:24,872
W-What...!?

261
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:27,507
M-My body...

262
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:29,441
...doesn't move!

263
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:31,008
Now, Sailor Moon!

264
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:35,213
CRISIS...

265
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:37,656
MAKE UP!

266
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,782
RAINBOW...

267
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:10,222
...MOON...

268
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:13,091
...HEARTACHE!

269
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:29,035
Love-Lovely!

270
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:46,826
WORLD...

271
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:48,886
...SHAKING!

272
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:56,797
DEEP...

273
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:58,066
...SUBMERGE!

274
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:03,338
DEAD SCREAM...

275
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:07,437
You can't!

276
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,984
STOP!

277
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:20,686
Chibiusa!!

278
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,035
Sailor Moon!

279
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:31,095
What are you doing!?

280
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:32,265
Get out of the way.

281
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:33,569
W-What!?

282
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:37,637
She is the one guarded by Saturn,
the planet of destruction...

283
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,874
...the solder of ruin, Sailor Saturn.

284
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:42,178
When Sailor Saturn awakens...

285
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:44,309
...the world is about to end.

286
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:50,250
Get out of the way!
You don't know the horror of silence!

287
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:53,354
Unless we kill that girl,
Saturn will awaken.

288
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:56,261
If Saturn awakens,
it means the end of this planet!!

289
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:59,690
You can't!
You can't just kill this girl!!

290
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:01,998
Even if Saturn is the soldier of ruin...

291
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:06,268
...nobody has the right to
kill Hotaru to seal her away!!

292
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:10,775
You're too cruel trying to kill Hotaru!
There must be some otherway!

293
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:14,578
I knew you guys would say that...

294
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:15,513
But...

295
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,075
There is no other way
to save this world.

296
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,579
No matter what happens,
we can't let Sailor Saturn awaken.

297
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:25,183
That is the destiny of the stars.

298
00:19:25,226 --> 00:19:26,784
Hotaru!

299
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:29,686
Hotaru!

300
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,289
Where did she...!?

301
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,462
Oh, no!

302
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:45,478
I was worried.

303
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:49,481
A bad girl, not to come straight home...

304
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:53,884
Yes, that is correct, Pharaoh Ninty.

305
00:19:56,557 --> 00:20:02,291
Yes, that girl is Sailor Saturn,
guarded by the planet of destruction.

306
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:07,997
There can't be a better candidate
for the Messiah of Silence!

307
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:14,997
