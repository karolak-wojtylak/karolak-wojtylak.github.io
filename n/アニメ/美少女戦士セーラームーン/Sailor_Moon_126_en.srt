1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,031
Haruka, Michiru...
please undo your transformations!

2
00:00:05,904 --> 00:00:09,169
Will we never understand each other?

3
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:11,767
We can't feel each other's warmth?

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,837
Are we going to bicker and
stay enemies until the end?

5
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:20,250
Uranus, Neptune...
undo your transformations!

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
Hotaru!!

7
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,371
Sailor Moon!

8
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,545
Sailor Moon!

9
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,408
Sailor Moon! Hang in there!

10
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:06,547
- Are you all right?
- Hold onto my shoulder...

11
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,077
Chibiusa...!

12
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:34,174
Usagi... Mamo-chan...

13
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:35,377
I'm so glad...

14
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:38,654
Hotaru... Where's Hotaru?

15
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:44,719
You're kidding...
you're kidding, right?

16
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,662
Hotaru came and visited me!

17
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:51,330
In my dream... she said thanks...

18
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:55,432
Chibiusa...

19
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:58,066
It's all right.
I'm sure she is alive.

20
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:00,269
Mamo-chan...

21
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,368
That's right!

22
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:05,040
Sailor Moon risked her life
to protect Hotaru back there!

23
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:09,210
I'm sure... that she's safe
somewhere out there.

24
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:11,777
Yeah, I know.
It's all right...

25
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:13,790
I won't cry anymore.

26
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:16,486
Usagi, you did your best, right?

27
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:17,550
Chibiusa...!

28
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:22,292
Chibiusa!

29
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,501
Good morning!

30
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,162
- Good morning!
- Now, hurry!

31
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:28,728
The bus is going to leave!

32
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:30,797
Chibiusa!

33
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:35,805
- I'll be going now!
- Hurry, hurry!

34
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,012
Usagi...

35
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:45,177
She's really trying too hard...

36
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:48,919
In reality, she's worried
sick about Hotaru...

37
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:51,419
Chibiusa is caring
about others, too.

38
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:55,022
Even if she cried over it,
all it would do is trouble you, Usagi.

39
00:03:55,065 --> 00:04:00,162
We can't find Sailor Pluto's
whereabouts, nor Hotaru's...

40
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:04,195
Mina, Makoto, and the others are
doing their best to look for them!

41
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,230
But...

42
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:07,675
No, I won't give up...

43
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:12,708
Back then, I did feel Hotaru's warmth...

44
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:15,676
I still remember it clearly...

45
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:19,320
We'll see her again...
I'm sure of it!

46
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:31,030
I'll see you again, I'm sure...

47
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:49,615
You look so picturesque.

48
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:53,111
Perhaps it would be nice for the three of
us to live peacefully like this as a family.

49
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:54,680
Come on...!

50
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:58,050
Well, it's time.

51
00:04:58,094 --> 00:04:59,857
Yes.

52
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:01,727
It's farewell, baby...

53
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,197
Ryouichi and Masako Hidaka,
please come to window 4...

54
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:47,267
Really, what a plump and cute baby!

55
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:50,542
I'm sure she'll grow up to
be a precocious little girl!

56
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:56,782
You have a visitor...

57
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,691
Mr. Tomoe.

58
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:25,712
Hotaru...

59
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,584
Mr. Soichi Tomoe's
amnesia is rather serious...

60
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:37,088
He has a severe mental trauma
on top of his head injuries...

61
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:42,858
Fortunately, he's recovering well, so he won't
face any problems returning to society...

62
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:48,360
But, most of his memory from the past
few years only remains in fragments.

63
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:54,610
Hm, what's wrong?

64
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:57,779
What's wrong?

65
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:00,612
It's strange...
It feels so lonely...

66
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:03,275
Let's go...

67
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,622
Before we leave that town,
we have one more thing to do.

68
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:30,711
Chibiusa!

69
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,573
What's wrong?
You don't look too cheerful.

70
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:37,211
No, I'm fine and full of energy!

71
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:39,050
Hey, let's go!

72
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,820
Go on ahead!
I'll catch right up with you!

73
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,986
Sure!

74
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:01,606
Plu...?

75
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,236
Plu!!

76
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:06,211
You did very well.

77
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:08,274
I want to hold you
and congratulate you.

78
00:08:08,318 --> 00:08:11,685
But, I no longer have
a physical body in this world.

79
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:14,918
Plu! Don't say that, come back...

80
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:19,588
Hotaru isn't here, either...
I'm all alone now!

81
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:23,395
That is not true.
You have wonderful friends.

82
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,268
And, Sailor Saturn...

83
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:30,265
Hotaru... is she all right?
Is she alive!?

84
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:36,768
Within Hotaru, two personalities resided.
Sailor Saturn and...

85
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:39,646
...Mistress Nine of the Death Busters.

86
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:45,018
However, Hotaru was able to annihilate
Mistress Nine using Sailor Moon's help...

87
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:54,121
She has been reincarnated on this beautiful
planet and is about to relive a new life.

88
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:56,092
Don't go...!!

89
00:08:57,233 --> 00:09:02,034
I will see you once again... someday.
My Small Lady... take care...

90
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:04,597
Don't go, Plu!!

91
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,610
Oh, is this yours?

92
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:16,615
Yes... I'm sorry to trouble you.

93
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:19,916
Hotaru's...

94
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:22,322
...dad...

95
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,550
Here.

96
00:09:56,593 --> 00:09:57,821
T-Thank you...

97
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:01,229
Whoa there...

98
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:03,824
She likes you.

99
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:14,739
Isn't she cute?
She's my daughter.

100
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:15,573
What's her name?

101
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:17,637
Oh, her name is Hotaru.

102
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,944
Right, Hotaru?

103
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:22,850
Hotaru...

104
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:30,353
She has been reincarnated on this beautiful
planet and is about to relive a new life.

105
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:32,857
Mr. Tomoe!

106
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:38,663
Um...

107
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,270
I hope the baby stays healthy!

108
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:43,033
Yeah!

109
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:45,040
Bye-bye!

110
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:49,043
Hotaru...

111
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:54,945
I'm happy for you, Hotaru.

112
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,012
I'll see you again, right?

113
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,783
Until then...

114
00:10:59,822 --> 00:11:01,050
Bye-bye...

115
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:25,775
No good.

116
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:28,943
The other dimension
is completely gone.

117
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:30,850
There isn't even a trace of it.

118
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:33,822
I thought we could get some clue...

119
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,651
Hey, how was it?

120
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:40,254
Nothing. It's just a normal
building after detonation.

121
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:41,558
Same here.

122
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:46,558
We walked all around town,
but we had no clues concerning Hotaru.

123
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:50,335
Hey, why are you depressed!?

124
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:55,233
Usagi, you did the best that you could!
Come on, cheer up!

125
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:06,254
Luna!

126
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,692
What's wrong...?

127
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:40,148
Don't come here...

128
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:41,554
Sailor Moon!

129
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,289
Usagi...

130
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:52,495
Your idealism is too painful to watch.

131
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:53,866
Michiru...?

132
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,374
Why yes, the world was saved.

133
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:02,537
But... we can't forgive
you for what you did!

134
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:06,878
Your idealism in protecting the Warrior
of Ruin almost destroyed this planet...

135
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,350
Usagi, you...

136
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:13,378
...have no qualifications
to be the future queen!

137
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:16,553
Oh, how horrible!

138
00:13:16,592 --> 00:13:18,423
I thought we understood each other!

139
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:20,395
Haruka!

140
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,829
Wait, guys.

141
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:24,389
Just like we initially
thought these guys...

142
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:27,562
...are so hardheaded
that it's beyond our reach!

143
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:32,563
Will you try to bend
these tough heads?

144
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:36,403
Are you picking a fight!?

145
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:43,451
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

146
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:45,885
MAKE UP!

147
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:48,688
URANUS PLANET POWER...

148
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:51,023
MAKE UP!

149
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:20,614
Let's go!

150
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:25,320
JUPITER STAR POWER...

151
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:28,729
MARS STAR POWER...

152
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:29,561
Don't...!

153
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:32,929
VENUS STAR POWER...

154
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:35,928
MERCURY STAR POWER...

155
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:37,937
MAKE UP!

156
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:08,029
Uranus! Neptune!

157
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,064
I have no grudge against you,
but I can't tolerate you criticizing Usagi!

158
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:16,806
Sailor Moon fought to
the best of her ability!

159
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:18,809
Everyone, stop!!

160
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:23,516
I don't want everyone to fight...

161
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:25,045
Please stop...

162
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:28,052
You really are a hopeless idealist.

163
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:29,480
Usagi...?

164
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:32,323
Aren't you upset after
all that they've said!?

165
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:34,789
I'm not upset at all.

166
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,822
Because it's true.

167
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:39,357
I'm a crybaby... and naive...

168
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:41,393
But...

169
00:15:41,437 --> 00:15:43,337
I don't think I've done anything wrong!

170
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,835
Sailor Saturn may have
been the Warrior of Ruin...

171
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:51,837
...but she is still one
of us Sailor Soldiers!

172
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:57,350
I was happy that we could understand
each other, to feel each other's warmth!

173
00:15:57,753 --> 00:16:00,847
Haruka, Michiru,
please undo your transformations!

174
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:02,856
Everyone else, too!

175
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,854
Usagi...

176
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:08,229
If you want us to,
you have to force us to.

177
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:11,961
Unless you do,
we will be enemies forever...

178
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:12,865
Usagi...

179
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,869
All right...

180
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:20,867
Usagi!

181
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:23,268
Don't help me.

182
00:16:23,312 --> 00:16:24,870
This is my responsibility...

183
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:30,208
MOON COSMIC POWER...

184
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:32,585
MAKE UP!

185
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:05,721
It's finally time for
the main character to appear.

186
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:06,915
We won't go easy on you.

187
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:12,958
DEEP...

188
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,485
...SUBMERGE!!

189
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,737
Sailor Moon!

190
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:26,472
Tuxedo Mask!

191
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:32,673
For two hearts to truly
understand each other...

192
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:35,809
...sometimes harsh
collisions are necessary.

193
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:38,046
No need to interrupt.

194
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:47,127
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to cry?

195
00:17:47,163 --> 00:17:49,654
Princess Crybaby.

196
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:52,167
Undo... your transformations!

197
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:57,368
WORLD...

198
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:59,670
...SHAKING!

199
00:18:06,949 --> 00:18:07,677
Where is she?

200
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:09,316
Behind you!

201
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:19,551
Please stop, Uranus!

202
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,701
Rather amazing.

203
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:28,998
Sailor Moon!

204
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:32,005
This is it, Sailor Moon!

205
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:43,581
What!?

206
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:02,827
Uranus, Neptune...?

207
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,607
Nothing less from the Princess...

208
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:10,635
No, the future Neo Queen Serenity.

209
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,343
We have been shown with your
true powers in the very end.

210
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:16,845
The very end...?

211
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:21,121
Everything we need to
do in this town is now over.

212
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:25,856
We found the true Messiah,
and the Earth has been saved.

213
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:28,363
Our mission has been completed.

214
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:31,862
The true Messiah... who is it?

215
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:34,793
Sheesh, there she goes again.

216
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:38,864
She even draws the
Warrior of Ruin onto her side.

217
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:41,373
Uranus!

218
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,206
Neptune!

219
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:45,672
Since we came to this town,
it's been a series of battles.

220
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:48,275
It was a rather tough everyday life,
right, Neptune?

221
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,285
But it was worth it.

222
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,052
Yeah... It wasn't just Sailor Saturn
that was saved by the messiah.

223
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:58,219
We were, as well.
I guess I should say... "Thank you"...

224
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:01,726
Wait... tell me one thing...

225
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:05,225
Is Hotaru... alive?

226
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:07,459
I'm sure you'll see her again.

227
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,495
So she's alive...!!

228
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:12,234
I'm so glad...!

229
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:19,234
