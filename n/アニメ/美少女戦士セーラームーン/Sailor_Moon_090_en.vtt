WEBVTT

00:01.948 --> 00:07.181
The tough battle has ended, and
peace has returned... or so I thought.

00:07.220 --> 00:09.381
We're in ninth grade now!?

00:09.423 --> 00:11.983
We have to study for
high school entrance exams!

00:12.025 --> 00:16.155
And now there are new enemies
on top of all of this!

00:16.196 --> 00:17.356
Sheesh!

00:17.397 --> 00:20.230
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you all!

00:36.442 --> 00:39.036
Silence is approaching!

00:41.213 --> 00:44.046
It's no good... I can't win!

00:46.718 --> 00:48.618
Are you the Messiah?

00:51.857 --> 00:54.985
Please help everyone!

01:01.667 --> 01:02.759
Wait!

01:32.364 --> 01:33.763
What's wrong, Rei?

01:33.799 --> 01:35.460
You seemed to be having a nightmare.

01:35.501 --> 01:38.868
Oh, um, sorry, it's nothing.

01:38.904 --> 01:40.235
It's just that...

01:40.272 --> 01:41.705
I had a strange dream...

01:41.740 --> 01:43.298
A strange dream?

01:44.743 --> 01:47.177
I had a weird dream, too.

01:47.212 --> 01:50.704
I went to the hospital because
I ate too much ice cream.

01:50.749 --> 01:52.216
And there...

01:52.251 --> 01:56.119
Mamo-chan was brought in on a stretcher
because he ate too many mooncakes!

01:56.154 --> 02:00.784
And we bumped into each other
in the kitchen of the hospital...

02:00.826 --> 02:02.157
Isn't it funny?

02:02.461 --> 02:03.928
It's funny...

02:03.962 --> 02:06.692
But it's no time for us
to be having dreams like that.

02:06.732 --> 02:09.963
Usagi, how did you do on
that exam we had two days ago?

02:13.438 --> 02:16.498
Well, I don't think
I got zero points...

02:16.942 --> 02:19.342
We're in ninth grade now!

02:19.378 --> 02:21.744
We have less than a year before
high school entrance exams!

02:22.214 --> 02:22.839
Yeah...

02:22.881 --> 02:25.577
We have to catch up academically;
we're behind because of our battles!

02:25.617 --> 02:28.745
They say, "Don't regret
the fish eggs from before."

02:29.321 --> 02:32.085
Wait, Usagi. Don't memorize that.

02:32.124 --> 02:34.991
It should be "No use
crying over spilt milk."

02:35.027 --> 02:37.291
Oh yeah, you can say it that way, too.

02:37.329 --> 02:40.127
But "the fish eggs from before"
sounds better to me...

02:40.165 --> 02:40.995
Yeah.

02:41.033 --> 02:44.764
Like when Artemis eats the fish eggs
I was looking forward to snacking on...

02:44.803 --> 02:46.430
I think, why didn't I eat them earlier?

02:46.471 --> 02:48.336
But you'd get it wrong on the exam.

02:49.374 --> 02:51.274
Hey, Ami, how do you solve this?

02:54.646 --> 02:57.274
For this problem, you do this...

03:34.219 --> 03:35.811
Kaorinite.

03:36.855 --> 03:38.823
Right here.

03:39.458 --> 03:42.518
The Daimohn Egg has
finally been completed.

03:42.561 --> 03:48.500
Daimohn selects humans with pure
hearts, and steals their hearts.

03:48.533 --> 03:50.296
Pure hearts?

03:50.335 --> 03:51.563
Yes!

03:51.603 --> 03:55.471
The holy grail that allows the holder
to do anything they wish to this world!

03:55.507 --> 03:59.603
It will appear when the three
talismans are gathered at one place!

03:59.645 --> 04:03.206
The three talismans are
the crystallization of...

04:03.248 --> 04:07.082
...the pure, yes, pure
hearts of the chosen ones!

04:07.119 --> 04:12.113
Therefore, if we find the chosen ones,
and get a hold of the talismans--

04:12.324 --> 04:17.227
We will have the holy grail,
and the world, in our hands!!

04:43.088 --> 04:45.022
I'm at a loss!

04:46.792 --> 04:50.853
This score is bad no matter
how you look at it...

04:53.865 --> 04:57.699
I wonder what Mom and Dad
will say when they see this...

04:57.736 --> 05:00.364
More over, what if Rei sees this...

05:02.574 --> 05:06.977
And of course, I always bump
into Rei at times like this!

05:09.548 --> 05:11.175
OW!

05:11.216 --> 05:13.377
Usagi?

05:13.785 --> 05:17.721
Sheesh, Usagi! You're just
standing there all spaced out!

05:18.156 --> 05:21.592
You were all spaced out yourself, Rei!

05:21.626 --> 05:22.718
Move over!

05:23.528 --> 05:26.861
Well, I can't blame you for being
so down with a test score like that.

05:27.232 --> 05:29.359
Well, excuse me!

05:30.102 --> 05:35.870
But, Usagi, you have a lot of good traits
outside of studying, so don't worry.

05:36.441 --> 05:39.103
Oh? You're not like how
you usually are, Rei.

05:44.483 --> 05:47.008
You think so...?

05:47.052 --> 05:50.112
Hey, what do you dream of
doing in the future, Usagi?

05:52.457 --> 05:53.890
Dream...?

05:53.925 --> 05:56.723
I don't know, everything
is so mixed up...

05:56.762 --> 05:58.127
How about you, Rei?

05:58.930 --> 06:00.090
Me?

06:00.132 --> 06:08.631
A singer-songwriter, a model,
a wonderful voice actress, and...

06:12.144 --> 06:14.339
And?

06:14.446 --> 06:16.846
I can't!

06:17.916 --> 06:22.182
A loving wife to someone I love!
I can't say that!

06:22.220 --> 06:24.211
But you just did.

06:24.256 --> 06:28.158
You're going to marry
Mamoru someday, right, Usagi?

06:28.193 --> 06:30.957
Oh! You embarrass me!
So embarrassing! Embarrassing!

06:31.396 --> 06:34.957
With a pathetic score like that, Mamoru
would be more embarrassed than you are.

06:35.667 --> 06:36.964
That hurt.

06:37.836 --> 06:41.533
Studying isn't everything,
but for the future...

06:41.573 --> 06:45.202
Usagi, you have to try a little
harder for Mamoru's sake as well.

06:45.243 --> 06:47.473
Well, I'll see you later.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.846
Cheer up, Usagi.

06:50.882 --> 06:53.976
That's really your only good trait.

06:54.186 --> 06:56.154
Sheesh!

06:56.188 --> 07:03.094
She talks tough, but she honestly wants
the best for me and all of our friends.

07:03.128 --> 07:04.493
Thanks, Rei.

07:33.859 --> 07:35.588
Hurry and appear...

07:35.627 --> 07:37.822
...the one with a pure heart.

07:46.638 --> 07:50.165
But what Rei says IS right...

07:54.079 --> 07:57.173
If Mamo-chan saw a test
score like this...

07:57.215 --> 07:59.012
This is horrible...

07:59.050 --> 08:01.018
...he would say, I'm sure...

08:04.756 --> 08:06.348
Such great weather out today!

08:06.858 --> 08:08.086
Usako...

08:08.126 --> 08:14.588
Well, so we're all getting
together at Rei's house to study!

08:15.433 --> 08:17.025
Looks like you should do that...

08:17.068 --> 08:20.936
Since we haven't been able to study much
due to all the fighting we've been doing.

08:21.973 --> 08:24.703
Then, it will be a little lonely, but I
guess we won't be able to date for a bit.

08:26.912 --> 08:30.814
Well, uh, I don't think...
you need to go... that far...

08:30.849 --> 08:32.908
Now, go do your best.

08:32.951 --> 08:34.748
Thanks.

08:34.786 --> 08:35.946
See ya.

08:39.391 --> 08:40.949
This is tough!

08:49.701 --> 08:52.226
What was that dream last night...?

08:52.570 --> 08:57.234
Rin-byou-tou-sha-kai-jin-retsu-zai-zen!

09:07.452 --> 09:11.115
No good... I can't feel anything...

09:16.561 --> 09:19.257
I wonder if it's nothing after all...

09:27.172 --> 09:29.766
Number 27...

09:42.654 --> 09:48.251
I hope that everyone will live happily
without anything bad happening...

09:49.594 --> 09:50.492
What!?

10:05.010 --> 10:06.500
MIKUJI!

10:06.678 --> 10:08.373
W-What is this...?

10:08.413 --> 10:12.850
I will have your pure heart
that worries about your friends!

10:13.885 --> 10:17.343
Fighting here will get Grandpa
and the others involved too!

10:56.194 --> 10:59.823
Your fortune today is VERY BAD.

11:00.498 --> 11:02.159
Daimohn Mikuji.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.761
There might be a talisman
hidden within this girl.

11:05.804 --> 11:08.272
Take her pure heart.

11:08.540 --> 11:10.269
Daimohn?

11:10.408 --> 11:11.773
MIKUJI!

11:22.320 --> 11:25.118
It is a matter of time
before we see results.

11:25.156 --> 11:30.253
I shall go seek other humans that have
the possibility of holding talismans.

11:39.003 --> 11:43.372
I'd rather go on a date with Mamo-chan
instead of studying after all...

11:43.408 --> 11:44.636
You can't.

11:44.676 --> 11:46.803
I'll go do that after all!

11:46.845 --> 11:51.578
Now, Usagi! You promised everyone
that you would study, didn't you!?

11:51.616 --> 11:53.516
BUT!

11:53.551 --> 11:55.712
If you don't go, I'll--

11:56.387 --> 11:58.218
All right!

11:58.256 --> 12:01.817
Really, Luna, you don't
understand what a girl feels...

12:01.860 --> 12:05.193
You mean how a sloth feels.

12:06.831 --> 12:07.991
That's Rei's voice!

12:08.032 --> 12:09.397
I wonder what's going on?

12:17.976 --> 12:19.443
W-W-W-What is that!?

12:19.477 --> 12:22.571
I don't know,
but you should transform.

12:24.549 --> 12:27.643
MOON CRYSTAL POWER...

12:27.685 --> 12:30.279
...MAKE UP!

13:08.760 --> 13:10.250
Hold it right there!

13:10.762 --> 13:12.195
For love and justice...

13:12.230 --> 13:14.994
...the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

13:19.370 --> 13:20.997
Sailor Moon!

13:22.707 --> 13:23.833
Sailor Moon?

13:24.175 --> 13:28.339
I can't for give you for harassing
my pure-hearted friend!

13:30.148 --> 13:33.606
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

13:34.719 --> 13:37.847
She was targeted because
of her pure heart!

13:38.223 --> 13:40.123
The target is a pure heart?

13:40.558 --> 13:42.116
Your fortune is...

13:44.095 --> 13:46.689
...VERY BAD!

13:53.571 --> 13:55.402
What is that monster?

13:55.440 --> 13:56.532
Another monster?

13:56.574 --> 13:58.701
Let's transform and fight!

14:00.778 --> 14:03.474
Your fortunes are...

14:07.885 --> 14:10.012
BAD!

14:12.223 --> 14:13.247
It's strong...

14:13.291 --> 14:15.555
Several times stronger
than previous enemies...

14:17.161 --> 14:21.063
How should I get rid of
these pesky interruptions?

14:26.704 --> 14:27.671
Who is that!?

14:29.007 --> 14:35.242
Ruffian who creates a storm of
riots in the warm sun of spring!

14:35.280 --> 14:36.679
Retreat now!

14:37.081 --> 14:39.447
Shall I tell your fortune too?

14:40.785 --> 14:41.809
Now, Sailor Moon!

14:42.287 --> 14:43.311
Okay!

15:02.640 --> 15:06.736
MOON PRINCESS...

15:06.778 --> 15:09.975
...HALATION!

15:12.850 --> 15:14.215
Damn you!

15:14.252 --> 15:17.187
VERY BAD TRIANGLE!

15:26.998 --> 15:29.865
THE MOST UNLUCKY DAY!

15:54.025 --> 15:55.686
Can such a thing...?

15:55.727 --> 15:57.217
Sailor... Mo-

15:57.662 --> 15:59.721
Usako!

16:00.098 --> 16:01.793
Your fortune is...

16:01.833 --> 16:03.232
BAD!

16:03.701 --> 16:05.760
Tuxedo Mask!

16:07.438 --> 16:08.769
I can't watch anymore.

16:08.806 --> 16:10.068
Luna!

16:10.108 --> 16:11.302
Damn you!

16:14.479 --> 16:16.379
- Artemis!
- Luna!

16:16.414 --> 16:19.815
Is that the last interruption?

16:19.851 --> 16:23.014
Then, I shall take my time
to get the pure heart.

16:33.631 --> 16:34.655
Stop!

16:46.210 --> 16:47.074
Rei!

16:47.111 --> 16:48.373
Rei!!

16:50.681 --> 16:52.410
Rei! Hold yourself together!

16:52.583 --> 16:54.551
Rei! Rei!!

16:54.585 --> 16:57.713
What do you dream of doing
in the future, Usagi?

16:57.755 --> 17:05.890
Me? A singer-songwriter, amodel,
a wonderful voiceactress, and...

17:05.930 --> 17:12.665
I can't! A loving wife to someone
I love. I can't say that!

17:12.703 --> 17:14.967
Cheer up, Usagi.

17:15.006 --> 17:18.669
That's really your only good trait.

17:18.709 --> 17:21.109
Usagi!

17:21.412 --> 17:23.710
Rei...

17:26.617 --> 17:31.247
There must be a talisman inside
this crystal of her pure heart.

17:32.123 --> 17:33.181
Give that back!

17:33.224 --> 17:36.159
Give that back to Rei!

17:36.194 --> 17:38.754
I won't forgive you!

17:41.532 --> 17:42.624
Humans...

17:42.667 --> 17:46.159
Such pathetic creaturrrrrrr...

17:49.006 --> 17:52.806
Wha--!?
What in the world is going on!?

17:52.844 --> 17:56.439
EVIL WARD!

18:18.903 --> 18:21.337
Rei! Rei!

18:21.405 --> 18:22.201
Hold yourself together!

18:22.240 --> 18:24.367
- Rei!
- REI!!

18:27.144 --> 18:28.236
Rei!

18:28.279 --> 18:32.272
Hold yourself together! Rei...

18:33.084 --> 18:35.109
This is not a talisman!

18:35.152 --> 18:37.382
Looks like they had the wrong target.

18:39.090 --> 18:40.887
A trip wasted.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.658
Rei...

18:45.363 --> 18:47.763
Answer me!

19:06.784 --> 19:08.149
Rei...?

19:21.399 --> 19:22.923
She came to...

19:22.967 --> 19:25.162
I...

19:28.639 --> 19:31.733
Rei is back to normal!

19:31.976 --> 19:34.570
I'm so glad!

19:34.679 --> 19:37.079
Usagi...

19:40.217 --> 19:41.741
Are you sure you're not hurt at all?

19:41.786 --> 19:43.686
Yeah, I'm all right.

19:43.721 --> 19:45.120
You don't feel pain?

19:45.156 --> 19:47.021
No.

19:47.058 --> 19:48.787
Do you itch anywhere?

19:48.826 --> 19:50.054
No.

19:50.094 --> 19:54.554
- Do you have anything you want to eat?
- Those two...

19:54.599 --> 19:57.500
Don't cry anymore.

19:58.469 --> 20:03.702
Kaorinite. It seems the target
wasn't the holder of a talisman.

20:03.774 --> 20:06.402
Correct. We also had an
uncalculated interruption.

20:06.444 --> 20:09.208
I will be careful in the future.

20:09.246 --> 20:13.307
The new enemy seems to be
after people with pure hearts.

20:13.351 --> 20:16.809
They said something about
talismans being inside them...

20:16.854 --> 20:20.312
And those two mysterious people...

20:22.893 --> 20:26.727
A... new battle is about to begin...?

20:29.727 --> 20:33.727
