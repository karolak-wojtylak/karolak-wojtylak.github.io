1
00:00:02,282 --> 00:00:06,878
Suddenly a beautiful boy named Haruka
Tenoh appears before our eyes!

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,186
He brings a beautiful girl with him. Is
this what you call a picturesque couple?

3
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:14,193
And the mysterious soldiers
finally show themselves!

4
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:20,132
If you are bad girls, I, Sailor Moon,
will punish you in the name of the moon!

5
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:28,374
Oh, man... We're studying for entrance
exams again at Rei's place today...

6
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:34,479
I can't, I can't!

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,420
I have to bear it until the
entrance exams are over!

8
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:39,891
Everyone else is doing their best, too!

9
00:00:42,028 --> 00:00:42,858
What?!

10
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,660
That's right!

11
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:58,200
And Artemis didn't get the hint,
and ate another caramel!

12
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:03,978
And of course, the caramel
got stuck onto his tooth...

13
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:07,543
And because he's a cat, he couldn't pry
off the caramel stuck onto his tooth...

14
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:12,216
...and he was squirming
around so much...

15
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:19,289
Oh? Usagi...

16
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:22,664
I was thinking everyone else was doing
their best, so I was keeping myself away...

17
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:25,534
And yet you're here...

18
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:28,631
No, I lured Minako in here.

19
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:30,232
I asked her if she wanted to
come in every once in a while...

20
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:31,834
...because she can get tired
from studying too much.

21
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:35,643
Motoki! Don't you think you're
being a little easy on her?

22
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:36,648
Uh, er, no...

23
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:37,910
Usagi!

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,941
We're only young once!

25
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:42,715
What happens if we
fail our entrance exams?

26
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:47,749
Won't you think, "Oh, I wish I had been
playing and having fun back then"?

27
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:50,887
And they do say, "haste makes dancing."

28
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,956
I think you should
be studying after all.

29
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:57,526
If that's the case... Over here!

30
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,903
I think you should
be studying after all...

31
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:06,742
Go!

32
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:10,372
I'm a lap behind!

33
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,748
Seeya!

34
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:17,854
Stay! Stay!

35
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:34,806
I'm getting carsick...

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,332
Come on now! Try again, Usagi!

37
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:41,312
I think we should be going to
Rei's place soon, or otherwise...

38
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:43,076
There's no time for that!

39
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:47,575
If we stop now, who is going to conquer
the Formula 1 world in the future?

40
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,520
I don't really want to conquer...

41
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:51,045
Then, miss.

42
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,456
Can I drive along side of you...?

43
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,870
- You're...
- ...kidding.

44
00:03:17,183 --> 00:03:19,481
Oh, go right ahead!

45
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:21,076
Can you hold my bag?

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,147
Please, let her hold
as many as you want!

47
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:28,691
I'm so lucky!

48
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:33,255
It's not every day that such a hot
guy comes up and talks to you!

49
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,270
So, how do ya like
my wonder fulsteering?

50
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:53,343
Um... the race began already...

51
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:54,511
I know...

52
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,950
You see... I have to
give her a handicap...

53
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:01,757
A handicap!?

54
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:07,926
How dare he say that tome, Minako Aino,
who will conquer the Formula 1 world?!

55
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:11,126
I think it's about time now...

56
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:25,649
Impossible...
Exactly how fast is he going!?

57
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,043
I see... amazing.

58
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:29,918
Not even close...

59
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,331
I'm a lap back?!

60
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:50,341
Complete defeat.

61
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:53,339
That's not true. You did pretty well.

62
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:56,348
I guess cute girls have
good gaming sense as well...

63
00:04:56,882 --> 00:04:58,782
Really?

64
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:02,617
Well... a lot of people say that to me...

65
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:04,623
Sorry to keep you waiting, Haruka.

66
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,129
You're kidding...

67
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:27,138
Well, see you later.

68
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:28,980
S-Sure.

69
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:30,504
You with the buns...

70
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:32,642
We should race together next time.

71
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:34,947
Sure...

72
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:41,626
You sure got to know them well...

73
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,855
What... are you jealous?

74
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:46,554
Maybe.

75
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:51,126
They still seem so childish,
they're really cute...

76
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:55,302
They're both so beautiful...

77
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:58,367
So that man's name is Haruka...

78
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,369
Come to think, I've been seeing
the two of them around here a lot...

79
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:04,609
Oh, were you here, Motoki?

80
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,142
Well, I DO work here...

81
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:19,162
I feel it...

82
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:22,497
The sea is about to be stormy again...

83
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,230
We really have to be
careful in this town.

84
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,431
Seems so...

85
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:31,634
Minako, I think those two are lovers...

86
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:32,939
I've made up my mind.

87
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:38,078
He's the one! He's the ideal
man I've been looking for!

88
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,011
W-Wait a minute, Minako!

89
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:42,316
He already has a girlfriend, see!?

90
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:45,221
But you didn't ask
those two that, did you!?

91
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:50,723
I, Minako, will have my
heart burn with this romance!

92
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:54,631
Miss, please return to your seat...

93
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:06,376
They really are lovers after all...

94
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:12,009
Usagi, you don't have to come with me
anymore. I'll do the rest myself.

95
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,645
No way! I'm curious about
that handsome guy, too!

96
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:18,247
But you have Mamoru, Usagi!

97
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:26,495
See! They separated already!

98
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:29,000
They weren't lovers at all!

99
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:39,767
Mr. Kameda.

100
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:41,272
Hello...

101
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,475
Hey. You're here again?

102
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:44,607
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,676
Can you wait a while?
I'm almost done with this...

104
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,515
Sure.

105
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:54,582
Kaorinite...

106
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,418
Yes, I am here.

107
00:07:57,663 --> 00:07:58,925
Did you find it?

108
00:07:59,298 --> 00:08:02,426
A human with the chosen pure heart.

109
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:06,204
Yes... I have a good idea already.

110
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:08,638
I see...

111
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,379
Good, good...

112
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:22,216
Good girl.

113
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:24,745
Go, egg of Daimohn...

114
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,282
Take a pure heart, and bring it to me!

115
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,381
Now, you go ahead, and
hurry over to Rei's place!

116
00:08:58,423 --> 00:08:59,981
No! I don't want to!

117
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:03,722
I'm curious about that
handsome guy as well!

118
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:35,624
Little kittens...

119
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:39,062
How long are you going to hide there?

120
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:41,588
So you knew about us?

121
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:46,404
Haruka Tenoh.

122
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:47,598
Tenth grade.

123
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:50,436
You wanted to know, right?

124
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:53,035
About me...

125
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:54,439
Yes!

126
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,707
That's right!

127
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:56,975
Right!

128
00:09:58,283 --> 00:10:01,480
The other things that you
have been wanting to know...

129
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,612
Yes!

130
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:05,919
The person who you were with until a few
minutes ago... how is she related to you?

131
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:06,982
...to you?

132
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,991
What kind of relationship do you have?

133
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:10,995
...have?

134
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,224
She's not your lover... right?

135
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:14,254
Right?

136
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:17,262
Lovers? Michiru and me?

137
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:21,204
Michiru... so you guys are close
enough to not use honorifics?

138
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,263
...not use them?

139
00:10:22,474 --> 00:10:27,002
Let's see... You could say
we're closer than that...

140
00:10:29,381 --> 00:10:32,009
But... don't give up.

141
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:35,147
You two still have a chance...

142
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:37,621
O-Okay...

143
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,556
Don't be fooled...

144
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:41,524
Michiru...

145
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,519
This person always says things like
that when cute girls are spotted.

146
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:47,532
Isn't that a little much to say?

147
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:51,263
Oh, is it all right to say that to me?

148
00:10:51,303 --> 00:10:53,464
I'll just take what I
brought for you and go home.

149
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:55,473
Come on...

150
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:56,705
Question!

151
00:10:56,742 --> 00:10:59,267
Are you Haruka's lover?

152
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:01,472
Please answer yes or no!

153
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:04,209
No.

154
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:05,307
All right!

155
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,113
This romance is mine!

156
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:08,176
It's mine!

157
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,781
You have Mamoru, Usagi!

158
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:15,782
Today's Minako is
snappier than usual...

159
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:17,795
She's acting just like Rei.

160
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,731
Oh, no.. I wonder if it's pollen...

161
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,530
You have to be careful
during this season.

162
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:27,004
In any case, Usagi and
Minako sure are late...

163
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,200
What are both of them doing?

164
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:32,170
I'm worried that it's BOTH of them...

165
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:34,135
I wonder if something happened...

166
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:36,579
In any case, knowing the two of them...

167
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:40,745
Don't you think they probably
found a cute boy, and followed him?

168
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:43,084
Impossible... even they...

169
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:52,827
Mr. Kameda over there is
trying to become a mechanic...

170
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:56,163
...who can tune up cars to
international racing standards...

171
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:58,499
That's why I like coming here...

172
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:04,635
I think I can see a racing circuit beyond
here, swaying in the haze from a mirage.

173
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:16,012
The wind that blows across
a circuit carries a wonderful scent...

174
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:18,181
Um... Haruka, you're...

175
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:22,455
Haruka's dream is to become
the top race car driver...

176
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:25,019
No... That's not true.

177
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:26,724
It's not a dream...

178
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,323
It WAS a dream...

179
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:29,560
It WAS a dream?

180
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:32,069
Then what is your dream now?

181
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:35,770
To do something that only I can do.

182
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:38,901
And to do that,
I will make any sacrifice...

183
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:40,775
No matter what I lose...

184
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:43,804
I won't regret it...

185
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:46,846
He really is awesome...

186
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:49,820
Yeah... He loses to
Mamo-chan, but still...

187
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:52,449
All right!

188
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:54,591
I think that about does it.

189
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:01,421
What is it?

190
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:02,262
Mr. Kameda!

191
00:13:04,636 --> 00:13:06,365
Haruka...

192
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:07,496
I know...

193
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:25,752
STEERINGOO!

194
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,281
W-What is this?

195
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:30,752
I'll take that pure heart
which rides on your dreams!

196
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:34,095
JACK UP!

197
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:37,363
HEY!

198
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:39,131
Stop that!

199
00:13:55,587 --> 00:13:56,781
Stop it!

200
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,527
I'll now have this crystal checked by
lady Kaorinite to see if it's a talisman.

201
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,577
Oh, no!!

202
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:25,549
We have to hurry and get
his heart's crystal back...

203
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:27,245
Haruka!

204
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:30,248
He's gone...

205
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:34,691
Minako... it's not the time
to be saying such things...

206
00:14:34,726 --> 00:14:35,750
I know...

207
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:38,862
VENUS STAR POWER...

208
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:41,422
...MAKE UP!

209
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:05,556
MOON COSMIC POWER...

210
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,115
...MAKE UP!

211
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:55,196
Let's go, Michiru!

212
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,798
Fine!

213
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,770
They're flying!?

214
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:08,113
Look out!

215
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:13,148
Kabooom!

216
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:16,126
Kerpow!

217
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:20,531
This is too dangerous...

218
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:24,296
I'm glad I was wearing a helmet...

219
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:26,734
We finally caught up to you!

220
00:16:26,771 --> 00:16:29,331
The pure heart of a man
chasing his dream!

221
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:31,308
We won't let villains take it away!

222
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:34,304
For love and justice...

223
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:38,305
...the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!
Sailor Moon!

224
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:43,549
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

225
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:46,555
Wait a minute!
You made me pedal the bike!

226
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,559
Don't look so cool all by yourself!.

227
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:52,828
Today's Venus is snappier than usual...

228
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:58,462
I will not allow any more traffic
obstructions to block my driving!

229
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:06,904
Hold it!

230
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:08,177
Who is it?

231
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:11,678
Guided by a new era, Sailor Uranus...

232
00:17:11,716 --> 00:17:14,184
...acts with elegance!

233
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:18,121
Also guided by a new era,
Sailor Neptune...

234
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:20,181
...acts with grace!

235
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:24,189
We have a reason to seek the talismans.

236
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:26,527
We won't let you
have the heart's crystal!

237
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:29,356
The mysterious soldiers...

238
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:31,392
...were sailor soldiers?

239
00:17:31,436 --> 00:17:34,872
Are you trying to obstruct
my course as well!?

240
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:40,734
WORLD...

241
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:43,304
...SHAKING!

242
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,015
DEEP...

243
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,255
...SUBMERGE!

244
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:06,496
Now's your chance, Sailor Moon!

245
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:07,436
I got it!

246
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:30,860
MOON SPIRAL...

247
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:34,259
...HEART...

248
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:36,790
...ATTACK!

249
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:47,008
Lovely!

250
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,959
No... this isn't a talisman either.

251
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:06,429
Looks that way...

252
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:07,522
Sailor Moon.

253
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:13,331
Return that to its rightful owner.

254
00:19:21,212 --> 00:19:25,080
And so, that was the
last we saw of Haruka...

255
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:28,347
So in other words both
of you really were...

256
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:31,549
...ditching the study group
to chase a cute guy!?

257
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:38,253
Everyone, we have to research the new
sailor soldiers before all of this.

258
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:41,823
That's fine, Luna and Artemis
are doing the research right now.

259
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:42,890
I see...

260
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:45,494
That's why I didn't
see either of them...

261
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:47,562
Oh...

262
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:49,072
Michiru!

263
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,210
Aren't you with Haruka today?

264
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,802
I am.

265
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:56,143
Where? Where is this cute guy? Where?

266
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:58,843
Where? Where is the guy that looks
like the upperclassman we know?

267
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:00,850
Where is he?

268
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:13,421
A girl...

269
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:14,362
...right?

270
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:19,597
I don't recall ever
saying that I was a guy...

271
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:22,435
That can't be...

272
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:27,233
We don't have time for all of this...

273
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:32,113
I thought Mamo-chan was better
from the beginning! Yeah, I did!

274
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:39,113
