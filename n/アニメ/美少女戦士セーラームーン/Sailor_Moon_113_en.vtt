00:02.000 --> 00:06.994
I see, so this is Chibiusa's
new friend Hotaru Tomoe...

00:07.038 --> 00:08.938
Hey, she's pretty cute!

00:08.973 --> 00:12.602
Elegant, and somewhat fragile...
Totally different from you!

00:12.644 --> 00:14.805
Make sure you aren't rude to her!

00:14.846 --> 00:17.144
If you do cause her any trouble...

00:17.181 --> 00:20.082
In the name of the moon, I'll punish you!

00:26.150 --> 00:30.484
Oh, Chibiusa, you seem to
be in a rather good mood.

00:30.521 --> 00:33.012
I have a new friend!

00:33.057 --> 00:34.615
Oh?

00:34.659 --> 00:36.718
Come on, tell me,
what kinda person? A boy?

00:36.761 --> 00:39.787
How far into the relationship
are you? Tell me!

00:39.831 --> 00:43.528
I won't tell klutz Usagi anything!

00:47.772 --> 00:50.400
How dare you!

00:53.077 --> 00:56.877
What are you doing, Usagi, you idiot!

01:23.875 --> 01:27.641
We have been waiting for you, Mamoru...
No, Sir Endymion.

01:32.183 --> 01:35.914
The warriors of the Silver Millenium,
from the distant past...

01:36.587 --> 01:38.919
And... ones summoned from the future.

01:39.691 --> 01:41.852
URANUS PLANET POWER...

01:41.893 --> 01:44.293
MAKE UP!

01:57.575 --> 02:00.510
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

02:00.545 --> 02:02.979
MAKE UP!

02:19.097 --> 02:21.964
PLUTO PLANET POWER...

02:21.999 --> 02:24.399
MAKE UP!

02:43.087 --> 02:47.217
Sailor Uranus, guarded by Uranus,
the star of the wind.

02:47.391 --> 02:50.690
Sailor Neptune, guarded by Neptune,
the star of the ocean.

02:50.728 --> 02:54.425
Sailor Pluto, guarded by Pluto,
the star of the afterlife.

02:54.465 --> 02:57.491
We are the three warriors
of the outer solar system!

02:57.969 --> 02:59.994
The outer solar system...

03:01.639 --> 03:07.578
Unlike the previous Sailor Soldiers,
we were given even stronger powers.

03:08.045 --> 03:12.277
From the distant past, our duty has
been to protect the Silver Millennium...

03:12.316 --> 03:16.514
...from enemies who intrude
from outside the solar system.

03:20.024 --> 03:23.255
But, when we awakened in this age...

03:23.294 --> 03:27.287
...the enemy had already quietly
nested deep down on this Earth.

03:27.331 --> 03:32.200
We had overlooked it. The intrusion of
the enemy this time is our mistake.

03:32.870 --> 03:37.204
Those are the Death Busters...
Our new enemy...!

03:37.975 --> 03:42.207
But why don't you try to join your
forces with Sailor Moon's group?

03:43.714 --> 03:45.375
They only get in our way...

03:45.416 --> 03:46.212
What?

03:46.784 --> 03:49.719
This battle... is too much for Sailor Moon...

03:49.754 --> 03:51.619
...and for Mars, Venus, and the others.

03:51.656 --> 03:55.615
Defeating the Death Busters,
the largest and strongest enemies...

03:55.660 --> 03:57.218
...is the job of us three.

04:01.599 --> 04:04.432
Eh? Chibiusa went to
all of your places, too?

04:04.468 --> 04:08.734
Yeah. She was saying how she was invited to
a new friend's house for the very first time...

04:09.574 --> 04:14.375
A formal dress? No, no.
As long as you look tidy, you're totally okay!

04:14.412 --> 04:16.744
Don't you want to play to your heart's content?

04:17.215 --> 04:19.843
She came to me, too, saying she
wanted to give something as a gift...

04:19.884 --> 04:23.183
Hmm... I don't think you
need to bring anything...

04:23.221 --> 04:25.416
But how about a book?

04:25.456 --> 04:28.550
Your friend will know what kind of books
you like to read as well, Chibiusa.

04:29.126 --> 04:32.061
She sure has that friend on her mind,
don't you think? Right?

04:32.096 --> 04:35.623
Although they go to different schools,
I heard that her friend is a very quiet person.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.566
So she's visiting a friend
for the first time, huh?

04:38.202 --> 04:40.568
I just baked some cookies,
so I'll wrap you some.

04:40.605 --> 04:42.869
You can take them to your friend's place.

04:43.441 --> 04:48.936
If I'd known, I'd have baked cookies with a
more extravagant way to express her feelings.

04:48.980 --> 04:49.947
H-Huh?

04:49.981 --> 04:51.608
Extravagant cookies...?

04:51.649 --> 04:52.980
I'm a little scared...

04:53.017 --> 04:54.484
She doesn't know any bounds lately...

04:54.518 --> 04:55.576
Who--

04:55.820 --> 04:58.084
Chibiusa came to my place, too...

04:59.190 --> 05:00.316
Rei...?

05:01.726 --> 05:05.628
Let's see... greetings when
you're invited somewhere...

05:05.663 --> 05:09.929
I, Usagi, will lecture you on
things like that right on the spot!

05:09.967 --> 05:11.161
Usagi!

05:11.202 --> 05:15.798
What are you saying, Usagi!
You have a study group to attend!

05:15.840 --> 05:17.068
Oh! Michael!

05:17.108 --> 05:20.441
Where? Where, where?
My Michael!

05:22.780 --> 05:25.214
Oh, Michael...

05:26.017 --> 05:27.450
Usagi...

05:27.485 --> 05:28.213
Sheesh...

05:30.588 --> 05:33.955
I'm telling you, you should bring
a more serious book if it's a gift...

05:33.991 --> 05:37.222
No. I was finally able to buy
one that's always sold out.

05:37.428 --> 05:40.625
I wanted the new Ukon Katakuri book...

05:40.932 --> 05:42.524
No!

05:42.566 --> 05:44.864
By the way, Usagi, are you
serious about tagging along?

05:46.170 --> 05:47.831
Well, I am curious.

05:47.872 --> 05:50.306
What kind of person
your friend is, and such...

05:50.341 --> 05:51.535
My friend is cute...

05:51.575 --> 05:53.873
...although a little frail, it seems.

06:02.586 --> 06:06.818
I feel a little sorry for your friend,
but that's just the perfect situation!

06:06.857 --> 06:09.257
Then, I really should introduce
myself as your guardian.

06:09.293 --> 06:10.817
What part of you is my guardian?

06:10.861 --> 06:13.022
- Now, now... let's go, let's go.
- Don't push me!

06:18.602 --> 06:23.039
Our illustrious Messiah of silence,
the time of your awakening is approaching!

06:23.574 --> 06:27.704
For that, I need powerful awakening energy.

06:28.412 --> 06:35.545
Leave it to me. I will change perfect, pure
hearts of humans into awakening energy.

06:35.886 --> 06:39.049
I hope they suit your tastes...

06:41.625 --> 06:44.059
Amazing!

06:44.362 --> 06:46.057
It's a huge house!

06:49.333 --> 06:50.459
Usagi, push it.

06:50.501 --> 06:51.866
Oh? Yeah, sure.

06:54.605 --> 06:56.129
Oh, hello...

06:58.175 --> 06:59.107
Excuse--

07:01.245 --> 07:02.075
Ka--

07:06.817 --> 07:08.910
K-Kaorinite...

07:08.953 --> 07:11.251
What are you doing, Usagi!?

07:11.288 --> 07:13.950
- Chibiusa.
- Those cookies were for...

07:13.991 --> 07:16.221
May I ask who you are?

07:16.260 --> 07:18.728
Is something wrong?
Is it a guest?

07:18.763 --> 07:19.593
Professor...

07:19.630 --> 07:22.531
Oh, you're one of Hotaru's friends.

07:22.566 --> 07:23.794
Oh, she's Hotaru's...

07:23.834 --> 07:25.165
Hello!

07:25.202 --> 07:28.399
Hello and welcome.
I'm Hotaru's father.

07:28.806 --> 07:30.569
H-Hello...

07:30.608 --> 07:34.066
Oh, this is my assistant, Kaori.

07:34.111 --> 07:37.137
Kaori, Hotaru is a little busy right now.

07:37.181 --> 07:39.775
Lead these ladies to the living room...

07:39.817 --> 07:40.909
Yes.

07:40.951 --> 07:43.283
Should I brew some tasty coffee...?

07:44.755 --> 07:45.983
Please, this way.

07:46.023 --> 07:47.786
Okay!

07:48.125 --> 07:52.494
She looks exactly like her,
but seems to be a different person...

07:52.530 --> 07:56.796
Well, if you think about it,
Kaorinite wouldn't be in a place like this...

08:21.859 --> 08:23.884
"What are you here for, Drop?"

08:24.328 --> 08:26.796
"It's your fault that Andre died."

08:27.098 --> 08:29.293
"No, Auntie, it is not!"

08:29.533 --> 08:30.693
"Yes, it was--"

08:30.734 --> 08:32.361
"Hush! Get out of my room!"

08:32.403 --> 08:34.303
"Drop!"

08:34.338 --> 08:37.796
How, how, how sad this main character is!

08:42.012 --> 08:43.809
Yes, this is Mimet.

08:44.215 --> 08:45.773
You finally answered.

08:45.816 --> 08:49.308
Mimet, have you found a new target?

08:51.622 --> 08:56.559
Of course, I've checked
out a talented pure heart.

08:57.728 --> 08:58.820
This will do.

08:58.863 --> 09:01.764
The target will be holding
an autograph session...

09:01.799 --> 09:04.563
Er, no, appearing at the
Juban Bookstore today.

09:04.835 --> 09:08.737
I see... Then I will hurry up
and make a Daimohn...

09:08.772 --> 09:11.570
...in order for it to make
it to the autograph session.

09:14.145 --> 09:17.444
Delicious coffee is ready!

09:21.385 --> 09:24.513
Uhenshu!

09:56.587 --> 09:57.611
Here you go.

09:57.655 --> 09:59.452
Thank you very much!

09:59.490 --> 10:01.617
Please continue to support me.

10:01.992 --> 10:05.018
Yes! I'll cherish this book
for the rest of my life!

10:13.237 --> 10:14.727
The coffee... isn't here yet...

10:14.772 --> 10:17.070
Usagi!

10:17.474 --> 10:19.635
Hotaru... is late...

10:33.324 --> 10:34.382
Chibiusa!

10:34.825 --> 10:36.292
Hotaru!

10:36.327 --> 10:38.090
A g-girl?

10:38.128 --> 10:40.392
Who said it was a boy?

10:42.700 --> 10:43.792
Your older sister...?

10:43.834 --> 10:45.165
My cousin, Usagi.

10:45.202 --> 10:48.433
She tagged along, thinking I was
going on a date with a cute little boy!

10:48.472 --> 10:50.872
Wha-! C-Chibiusa, I just...

10:50.908 --> 10:52.034
It's true, isn't it?

10:52.076 --> 10:54.670
I-I was just wanting to say
hello as your guardian...

10:54.712 --> 10:55.906
What are you saying?

10:55.946 --> 10:59.905
I can see through to what
you really were thinking!

11:00.184 --> 11:01.344
No, you're wrong!

11:01.385 --> 11:04.650
In the first place, it's all because
you're chasing after boys all the time!

11:04.688 --> 11:08.283
Tee hee! Unlike you, klutzy Usagi,
I'm popular with guys!

11:08.325 --> 11:09.690
What?!

11:10.728 --> 11:12.958
See, she's laughing at me!

11:12.997 --> 11:14.055
So it's my fault?

11:14.832 --> 11:16.026
I-I'm sorry...

11:16.066 --> 11:17.897
Welcome here.

11:17.935 --> 11:19.300
I'm Hotaru Tomoe.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.865
Oh, uh, hello...

11:21.905 --> 11:23.600
I hope you don't mind us here...

11:23.641 --> 11:27.304
I'm sorry to keep you waiting...
Please, come up to my room.

11:27.778 --> 11:31.305
Then, we'll take the coffee up to your room...

11:32.816 --> 11:33.976
That's all right!

11:34.018 --> 11:37.852
Don't butt into house affairs, Kaori!

11:42.693 --> 11:43.751
I'm sorry...

11:43.794 --> 11:45.523
My father is a scientist.

11:45.562 --> 11:49.396
Because he's busy with his research,
she comes by to help out, but...

11:49.433 --> 11:51.833
Hotaru, where's your mother?

11:53.237 --> 11:55.330
She died... a long time ago...

11:56.707 --> 11:59.835
Oh, I-I'm sorry... ur...

11:59.877 --> 12:01.845
No, it's all right.

12:02.780 --> 12:07.114
But I want to hear more
about you guys, Chibiusa!

12:15.759 --> 12:17.852
Amazing! It's so beautiful!

12:17.895 --> 12:19.863
Amazing, just amazing! It feels mysterious...

12:21.065 --> 12:21.861
Thanks.

12:24.835 --> 12:25.859
Hotaru!

12:26.203 --> 12:28.137
Hotaru, what's wrong? Are you all right?

12:28.172 --> 12:29.036
Hotaru!

12:31.475 --> 12:32.567
I-I'm fine...

12:32.609 --> 12:35.203
I was just a little dizzy.

12:35.245 --> 12:37.042
I'm really all right.

12:46.123 --> 12:48.318
What is... this?

12:48.359 --> 12:50.293
T-This is...?

12:54.598 --> 12:56.589
It's a strange brooch...

12:56.633 --> 13:00.034
As long as I touch it, I feel better and better...

13:00.571 --> 13:03.039
Power fows in...

13:06.043 --> 13:07.772
Hotaru!?

13:08.912 --> 13:12.143
Did I just say something?

13:12.583 --> 13:14.949
I'm sorry. I am rather strange...

13:14.985 --> 13:15.974
T-That's not...

13:16.019 --> 13:18.886
I know! Chibiusa, your gift, your gift!

13:18.922 --> 13:22.050
That's right, yeah, yeah.
This is really interesting!

13:24.895 --> 13:25.554
What's this?

13:26.864 --> 13:27.728
What, what?

13:27.765 --> 13:29.562
Ukon Katakuri... autograph... session!?

13:31.769 --> 13:33.430
It's already started!

13:33.470 --> 13:35.768
Why didn't you realize this earlier!?

13:35.806 --> 13:37.671
You were there in the
bookstore with me, Usagi!

13:37.708 --> 13:38.504
It's your fault!

13:38.542 --> 13:40.100
Why mine!?

13:42.679 --> 13:44.112
Oh, thank you very much for your hard word!

13:44.148 --> 13:45.410
Thank you so much!

13:45.449 --> 13:46.074
Thank you!

13:47.518 --> 13:49.577
Mr. Ukon!

13:50.053 --> 13:51.611
You are...?

13:52.089 --> 13:55.354
Thank you for the autograph earlier!

13:55.392 --> 13:56.882
Oh, yeah...

13:57.127 --> 14:00.893
And, I have one more thing I want from you...

14:02.699 --> 14:04.132
...your heart.

14:06.870 --> 14:09.600
Appear, Daimohn!

14:14.178 --> 14:15.110
W-What's this!?

14:16.180 --> 14:18.205
Uhenshu!

14:19.550 --> 14:22.986
Do you follow your deadlines?

14:29.293 --> 14:31.193
Autograph session!

14:32.162 --> 14:33.356
Are you all right?

14:33.397 --> 14:34.659
I-I'm sorry.

14:34.865 --> 14:38.096
Don't say you're sorry. We're friends.

14:40.604 --> 14:43.266
What's wrong, Usagi?

14:49.446 --> 14:50.936
You take care of Hotaru!

14:50.981 --> 14:51.970
Oh, got it!

14:52.683 --> 14:54.617
Hotaru, we're changing our plans!

14:54.651 --> 14:57.984
Since the autograph session is
already over, let's go to the arcade!

15:00.224 --> 15:03.591
MOON COSMIC POWER...

15:03.627 --> 15:06.027
MAKE UP!

15:40.531 --> 15:41.463
Hold it right there!

15:41.965 --> 15:44.399
There are people who haven't
gotten their autographs yet!

15:44.434 --> 15:46.994
Those who harm handsome
people in this world...

15:47.037 --> 15:50.905
For love and justice,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

15:50.941 --> 15:52.465
I, Sailor Moon...

15:54.211 --> 15:57.703
...will punish you in the name of the moon!

15:58.181 --> 16:00.547
You're here again? You're just a pest!

16:00.584 --> 16:02.142
Uhenshu, get rid of her!

16:02.185 --> 16:03.550
All right, editor-in-chief.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.849
Who's the editor-in-chief?

16:04.888 --> 16:06.219
Just hurry up and get rid of her!

16:06.757 --> 16:10.158
Ultimate attack!
WHITE MANUSCRIPT HELL!

16:18.602 --> 16:20.763
Next up is photocomposition!

16:24.808 --> 16:25.866
I can't move!

16:27.511 --> 16:30.378
Cut and paste!
Snip, snip...

16:31.715 --> 16:34.843
Wait a minute?
What are you planning to do?

16:34.885 --> 16:36.512
Make sure to get a good snipping of her!

16:36.820 --> 16:38.014
Hey!!

16:40.490 --> 16:42.253
DEAD SCREAM...

16:52.002 --> 16:53.526
Pluto.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.531
Leave the fighting to us.

16:56.940 --> 16:58.532
Uranus! Neptune!

16:59.076 --> 17:00.373
Thanks.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.537
Hurry up and get away from here!

17:03.146 --> 17:05.546
Sheesh, why do they
crop up one after another!?

17:09.219 --> 17:11.619
DEEP...

17:11.655 --> 17:13.122
...SUBMERGE!

17:16.226 --> 17:18.660
I'm all right even in sudden storms!

17:19.162 --> 17:20.527
I'm telling you to run!

17:20.564 --> 17:21.428
Why...?

17:21.465 --> 17:24.127
G nibs, round nibs, kabla nibs!

17:26.370 --> 17:27.894
Why? WHY!?

17:27.938 --> 17:29.462
- We're comrades, we're both Soldiers!
- You're in the way!

17:30.407 --> 17:32.307
MANUSCRIPT HELL!

17:34.845 --> 17:36.904
WORLD...

17:36.947 --> 17:39.313
...SHAKING!

17:43.086 --> 17:45.646
The sudden strength right before a deadline!

17:46.623 --> 17:48.648
Borderline... safe!

17:48.992 --> 17:51.153
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

17:55.265 --> 17:56.527
Sailor Venus!

17:56.566 --> 17:58.500
Sailor Mars!

17:58.535 --> 18:00.162
Sailor Jupiter!

18:00.737 --> 18:02.170
Sailor Mercury!

18:02.639 --> 18:05.335
The Sailor Team is here!

18:05.375 --> 18:06.467
W-When did they...?

18:06.510 --> 18:07.499
Guys!

18:07.544 --> 18:09.171
Uranus, guys...

18:09.212 --> 18:10.645
Tuxedo Mask!

18:10.681 --> 18:14.173
Our individual ability
might be inferior to you.

18:15.018 --> 18:18.215
But Sailor Moon has comrades
who combine their forces to fight...

18:19.690 --> 18:23.217
Sheesh, why do they all get together to...

18:23.260 --> 18:24.249
What should we do?

18:24.294 --> 18:26.819
Oh, geez, just get rid of
all of them as a bunch!

18:26.863 --> 18:28.797
But, if there are this many...

18:28.832 --> 18:30.993
What? You have your prized weapons!

18:31.034 --> 18:32.763
But I used up all of them...

18:32.803 --> 18:34.737
- You're no good!
- Now, Sailor Moon!

18:34.771 --> 18:35.362
Oh, okay!

18:37.607 --> 18:40.041
CRISIS...

18:40.110 --> 18:42.510
MAKE UP!

19:09.639 --> 19:13.541
RAINBOW...

19:13.577 --> 19:15.101
...MOON...

19:15.145 --> 19:17.773
...HEART ACHE!

19:24.054 --> 19:25.885
See ya. I'm leaving the rest to you.

19:25.922 --> 19:27.913
W-Wait a-- Wait!

19:30.560 --> 19:33.791
Stick to your deadlines!!

19:48.612 --> 19:50.204
Thanks, guys.

19:50.514 --> 19:54.575
I didn't want to help out someone
who ditches their study group...

19:55.619 --> 19:56.813
I apologize for that.

19:56.853 --> 19:59.879
If Chibiusa is with her friend, let's contact her.

19:59.923 --> 20:02.221
I'm sure she's worried right now.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.462
Oh, so you guys went to Crown Arcade.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.827
We had so much fun!

20:07.864 --> 20:11.630
You know, Hotaru had never
gone to an arcade before!

20:11.668 --> 20:16.230
You forgot that we were fighting, didn't you?

20:16.840 --> 20:19.468
Her family seems to be rather complicated...

20:19.509 --> 20:20.840
...but she seems like a good girl.

20:20.877 --> 20:25.007
Yeah. I want to be better friends with her!

20:25.315 --> 20:27.749
Hotaru...

20:30.749 --> 20:34.749
