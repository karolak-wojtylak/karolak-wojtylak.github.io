1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,333
The Messiah of Silence finally awakens!

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,273
Is defeating Hotaru the only way
to save humans from annihilation!?

3
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:12,975
No! I won't let that happen!

4
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:19,712
There has to be some way for everyone
to be happy without anyone getting hurt!!

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,662
Come, students.

6
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,434
To Mugen Academy.

7
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,668
Into our hands.

8
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,387
The winds are crying.

9
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,891
This planet is cowering at
the horrors of the unknown as well...

10
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,336
Chibiusa...

11
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,908
Hotaru...

12
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,908
Where did you go...?

13
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,452
Chibiusa...

14
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,585
Chibiusa.

15
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,061
You know, about Hotaru...

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,085
I'm sure she's all right--

17
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,495
Usagi!!

18
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:44,799
Usagi...

19
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,272
Oh, sorry.

20
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,374
I'll get you back!

21
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,638
How dare you!?

22
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,906
Fine!

23
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,914
I give up! I give up!

24
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,040
I won!

25
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,743
Here, take your towel.

26
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,716
Good night!

27
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,185
Don't catch a cold!

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,914
Yeah!

29
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,915
Hey, Usagi!

30
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,790
You know...

31
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,919
I'm worried about Hotaru,
but I'll cheer up.

32
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,919
Chibiusa...

33
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,692
Thanks!

34
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,926
Good night!

35
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,326
Good night...

36
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,803
Usagi.

37
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,370
The students of Mugen Academy
are gathering on campus.

38
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,935
It looks like something
is going to happen.

39
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,283
Chibiusa, I'm going to
go without telling you.

40
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,947
I'll make sure to bring Hotaru
back safe and sound.

41
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,687
Chibiusa...

42
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,925
This isn't good...

43
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,434
Hotaru's body is starting to weaken rapidly.

44
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,959
We urgently need pure hearts.

45
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,332
I have already finished the preparations.

46
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,140
I, Cyprin, the last and
greatest witch of the Witches 5...

47
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,738
...will do my best for you, Professor.

48
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,147
I'm counting on you, Cyprin.

49
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,846
Now, the only one I can rely on is you.

50
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,285
Leave it to me.

51
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,018
I am quite different from Kaorinite...

52
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,755
Do your best.

53
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,087
Professor... you're saying
the same thing to Cyprin...

54
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,257
Dammit, Cyprin...

55
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,944
F-Fine! I will get a hold of
the best pure heart there is!

56
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,775
Just you watch, Cyprin...

57
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,611
The best pure heart there is...

58
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,779
The target is that girl who Hotaru
has opened up to the most.

59
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,118
The heart of that girl named Chibiusa.

60
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,545
Chibiusa, help me!

61
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:11,806
Hotaru!

62
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,789
Hotaru!!

63
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,997
Hotaru...

64
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:35,472
The superior students of Mugen Academy...

65
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,843
Now is the time...

66
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:43,338
...to sacrifice your pure hearts
to us, the Death Busters.

67
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,583
The time has come.

68
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,583
Sacrifice your pure hearts...

69
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,889
...to the grand Death Busters.

70
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,455
That's right... your pure hearts.

71
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,437
Young ladies, outsiders are not
allowed to come onto school grounds!!

72
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:19,281
Then everyone,
please submit your pure hearts.

73
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,151
I have to get rid of those pests.

74
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,088
Upstairs...?

75
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,718
Yes...

76
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,428
This is...!?

77
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,561
Welcome, Sailor Soldiers.

78
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,003
Nice to meet you.

79
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,441
I'm Cyprin, the last and
greatest witch of the Witches 5.

80
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,936
I guess there's no need
to hide our identities.

81
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:48,948
Everyone, time to transform!

82
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,680
VENUS STAR POWER...

83
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,025
MERCURY STAR POWER...

84
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,295
MARS STAR POWER...

85
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,574
JUPITER STAR POWER...

86
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,816
MOON COSMIC POWER...

87
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,953
MAKE UP!

88
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:47,296
I will save this planet
with love and beauty!

89
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,942
I won't allow evil silence!
Take a cold shower and repent!

90
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,224
Those who tarnish pure hearts...

91
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,164
In the name of Mars,
I will chastise you!

92
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,699
I won't let you have
whatever you want!

93
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,542
I'll shock you so
much you'll regret it!

94
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:55,430
We, the sailor team,
will punish you in the name of the moon!

95
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,004
Soon, this planet will be
surrounded by silence.

96
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,071
We, the Death Busters, are victorious.

97
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,920
BURNING...

98
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,556
...MANDALA!

99
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,991
Did I get her?

100
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,925
Sailor Mars!

101
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,078
Sailor Mars!

102
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,081
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

103
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,673
I won't let you escape now!

104
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,909
You think you captured me with this?

105
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,181
What'd you--!

106
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,557
I'm Cyprin.

107
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,964
And I'm Petirol.

108
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,529
Two together to make one.

109
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,970
The one, and the same.

110
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,197
It doesn't matter if it's one or two!

111
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,208
Take this!

112
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,972
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

113
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:06,935
Petirol!

114
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,105
Cyprin!

115
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,040
Such a thing...

116
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,710
...has no effect...

117
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,685
...on us!!

118
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,111
Jupiter!

119
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,420
Oh, you just run around?

120
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,158
Sailor Soldiers really
aren't much, are they?

121
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,228
Hotaru...

122
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,631
Just you wait,
I'll make sure to save you.

123
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,296
MOON PRISM POWER...

124
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,669
MAKE UP!

125
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,638
I see... that brat is also a Sailor Soldier...

126
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,209
An unexpected harvest.

127
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,456
I'm not scared, I'm not scared...

128
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,160
Please wait for me, Hotaru...

129
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,076
Hotaru?

130
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,114
Hotaru wants to see you, too.

131
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:58,182
Hotaru wants to see you
and have your pure heart.

132
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,826
Tuxedo Mask!

133
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,091
The feelings of a girl for her friend.

134
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,090
A pathetic soldier with a heart
so frozen to not feel that warmth.

135
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,198
Take that!

136
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,470
Sailor Chibi Moon!

137
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,576
DEAD SCREAM...

138
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,213
Chibi Moon!

139
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,486
Oh, no!

140
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,529
It's mine... the best pure heart there is...

141
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,090
Sailor Chibi Moon...

142
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,937
SHINE AQUA...

143
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,202
...ILLUSION!

144
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,216
T-They're strong...

145
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,981
W-We have to do something...

146
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,454
Their teamwork is just too good.

147
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,719
If there is a way to separate those two...

148
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,316
Playtime is now over...

149
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,453
We'll be attacking for real now.

150
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,463
If you get hit with
the next one, you'll die!

151
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,857
We have to take a risk now!

152
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,924
All right!

153
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,025
Here we go!

154
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,763
Let's show them...

155
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:18,861
...our teamwork!

156
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,305
BUBBLE...

157
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,610
...SPRAY!

158
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,116
Blocking our vision?
How useless!

159
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,641
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

160
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,277
Petirol!

161
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,979
Cyprin!

162
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,290
MOON TIARA ACTION!

163
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,160
FIRE SOUL!

164
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,254
Your attacks do nothing against us!

165
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,859
We just absorb all that power,
and it just increases OUR power!

166
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,765
There!

167
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,168
Cyprin!

168
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:51,931
D-Damn you!!

169
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,235
Cyprin! Don't chase after them!

170
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,468
There!

171
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,239
Dammit!

172
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,240
I'm not letting you get away!

173
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,247
I won't let you escape!

174
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,981
Fool!

175
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,498
What!?

176
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,463
Cyprin!

177
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,299
Petirol!

178
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,682
We did it!

179
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,781
That was a tough opponent!

180
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,787
It's back to normal!

181
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,796
Look!

182
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,795
What in the world is this corridor!?

183
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,534
I sense a distortion
in space from this corridor.

184
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,477
It's connected to another dimension.

185
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,772
The headquarters
of the Death Busters!?

186
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:10,804
Let's go!

187
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:37,509
Welcome, young Sailor Soldiers.

188
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,505
So you finally showed up.

189
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,377
You are very lucky.

190
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,512
You get to participate in the
ceremony that is about to begin...

191
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,358
Sailor Chibi Moon!

192
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,255
Uranus!

193
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,225
Dammit!
He's got a strong barrier set up...

194
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,099
Uranus!

195
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,262
Neptune!

196
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,605
It seems as though
you all made it on time.

197
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,268
You are...?

198
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,266
Sailor Chibi Moon!!

199
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,379
Kaorinite.

200
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,608
Yes.

201
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,016
Soon, the Messiah of Silence will awaken.

202
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:24,887
Using the pure heart of this girl
named Chibiusa as her energy.

203
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,054
The pure heart...

204
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,928
Chibiusa!!

205
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,122
Stop it!

206
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,834
Sailor Moon!

207
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,314
The Messiah of Silence!!

208
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,850
No! Stop it!

209
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,792
Chibi Moon!

210
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,791
Chibi Moon!

211
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,642
H-Hotaru... I'm glad you're okay...

212
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:29,080
This... is horrible!

213
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,715
This is too horrible!!

214
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,685
Beautiful.

215
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,719
A pure heart fit for
the Messiah of Silence.

216
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,529
This is no good!

217
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,728
If Sailor Saturn revives,
this world will be destroyed!

218
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,463
Hotaru! Stop!!

219
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,999
Please! Stop her!
If you're Hotaru's dad...

220
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,945
...if you love Hotaru...

221
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,914
Please!

222
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,883
Love?

223
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,818
What do you mean?

224
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,995
Could it be...?

225
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,162
That's not Sailor Saturn!

226
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,697
What did you say!?

227
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:24,801
I am the Messiah of Silence...
Mistress Nine.

228
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:31,841
W-What's going on!?

229
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,785
She's not Sailor Saturn...!?

230
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,549
It's the Death Busters!

231
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:41,720
Hotaru was already possessed by
a powerful enemy, and it has awakened!

232
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,326
It is our victory, Professor!

233
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:49,061
Sorry to have troubled you, Kaorinite.

234
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,537
That thought is the greatest
reward for me, Professor!

235
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,970
I--!

236
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,740
Kaorinite's job is now over.

237
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,710
We will now start preparing
for the next step.

238
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,617
Yes!!

239
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,289
Chibiusa!!

240
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,258
Hurry!

241
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,761
This dimension will disappear soon!!

242
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,771
W-What in the world is this!?

243
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,777
Usagi's group is still inside...

244
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,815
Sailor Moon...!

245
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,281
Chibiusa!?

246
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:43,822
Mamo-chan!

247
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,848
Chibiusa...
Chibiusa isn't breathing!!

248
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,654
What?!

249
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,659
Small Lady!?

250
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,829
There were students inside the building!

251
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,595
Don't worry, we evacuated them already.

252
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,659
Hurry!

253
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:08,072
We linked Mamoru and Chibiusa's bodies.

254
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,673
We'll keep Chibiusa alive
using Mamoru's life force.

255
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,918
This is the best that
we can do for now.

256
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,256
What have we been
fighting for all along?

257
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,690
Getting Chibiusa into a mess like this...

258
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,192
Setsuna!

259
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:27,731
I will head towards Mugen
Academy with Uranus' group.

260
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,098
To defeat the Messiah of Silence.

261
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,625
Are you still saying that!?

262
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,901
The Messiah of Silence is Hotaru!!

263
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,774
There is no other way
to save Small Lady.

264
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:44,011
No way... I don't want any
more people to be unhappy.

265
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,485
Hotaru, Chibiusa... everyone else.

266
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,680
I don't want to see anyone else's tears!!

267
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,986
Usako...

268
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,756
We have to do whatever we can do.

269
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,728
We need to fight.

270
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,762
Fight for the things that we believe in...

271
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:14,762
