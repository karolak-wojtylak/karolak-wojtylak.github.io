1
00:00:01,982 --> 00:00:05,679
Dear Usagi, how are
you feeling lately?

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,984
I'm so jealous...
I want to see Mamo-chan, too...

3
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:11,490
Yup, I decided to go back there!

4
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:13,891
See ya. From Chibiusa.

5
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:15,690
What IS this!?

6
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:20,393
Such a selfish little daughter will
be punished in the name of the moon!

7
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,860
Yes, this is the Witches 5...

8
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:09,928
Yes, please hold on a moment.

9
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:13,641
Yes, this is Eugeal.

10
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:14,802
It's me.

11
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:17,335
I have looked through your reports...

12
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,313
How were they?

13
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:21,080
They are rather well done.

14
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:22,811
Thank you very much.

15
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:26,077
I've already found yet another
person with a pure heart...

16
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:28,487
...our next candidate
for the talisman.

17
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:30,822
Nothing less from you, Eugeal.

18
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:40,831
Our target is a girl famous for
her skills with the Japanese drum.

19
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:44,734
I believe that this girl's
pure heart is a talisman.

20
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:46,798
Yes. I am trusting you with this...

21
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:51,336
I guess we should alter our methods
from now on, as per your reports.

22
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:57,249
I will assign a Daimohn befitting
this target as your bodyguard...

23
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:26,514
SOYER!

24
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:01,549
Hey, hey! Guys!

25
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,746
Why don't we all go to
the Juban Festival tonight?

26
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:06,049
Oh, that's a good idea!

27
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:07,055
Don't you think so?

28
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:09,785
Then we can all look sharp
in our summer kimonos...

29
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:11,520
- Yup, yup! Yup, yup!
- Yup, yup! Yup, yup!

30
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:16,325
Ami, it's all right if we take
a small breather today... right?

31
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:20,699
Yeah, yeah! Our study group
already was canceled for today...

32
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:23,537
I guess so...

33
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:25,563
Taking it easy once in
a while can be a good thing.

34
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:27,097
Yippee!

35
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:31,235
But anyway, I wonder
what's up with Rei...

36
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,216
Why did she want to cancel the study
group at the Hikawa Shrine today...?

37
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:37,943
I wonder if something happened...

38
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:57,036
It's Rei...

39
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:58,004
Sure is...

40
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:00,098
Oh, Miss Hino!

41
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:02,838
I'm sorry that I'm so late!

42
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,575
It's all right.
I just got here myself...

43
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:16,891
It's a girl...

44
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:20,361
Who said that it HAD to be a date...?

45
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:24,025
You can't tell from just appearances.
There are cases like Haruka, you know.

46
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:28,400
Then, she's the opposite of Haruka, and
is actually a guy dressing up as a girl!?

47
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:30,428
It sure doesn't look that way...

48
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:35,438
I have no idea what they
are talking about from here.

49
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:37,138
Um...

50
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,612
How is it?

51
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:40,512
Well... Let's see...

52
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:43,985
Please! You just HAVE
to help us, Miss Tohno...

53
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:47,182
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Who ordered the house blend?

54
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:48,189
Oh, I did.

55
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,500
M-Miss?

56
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:10,137
Was it just me...?

57
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,711
Miss?

58
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:23,989
Miss...

59
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:36,162
Hot! HOT!!

60
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,105
My head, my head!

61
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,472
Why in the world are all of YOU here!?

62
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:42,101
Miss Hino...

63
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:43,975
Yes?

64
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:46,503
That offer of yours...
I will accept it.

65
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:48,140
Really!?

66
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:49,172
Yes...

67
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:50,515
It'd be my pleasure.

68
00:05:52,154 --> 00:05:56,147
Oh, no, the pleasure is all mine.

69
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:09,495
Juban Festival Promotion Committee?

70
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:10,630
What's that?

71
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,037
Just like it says.

72
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:14,770
It's a group of people trying to make
the festival a little bit more exciting.

73
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,506
I take it that you're a member
of this committee, Rei.

74
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:19,377
But why you, Rei?

75
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:23,510
One of Grandpa's friends
begged me into doing it.

76
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:28,046
Sure, that's what you say,
but I'm sure you volunteered to do it!

77
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,820
Rei, you like festivals and stuff!

78
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:32,349
Like what just happened...

79
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:34,919
You guys caused all that!

80
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,691
Now, now...
Mistakes happen to everyone.

81
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:41,931
They say that water-goblins
get upset stomachs.

82
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,933
You mean, "Even water-goblins
drown in the river."

83
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:52,341
I'm just glad Miss Tohno
is a kind person.

84
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:54,281
Who was that girl?

85
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:55,908
Now listen up!

86
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:58,511
That was Miss Maya Tohno.

87
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:00,988
She's an prodigious player
of the Japanese drums!

88
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:02,615
Japanese drums...

89
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,888
In other words, Rei --
you were negotiating...

90
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:07,122
...with her to come play
for the Juban Festival.

91
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:10,490
Correct! If Miss Tohno could
beat the drums for us...

92
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:14,161
The Juban Festival
would be more exciting.

93
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:15,670
Hey, Rei...

94
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:17,569
Let me beat on the drum too!

95
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:21,838
There isn't a drum that
you can beat on, Usagi.

96
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:23,003
Oh, wait...

97
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:25,707
Usagi, there IS one drum
that even you can beat on.

98
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:26,941
Really!?

99
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:45,956
Goldfish! How about
scooping for goldfish!?

100
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:49,831
Goldfish! It's the goldfish scoop!

101
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:56,473
Why do we have to watch over
the goldfish scooping booth...?

102
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:59,875
That drum looks pretty
good on you, Usagi.

103
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:01,780
Then change places with me.

104
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:03,079
I'll pass.

105
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:06,986
Usagi, you said that you
wanted to beat on the drums.

106
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:09,483
Yeah...

107
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:10,923
This one looks strong.

108
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,948
Thanks!

109
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:12,983
See...

110
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:16,590
Be gentle...

111
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:21,231
You two...
You're ruining the business...

112
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,931
Missus!

113
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,563
We'll try scooping goldfish!

114
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:25,664
Can you give us scoops?

115
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:28,642
We're customers! Customers!

116
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:30,611
Missus... huh?

117
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,881
Here you go!

118
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:42,384
Business, business...

119
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,725
Goldfish!

120
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,125
Goldfish!

121
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,628
Buns-head?

122
00:08:58,273 --> 00:08:59,297
Haruka!

123
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:01,639
Michiru!

124
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:03,137
Good evening.

125
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:05,442
What's this? Are all of
you on a part-time job?

126
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,811
Well... I guess...

127
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:10,215
I know, why don't you two
try scooping some goldfish?

128
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:11,981
Try the goldfish scoop!

129
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,352
All right... just a little bit.

130
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,321
I guess so...

131
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:16,551
Please, please!

132
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:29,535
Yeah...

133
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:31,766
Aren't you glad we
got a cute goldfish...?

134
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:34,275
Oh? Cute...?

135
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:37,975
What, are you jealous?

136
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:40,447
Perhaps...

137
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:44,713
They look so sharp,
no matter what they do!

138
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:46,812
All right!
I'll try it out once myseIf!

139
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:58,333
Huh? Was it just me?

140
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,854
There she is...

141
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:37,100
Rei!

142
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:38,603
Usagi...

143
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,201
Rei, how much longer do we
have to watch over the booth--

144
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,045
Miss Tohno?

145
00:10:58,994 --> 00:10:59,961
Miss Tohno...

146
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:04,056
...has been practicing like
that for the past three hours!

147
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:06,567
I told her that she didn't
have to go that far...

148
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,899
...because we're not paying
her for this performance...

149
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:12,232
But she said that she can't
beat the drum right...

150
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:14,765
...unless she gets excited
by practicing like that.

151
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,756
I thought about it when
I saw Miss Tohno's drumming...

152
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:38,426
...that the Juban festival is sure to
be a success if she participates in it.

153
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:39,759
But I...

154
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:42,929
...I guess I was a little
too unfair about it.

155
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:47,868
Even amazing people like Miss Tohno
work so hard behind the scenes...

156
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,206
Rei...

157
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:51,838
I have to do MY best to
make the festival more fun!

158
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,938
Yeah!

159
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:57,275
Let's crank up the fun factor,
and surprise everyone!

160
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:00,015
All right, we're going to
make sure this is a blast!

161
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:02,285
Yeah!

162
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,268
I have received information that
the target is in this vicinity...

163
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:18,829
I guess I have no choice...
I'll call out for her.

164
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:25,105
Um, um... Test, test, test...

165
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:27,341
What's that car?

166
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,914
Miss Maya Tohno. Miss Maya Tohno,
please show yourself if you are here.

167
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:37,584
Miss Maya Tohno. Miss Maya Tohno,
please show yourself if you are here.

168
00:12:42,831 --> 00:12:43,820
There she is!

169
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:56,569
Captured!

170
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,987
Miss Tohno's heart crystal...!

171
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:07,579
Let's transform!

172
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:08,350
Yeah!

173
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,586
MOON COSMIC POWER...

174
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:16,153
...MAKE UP!

175
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:49,892
MARS STAR POWER...

176
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:52,456
...MAKE UP!

177
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,979
I will now go ahead
and take the crystal...

178
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,282
Hold it right there!

179
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:17,423
Those who are after the pure heart
devoted to the Japanese drum...

180
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,791
....are all enemies of the
Japanese traditional arts!

181
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:21,595
For love and justice...

182
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,791
The pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

183
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:29,797
Sailor Moon!

184
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:35,039
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

185
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:36,341
Just as she said...

186
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:40,007
For love and fire,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

187
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:43,016
Sailor Mars!

188
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:46,543
I'll chastise you in the name of Mars!

189
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:47,810
I see...

190
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,825
So you are the Sailor Soldiers...

191
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,051
I am one of the Witches 5.

192
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:55,084
I am Eugeal!

193
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,392
Witches 5?

194
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:58,399
Eugeal?

195
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:01,561
Appear before me, Daimohn!

196
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:17,642
Soyer!

197
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,283
Get rid of those that get in our way!

198
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:45,675
You gotta dance!

199
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:54,447
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Uranus...

200
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:56,855
...acts with elegance!

201
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,655
Also guided by a new era,
Sailor Neptune...

202
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:02,856
...acts with grace!

203
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:07,064
Hey! Don't you dare touch MY
crystal without my permission!

204
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:10,094
I know this is your all-important first
battle, but it looks like a loss for you.

205
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:11,105
What?!

206
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,367
Too bad.

207
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:15,103
This isn't a talisman...

208
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,747
Dammit!

209
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:20,611
Soyer!

210
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:24,277
I'm trusting you to
take care of the rest!

211
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:31,048
You're not going to help them today?

212
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:34,255
If I help them every time, I would be
providing them with too much support...

213
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:35,626
That's true.

214
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:49,877
Now, I think it is about time...

215
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:50,969
...to beat on this drum!

216
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,307
By a drum...

217
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:55,976
...do you mean US?

218
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:02,248
Here we go!

219
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:06,123
Please, try her out first!

220
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,458
What are you saying!?

221
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:10,259
Because that looks like it'll HURT!

222
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,494
Hold it right there!

223
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,336
Who is it this time!?

224
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,967
You really are worthless without me!

225
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,706
You should really
hold yourself together!

226
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,839
T-That voice...

227
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:33,710
For love and justice, an apprentice
to a pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

228
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:36,315
Sailor Chibi Moon!

229
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:38,848
In the name of the moon
from the future...

230
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:41,123
...I'll punish you!

231
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:44,093
Chibiusa?

232
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:46,862
All right! I'll get rid of YOU first!

233
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:51,699
PINK SUGAR...

234
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:55,675
...HEART ATTACK!

235
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:07,252
That's strange...

236
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,755
Ouch...

237
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:13,158
What's the matter?

238
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:15,259
PINK SUGAR...

239
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:18,094
...HEART ATTACK!

240
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,468
There!

241
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:38,280
Now, Sailor Moon!

242
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,703
MOON SPIRAL...

243
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:07,204
...HEART ATTACK!

244
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:20,157
LOVELY!

245
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:44,642
Usagi! I can't see well!
Do something about it!

246
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:47,678
You sure have an attitude for
someone getting a piggyback ride!

247
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:50,418
Oh, she's a cute girl...

248
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,756
Oh, thanks...

249
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:55,524
That girl... Don't you think
she looks like you, buns-head?

250
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:57,190
We don't look alike at all!

251
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:59,358
She's just my cousin.

252
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,833
Everyone!

253
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:05,402
We would now like to start Miss Maya
Tohno's Japanese drum performance.

254
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,102
Miss Tohno, please go ahead.

255
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:18,741
By the way, Chibiusa...
Why did you come back over here?

256
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:23,189
My mom told me to get some
training in the 20th century.

257
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:27,225
What does that mean!?

258
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:34,225
