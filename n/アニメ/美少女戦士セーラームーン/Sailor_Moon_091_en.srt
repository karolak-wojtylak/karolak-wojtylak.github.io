1
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:05,641
What in the world are you?

2
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:08,120
Are you enemies? Or allies?

3
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:11,283
If you are soldiers as well,
fight with us!

4
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:15,726
I can't forgive those that
stomp on pure hearts!

5
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:20,426
I, Sailor Moon, will punish
you with a new attack!

6
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:29,335
Kaorinite...

7
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:32,670
Yes, Professor.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,940
What is the purpose of
our group, Death Busters?

9
00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:40,572
To acquire the holy grail
and control the world.

10
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:46,582
And how are we going to
get the holy grail?

11
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,117
If we find the three talismans that are
within the pure hearts of the chosen ones...

12
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,593
...we will know the whereabouts
of the holy grail.

13
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:59,462
That is right. For that, we must
first use the Daimohn eggs to...

14
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:28,819
Now, find the pure heart
that is just right for you!

15
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:13,002
Why!?

16
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:20,110
The light from the Silver
Crystal is disappearing...

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,407
Oh, my, tired from studying?

18
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:24,041
Or did you work too hard?

19
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,279
Or you didn't get your afternoon nap?

20
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,449
Usagi, shouldn't you retire soon?

21
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:34,418
You... all of you are traitors!

22
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,630
- I won't forgive you!
- I-I can't breathe!

23
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:41,133
You... you... you... you...

24
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:45,668
A dream...?

25
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:48,640
Really, Usagi...

26
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:53,306
It's not a dream...

27
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:57,442
If the light doesn't come back, I might
not be able to transform again...

28
00:02:57,484 --> 00:02:58,917
Usagi...

29
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:03,719
Luna... Does it mean I have to
retire from being a Sailor Soldier?

30
00:03:03,757 --> 00:03:05,384
That's not true...

31
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:08,558
But the Silver Crystal...

32
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:12,156
I-It'll be all right!
I'm sure everything will be all right!

33
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:14,767
Cheer up, Usagi!

34
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,462
Oh, that's right!

35
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:19,995
Why don't you talk
this out with Mamoru?

36
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,098
But...

37
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:23,041
Now, cheer up! Come on now!

38
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:30,777
You had a dream like that?

39
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,175
Mamo-chan...

40
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,780
I wonder what's going
to happen to me now...

41
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:41,417
If I can't transform,
I can't fight against the new enemy...

42
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:51,134
I know! I'll show you
something good, Usako.

43
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:55,064
Just come with me...

44
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:12,124
It's okay, come on!

45
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:15,622
I-Is it all right to go
into a place like this?

46
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,127
I don't think it's all right, but...

47
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,130
Nobody's around...

48
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,138
Oh, Mamo-chan!

49
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:28,504
Just because you wanted
to be alone with me...

50
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,635
You didn't have to bring
me to a place like this!

51
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:34,538
Don't jump to conclusions!

52
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:38,176
It's all right! Come on! You don't
have to be shy about it! Okay!

53
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:45,015
My, how cute!

54
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:47,652
Let me hold it!

55
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:50,629
Good girl. Because you're brown...

56
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:52,962
Your name is Char-chan!

57
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,190
There, there.

58
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:57,226
Mamo-chan, you wanted
to show me this kitten?

59
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,205
Yeah. This is where stray cats live.

60
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:04,710
Where are you going, Char-chan?

61
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,203
You too, Mamo-chan! Hurry!

62
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,215
H-Hey...! Sheesh.

63
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:12,215
Now, eat up!

64
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:19,217
Don't rush...
There is still plenty left.

65
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:22,221
Are you taking care of those cats?

66
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:24,489
Who is it?

67
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,995
Defenders of justice!

68
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:30,866
Nice to meet you!

69
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:40,840
Let me join you!
Doyou always feed the cats?

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,179
Yeah, but I feel sorry for them...

71
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:48,677
I finally found this place, but
it's going to be demolished soon...

72
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:52,254
They all want to be happy, but...

73
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:54,123
You're kind...

74
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,559
All right!

75
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:58,462
I'll take care of the cats too!

76
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:00,159
Is that all right, Mamo-chan?

77
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,164
Well, I guess it's all right
if it'll cheer you up.

78
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:40,305
Taking care of cats!?

79
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,208
Not just taking care of them!
I have to find the cats' new owners!

80
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:48,943
Rei, Ami, Minako, Mako-chan...

81
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:54,443
Four cats will be taken care
of when you each take one...

82
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:59,618
Wait a minute. I barely get
by taking care of Artemis!

83
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,957
What doyou mean by that?!

84
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:03,462
Don't worry about it. Don't worry.

85
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:05,857
Our place too...

86
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,298
See, we have a lot of birds.

87
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:11,064
I can't possibly have a cat here.

88
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:14,833
Um...

89
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:18,742
I'm living by myself. I don't
think I can take care of a cat.

90
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:23,243
I'm facing important entrance exams...

91
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:26,252
I don't think I am at ease
enough to take care of a cat...

92
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:30,386
What, what's all this!?
You guys only think about yourselves!

93
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:33,756
Then why can't you take care of
them all at your place, Usagi?

94
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,156
Well, um...

95
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:39,995
I have a reason why I can't!

96
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:43,935
We barely get by feeding
Luna's giant stomach!

97
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,201
Who has a giant stomach!?

98
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:51,873
Anyway, don't rush. Why don't you look
for people who might take care of them?

99
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:57,842
All right. Then, for now, we'll each get
some food for the cats, and meet up again.

100
00:07:57,884 --> 00:07:59,351
Got that!?

101
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:00,852
What's going on?

102
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,287
She's just being whimsical, as always.

103
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:09,786
No, don't follow me.

104
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:14,524
I'm sorry...
I can't keep any cats here...

105
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:20,267
Only until Mom comes home...

106
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:26,136
Keep yourselves out of trouble!

107
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:28,841
Don't climb on the bed!

108
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:30,008
Hey now!

109
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,040
I'm in the middle of this...

110
00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:33,845
Now...

111
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:35,548
Was it here?

112
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:45,623
NEKONNELL!

113
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:48,764
T-This is a joke, right?

114
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:57,266
I will take the talisman
inside your pure heart now-NELL!

115
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:01,543
Run!

116
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:04,779
I won't let you get away! NELL NELL!

117
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,839
I wonder if she's not
going to come today...

118
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,772
There, there. Char-chan.

119
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:10,249
They make me want to ask Grandpa
and see if I can keep one of them.

120
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:13,878
Don't say one, take all of them!

121
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:18,079
Usagi, this isn't a bargain
sale at a supermarket.

122
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:19,182
Oh, sorry.

123
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:32,703
W-What's wrong?

124
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:36,205
What's going on?

125
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:45,746
NELL NELL NELL!

126
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,191
A Daimohn again...

127
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:05,237
Just maybe... I might be able to...

128
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:08,230
MOON CRYSTAL POWER...

129
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,242
...MAKE UP!

130
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:12,668
U-Usagi...

131
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:13,406
Usagi...

132
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:20,819
Let's go, everyone!

133
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:24,217
MARS STAR POWER...

134
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:26,782
...MAKE UP!

135
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:30,087
JUPITER STAR POWER...

136
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,654
...MAKE UP!

137
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,198
MERCURY STAR POWER...

138
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:38,760
...MAKE UP!

139
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:41,899
VENUS STAR POWER...

140
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,136
...MAKE UP!

141
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:17,973
This time, I will
take the talisman, NELL!

142
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,637
We won't let you do that!

143
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:25,648
The Sailor Soldiers are here!

144
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,041
What?

145
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:31,789
BURNING...

146
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:37,119
...MANDALA!

147
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,127
SPARKLING...

148
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:41,395
...WIDE PRESSURE!

149
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:52,777
T-They're all...

150
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:53,744
Stop!

151
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,337
Wait!

152
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,109
Usagi!

153
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:04,620
Nobody else will get
in the way now! NELL!

154
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:09,859
NELL NELL NELL!

155
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:26,434
Now I have a souvenir to bring
to lady Kaorinite! NELL!

156
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:30,940
What is it? NELLLLLLLLL!

157
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:43,955
Such a powerless being.

158
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,995
It's those two again!

159
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:53,363
How is it?

160
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:54,998
This is not a talisman...

161
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,512
Who in the world... are they?

162
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:21,090
Wait!

163
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:24,428
We haven't defeated the enemy yet!

164
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,869
If you are soldiers as well...

165
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:28,100
...fight with us!

166
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,664
Don't get the wrong idea!

167
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,576
Our mission is only
to acquire the talismans...

168
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:35,080
There's no way we can fight with you!

169
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:39,676
You should settle your
own affairs by yourselves.

170
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:46,590
What!?

171
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:57,363
Everyone!

172
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,811
Who the NELL is it?

173
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:12,883
Tuxedo Mask!

174
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:19,589
Those who toy with pure hearts will
someday be tried by pure hearts!

175
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,622
NEKONNELL!

176
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:40,575
What...!?

177
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:51,947
Tuxedo Mask!

178
00:15:51,991 --> 00:15:54,118
Run, Usako!

179
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:03,164
Now! Usako, at least you
should get away from here!

180
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:06,000
I can't do that!

181
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:07,667
Hurry and run!

182
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:08,537
No...

183
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:11,202
I want to protect everyone...!

184
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:13,268
And my dear Mamo-chan too...

185
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:16,275
I will fight with everyone...

186
00:16:16,882 --> 00:16:18,281
Usako...

187
00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:20,786
Usagi...

188
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:38,865
T-That's...

189
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:18,705
This, born from our
combined power, is...?

190
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:21,745
The legendary rod...

191
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:24,716
Spiral Heart Moon Rod...

192
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:30,312
The legendary Spiral Heart Moon Rod?

193
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:33,189
NEKONNELL!

194
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:39,554
Usagi! Transform!

195
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:41,395
I'm sure you can do it now!!

196
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:50,001
MOON COSMIC POWER...

197
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:52,476
...MAKE UP!!

198
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:27,335
I won't forgive you for
trampling pure hearts underfoot!

199
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:29,238
For love and justice...

200
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:31,613
...the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

201
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,345
Sailor Moon!

202
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:38,620
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

203
00:19:01,113 --> 00:19:04,708
MOON SPIRAL...

204
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:08,478
...HEART...

205
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:10,682
...ATTACK!

206
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:19,858
Lovely!

207
00:19:32,444 --> 00:19:33,968
I did it!

208
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:35,844
I was able to transform!

209
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:38,179
That was splendid, Sailor Moon...

210
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:43,382
This is our...

211
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,430
I'm glad, so glad.

212
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:55,931
But it's going to be tough from now on.

213
00:19:56,335 --> 00:20:00,203
Yeah. We're going to
find owners for the cats.

214
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:02,437
I already found them.

215
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:04,840
5 cats go to Rei...

216
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:08,938
Two to Ami, two more to Minako,
and one to Mako-chan!

217
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:12,644
I've been saying that
you can't do that!

218
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:18,450
I'm not a cat!

219
00:20:20,826 --> 00:20:23,454
We can have them taken care
of at the Animal Kingdom!

220
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:27,830
Why didn't you think of that earlier?

221
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:32,462
This is no good...

222
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:39,462
