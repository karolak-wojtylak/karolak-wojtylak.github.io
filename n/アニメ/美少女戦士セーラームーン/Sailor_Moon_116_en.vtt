00:01.700 --> 00:04.362
A beautiful flower has thorns...

00:04.403 --> 00:07.031
Just kidding -- I didn't mean me!

00:07.072 --> 00:09.563
A rose always comes with thorns.

00:09.608 --> 00:12.543
But the flower is beautiful
and calms the spirit down!

00:12.578 --> 00:15.570
Hey, you over there who stomps
down on such feelings for flowers!

00:15.614 --> 00:19.983
I, Sailor Moon, will punish you
in the name of the moon!

00:33.000 --> 00:34.331
How about this?

00:34.601 --> 00:36.569
It's cute!

00:36.603 --> 00:39.071
Mamo-chan, thank you!

00:40.541 --> 00:43.169
Why is Chibiusa the only
one who gets all the stuff!.?

00:43.210 --> 00:46.145
I can't help it.
It's because she has a picnic.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.272
Yeah, yeah!

00:47.314 --> 00:49.077
Why are you agreeing, Luna?

00:49.116 --> 00:53.075
Sheesh, it's no use taking
such a petty thing out on Luna...

00:53.120 --> 00:54.178
That's right!

00:54.221 --> 00:56.416
I'm not a backpack...

00:56.457 --> 01:01.156
I know! Mamo-chan, let's go on
a picnic, too! Just the two of us!

01:01.495 --> 01:03.087
Oh, come on... Come on!

01:03.130 --> 01:04.529
No fair!

01:04.565 --> 01:06.931
- Me, too, me, too! Me, too!!
- Let's go, Mamo-chan! Let's go, Mamo-chan!

01:06.967 --> 01:08.798
Hey, now...

01:12.406 --> 01:15.102
All right, all right!

01:22.816 --> 01:24.545
Oh, Hotaru!

01:26.386 --> 01:28.047
Wait, Hotaru!

01:29.323 --> 01:30.312
Don't run away...

01:30.357 --> 01:32.791
We're friends, right!?

01:32.826 --> 01:34.589
Friends...?

01:34.628 --> 01:36.789
That's right!
We are... right!?

01:37.364 --> 01:39.889
Chibiusa...

01:42.035 --> 01:43.002
That girl...

01:43.036 --> 01:45.630
She must have some big
reason behind all this...

01:45.672 --> 01:49.267
Haruka also said that I shouldn't
let Chibiusa near that girl, too...

01:49.309 --> 01:52.801
But she's not a bad girl!
She can't be! Right?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.077
Hotaru...

02:06.860 --> 02:09.590
Release my powers!

02:10.097 --> 02:11.758
Hurry!

02:11.798 --> 02:14.596
Can you not hear the voices
of time calling for me!?

02:14.868 --> 02:19.271
Let us hurry,
using the pure hearts of humans...

02:24.545 --> 02:25.443
You are...?

02:25.479 --> 02:29.176
Um... Please, give this to Hotaru!

02:30.117 --> 02:32.608
Good-bye!

02:37.891 --> 02:39.882
Kaori, that...?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.385
It's that girl again...

02:42.429 --> 02:44.624
She told me to give this to you, Hotaru...

02:47.367 --> 02:50.996
"Hotaru, let's go on a picnic tomorrow."

02:51.038 --> 02:56.442
"I'll make plenty of lunch!
So, Hotaru, you come with this backpack!

02:56.476 --> 02:58.137
From Chibiusa."

02:58.478 --> 03:00.378
So selfish...

03:00.414 --> 03:03.508
She knows that you're a frail girl, too.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.381
How wonderful!

03:05.752 --> 03:07.720
Papa...

03:07.754 --> 03:11.918
Since I can't spend much time
with you with all of my research...

03:11.959 --> 03:14.393
You go and have as
much fun as you want.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.899
We're going now!

03:24.204 --> 03:25.262
Is this all food...?

03:25.305 --> 03:28.502
Yeah! I got up early to make it all!

03:28.542 --> 03:30.908
Will it fit in the trunk...?

03:34.781 --> 03:38.012
Hotaru can't come after all, I guess...

03:38.051 --> 03:39.916
Chibiusa!

03:41.655 --> 03:42.849
Hotaru!

03:46.126 --> 03:49.027
You can come to the picnic!

04:00.574 --> 04:03.042
This place is huge!

04:03.343 --> 04:05.208
Woohoo!

04:05.245 --> 04:08.043
Hotaru! Usagi! Hurry, hurry!

04:08.248 --> 04:10.045
Wait for me, Chibiusa!

04:25.532 --> 04:27.124
Ready, set, toss!

04:27.167 --> 04:28.828
Tie, set, toss!

04:28.869 --> 04:30.234
Tie, set, toss!

04:33.740 --> 04:36.709
I told them to not get near her...

04:36.743 --> 04:40.235
Are you saying she has something to
do with our enemy, the Death Busters?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.978
I'm not sure... but I have
a bad feeling about this.

04:44.017 --> 04:47.248
I feel the presence of
something tremendously evil.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.588
But... it looks fun...

04:56.430 --> 04:57.419
Are you all right?

04:58.231 --> 04:59.926
Y-Yes...

05:04.538 --> 05:07.200
A graduate of my school works here.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.437
He's a botanist, with his lifework
being his research on roses.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.311
Wait, Chibiusa!

05:12.346 --> 05:13.938
Catch me if you can, Usagi!
You're slower than a tortoise!

05:13.980 --> 05:14.947
You did that on purpose, didn't you!?

05:22.255 --> 05:23.688
Yes, Professor?

05:23.957 --> 05:27.449
Mimet, what is your
favorite color for roses?

05:27.494 --> 05:31.954
Oh, my...! If I could have any,
it would be a million red roses...!

05:35.235 --> 05:40.195
Improving and breeding of roses is a job
that requires good sense and patience!

05:40.240 --> 05:45.007
There apparently is a botanist with
good results in that field, I take it?

05:47.614 --> 05:51.516
That MUST be an owner of a pure heart!

05:58.725 --> 06:01.057
The target has been determined.

06:01.094 --> 06:05.724
All right... Let me make a
Daimohn most suited for that man.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.825
I'm counting on you.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.580
Ubara!

06:53.013 --> 06:54.605
- Amazing...
- This is beautiful!

06:54.648 --> 06:56.843
There are so many of them!

07:02.355 --> 07:04.687
Yo! Is that you, Mamoru?

07:04.724 --> 07:05.656
Sir!

07:05.692 --> 07:06.784
How've you been?

07:06.827 --> 07:09.352
You've still got beautiful women with you!

07:09.830 --> 07:10.854
"Still"...?

07:10.897 --> 07:12.956
I-It's a joke!

07:12.999 --> 07:13.863
Sir!

07:14.768 --> 07:16.793
Papa!

07:16.837 --> 07:19.397
Mama's lunch!

07:19.439 --> 07:20.736
The main dish is a croquet?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.766
- You're right!
- Correct!

07:24.544 --> 07:26.444
So many...

07:26.480 --> 07:28.380
There's even more of them...

07:29.416 --> 07:30.849
Oh, Professor!

07:30.884 --> 07:33.876
You have to use proper
sense to choose the targets!

07:40.560 --> 07:41.390
And stop!

07:42.128 --> 07:44.619
From here, you will help Mama back home!

07:44.664 --> 07:45.824
Okay!

07:45.866 --> 07:46.833
Don't trip!

07:46.867 --> 07:49.358
Bye bye!

07:50.604 --> 07:52.401
You're kidding...!

08:00.981 --> 08:02.972
It's a croquet!

08:04.084 --> 08:06.609
How goes the research
for new types of roses?

08:06.653 --> 08:09.781
Oh, I think I'm almost there!

08:09.823 --> 08:12.519
Hotaru, don't be bashful and eat up!

08:12.559 --> 08:13.355
Okay.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.354
Here!

08:16.563 --> 08:19.191
Chibiusa! You have to eat
the bell peppers, too!

08:19.232 --> 08:21.325
Mamo-chan isn't eating them, either!

08:21.368 --> 08:22.392
What was that?

08:22.435 --> 08:24.801
Mamo-chan! Eat! You have to eat!

08:24.838 --> 08:26.533
But, you know...

08:26.573 --> 08:27.733
EAT!

08:27.774 --> 08:30.971
All right, I understand...

08:31.244 --> 08:32.973
Now it's your turn, Chibiusa!

08:33.013 --> 08:34.480
EAT!

08:34.514 --> 08:36.482
A-All right!

08:39.786 --> 08:42.846
Hotaru, you don't think the lunch is yummy?

08:42.889 --> 08:43.878
It's not that...

08:43.924 --> 08:48.486
I was just thinking how I haven't eaten
like this with Papa in quite a while...

08:54.968 --> 08:57.528
There are times when
adults are hellishly busy.

08:57.571 --> 09:02.133
It's more fun to spend that time playing with
your friends than to complain about it!

09:02.175 --> 09:03.506
Right!?

09:08.715 --> 09:11.343
What are you doing, Chibiusa...!?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.651
Better! That guy is much better!!

09:23.730 --> 09:25.391
Appear, Dai--

09:28.335 --> 09:31.463
I'm counting on you, Mimet.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.869
P-Professor!

09:55.061 --> 10:00.158
Almost every variety of rose growing in
Japan are planted in this greenhouse!

10:00.200 --> 10:02.600
Amazing... and they're all so beautiful!

10:03.937 --> 10:05.370
Are you tired?

10:05.405 --> 10:06.099
No...

10:06.773 --> 10:08.001
They're beautiful, aren't they?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.475
Other than these, many
different types of roses have...

10:10.510 --> 10:12.944
...been grown thanks to
improvements made to them.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.970
Improvements...!

10:16.249 --> 10:20.447
It's hard to believe that an old man
like him improved these...

10:22.756 --> 10:26.624
It would be better to just let it go free, and
let it bloom wherever it wanted to bloom...

10:27.127 --> 10:29.322
Hotaru...

10:29.929 --> 10:34.025
These are tropical plants.
Come over here.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.226
Let's go!

10:36.269 --> 10:37.998
I'm tired... You can go on ahead.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.207
Um...

10:51.251 --> 10:55.085
Can you tell me the name of this flower?

10:55.121 --> 10:58.147
- Oh, I don't know...
- You should ask the researcher over there!

10:58.525 --> 11:02.052
Oh, I totally thought that
HE was the researcher...

11:03.329 --> 11:06.423
You look so intelligent!

11:06.466 --> 11:09.958
If you don't mind, how about we
have a conversation in private?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.561
I'm sorry...

11:11.604 --> 11:14.038
But I'm here to spend time with my family.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.107
O-Oh, are they your sisters?

11:18.144 --> 11:20.874
No, they're my future wife and child.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.040
Now, excuse me...

11:23.817 --> 11:25.648
W-What was that!?

11:25.685 --> 11:28.051
Fine, I will have to take
the pure heart by force...!

11:32.192 --> 11:34.683
The heart of the botanist...

11:34.728 --> 11:36.355
The heart--

11:37.864 --> 11:40.765
The future wife... wife... wife... Wife, is it?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.963
It's not something to be that thrilled
about now, after all this time...

11:44.003 --> 11:46.301
I'll be with Hotaru!

11:46.339 --> 11:48.068
Yeah... Be at her side.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.573
Yeah.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.584
I should go back...
before anything happens...

12:19.639 --> 12:23.439
W-What is this?
It's hailing out of season?

12:23.476 --> 12:25.341
It's coming down pretty hard...

12:28.948 --> 12:31.348
Oh, no, this is bad!

12:34.754 --> 12:36.278
Oh, no! We have a problem!

12:36.322 --> 12:37.914
Let's help!

12:37.957 --> 12:38.582
Yeah!

12:39.893 --> 12:42.123
Hotaru!

12:43.797 --> 12:45.128
Hotaru--!

12:57.844 --> 12:59.277
Dammit!

13:05.919 --> 13:07.284
Thanks!

13:07.987 --> 13:09.784
It's all right...

13:10.723 --> 13:13.317
I have to protect these
saplings, if nothing else...

13:13.359 --> 13:16.692
I was finally able to make a species
that was strong against illness.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.822
Strong against illness...?

13:18.865 --> 13:22.699
Improvements aren't just
about making it more beautiful!

13:33.379 --> 13:34.311
Are you all right?

13:34.347 --> 13:36.542
Hold yourself steady...!

13:37.650 --> 13:38.548
Who is it...!?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.715
Work is work.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.517
The path to the chief executive is
more important than romance!

13:43.556 --> 13:46.582
I'll take the old man's pure heart!

13:48.127 --> 13:50.925
Appear, Daimohn!

13:56.636 --> 14:00.367
Ubara! Bara bara!

14:01.507 --> 14:03.202
Petals with no luster...

14:03.243 --> 14:05.108
Too much fertilizer.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.347
S-Shut up!

14:10.383 --> 14:11.941
Hurry up and finish your job!

14:13.519 --> 14:14.543
W-What are you doing!?

14:14.587 --> 14:15.713
Hey, stop it!

14:22.896 --> 14:25.296
It's a Daimohn!

14:26.299 --> 14:28.460
MOON PRISM POWER...

14:28.501 --> 14:30.901
MAKE UP!

14:39.913 --> 14:43.041
Those who don't take good care of flowers!

14:43.082 --> 14:45.482
That's the type of people
who will ruin the Earth!

14:48.688 --> 14:52.522
For love and justice, an apprentice
to a pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

14:52.558 --> 14:54.856
Sailor Chibi Moon!

14:55.628 --> 14:57.687
In the name of the future moon...

14:57.730 --> 14:59.994
...I'll punish you!

15:00.333 --> 15:02.062
A pesky little girl!

15:02.101 --> 15:03.432
Ubara!

15:03.469 --> 15:06.836
Ubara! Bara bara!

15:13.146 --> 15:16.013
Attacking with a rose is a move
that I use as a last resort.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.609
I am troubled by copycats.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.517
D-Damn you!

15:22.555 --> 15:26.013
It's too early to be so angry.
The main event finally appears.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.089
Sorry to keep you waiting!

15:34.600 --> 15:36.067
For love and justice...

15:36.102 --> 15:38.093
...the pretty solder in a sailor suit!

15:42.709 --> 15:44.108
Sailor Moon!

15:45.712 --> 15:49.307
In the name of the moon, I'll punish you!

15:50.750 --> 15:53.310
Ubara, kill every last one of them!

16:02.595 --> 16:05.792
THE RED ROSE OF PASSION!

16:10.036 --> 16:12.266
PINK SUGAR...

16:12.305 --> 16:14.330
...HEART...

16:14.374 --> 16:16.638
...ATTACK!

16:24.017 --> 16:26.383
What are you doing,
losing to a little girl like that!?

16:28.154 --> 16:31.817
Beautiful roses are full of thorns!

16:35.228 --> 16:36.889
EMBRACE OF ROSES!

16:36.929 --> 16:39.864
Give them a good squeeze!

16:40.133 --> 16:41.361
Oh, no!

16:42.468 --> 16:44.095
Take this!

16:48.041 --> 16:49.668
Are you all right?

16:49.709 --> 16:50.801
What are you doing!?

16:50.843 --> 16:54.404
There's no way you would
lose to girls like them!

16:58.217 --> 16:59.411
Damn you...!

17:20.573 --> 17:24.065
Jealousy is the meaning
behind yellow roses!!

17:27.680 --> 17:29.045
W-What is this!?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.949
Oh... Tuxedo Mask!!

17:34.854 --> 17:36.583
T-This hurts!

17:52.605 --> 17:55.597
I did it! I finally did it!

18:04.584 --> 18:07.280
I'm withering!

18:11.891 --> 18:14.883
What's wrong, Ubara?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.125
Now, Sailor Moon!

18:21.134 --> 18:21.862
Yeah!

18:23.669 --> 18:25.762
CRISIS...

18:25.805 --> 18:28.205
MAKE UP!

18:57.403 --> 19:01.134
RAINBOW...

19:01.174 --> 19:02.607
...MOON...

19:02.642 --> 19:05.475
...HEART ACHE!

19:12.251 --> 19:15.277
I'm already withered!

19:18.491 --> 19:20.982
Bara bara!

19:33.639 --> 19:37.131
That's why I wasn't too
thrilled about doing this!

19:44.450 --> 19:48.181
What was that?
I felt a strong power for a moment...

19:48.221 --> 19:50.951
It's an eerie pulse of darkness...!

19:50.990 --> 19:54.289
Please be careful, Small Lady...

20:00.066 --> 20:02.398
Hotaru!

20:03.669 --> 20:04.931
I'm so glad!

20:04.971 --> 20:06.438
Chibiusa...?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.430
Papa! Are you all right?

20:08.474 --> 20:10.465
Oh, I'm fine! I'm fine!

20:10.509 --> 20:12.136
But... did I have a dream?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.636
It was a terrible storm!

20:15.615 --> 20:18.311
But let's come here again!

20:18.351 --> 20:20.410
Yes...

20:23.410 --> 20:27.410
