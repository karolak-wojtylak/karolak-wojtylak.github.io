WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:03.963
Chibiusa has a boyfriend?

00:04.001 --> 00:07.368
Because I'm her guardian,
I can't just sit and watch!

00:07.405 --> 00:11.307
I'll become the cupid of love,
and do some matchmaking!

00:11.342 --> 00:12.502
Become better friends!

00:12.543 --> 00:14.374
Become better friends!

00:14.412 --> 00:17.438
Hey, now, you over there that's getting
in the way of my spell of love!

00:17.482 --> 00:20.383
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

00:31.573 --> 00:33.632
Isn't there something?

00:33.675 --> 00:36.371
Sheesh, this house really has NOTHING!

00:36.411 --> 00:38.003
Oh, there IS something!

00:38.046 --> 00:41.174
Such a good thing, too!

00:41.650 --> 00:43.413
Let's see...

00:46.254 --> 00:48.449
Now, everyone eat up!

00:48.490 --> 00:51.118
W-Where did you get this apple pie...?

00:51.159 --> 00:53.719
Usagi, I hope YOU didn't make it...

00:54.062 --> 00:56.428
It was in the oven...

00:56.465 --> 00:59.593
I think Mom baked it
and left it here for us...

00:59.634 --> 01:02.865
Then we can eat it without fear.

01:03.138 --> 01:07.370
Well, we don't want to get food poisoning
right before our entrance exams.

01:08.143 --> 01:10.236
What's THAT supposed to mean!?

01:10.946 --> 01:13.107
Well, now... Here, here, and here.

01:14.783 --> 01:18.344
Wow, this apple pie sure
has a lot of apples in it!

01:19.921 --> 01:23.015
Minako... Your sense of humor
is going downhill lately.

01:23.058 --> 01:24.355
Yeah, yeah.

01:24.393 --> 01:27.021
Yup, she's right...

01:27.062 --> 01:30.122
Hey, guys, do you know what happened
to the apple pie that was in the ove--

01:33.902 --> 01:37.133
The apple pie that I
took the effort to make...

01:37.439 --> 01:38.929
T-This is...

01:38.974 --> 01:40.908
...something we shouldn't have eaten?

01:40.942 --> 01:43.502
H-How are you going to
take responsibility for this!?

01:43.545 --> 01:46.844
Sheesh, Usagi!
You really are hopeless!

01:47.282 --> 01:48.977
Don't worry...

01:50.652 --> 01:53.348
In the name of Mars...

01:53.388 --> 01:56.983
...I will chastise Usagi for you!

01:57.492 --> 01:58.356
Ouch!

01:59.027 --> 02:01.860
Y-Y-You traitor!

02:02.998 --> 02:06.331
I wanted Masanori to eat this, too!

02:06.368 --> 02:09.098
Who's Masanori?

02:10.705 --> 02:15.267
T-That doesn't matter, does it!?
Oh, I have to get going now...

02:16.178 --> 02:20.512
Usagi! I'll have you
make up for this later!!

02:21.850 --> 02:23.477
Where did Chibiusa go?

02:23.518 --> 02:27.420
I don't know, but lately,
she started going to art class...

02:27.456 --> 02:30.084
...saying that she's
going to study sculpting...

02:30.125 --> 02:31.558
I see...

02:31.593 --> 02:35.029
Then maybe she made
a good friend there?

02:35.063 --> 02:38.897
Considering that she baked
such a delicious apple pie...

02:38.934 --> 02:42.529
...perhaps she found someone that
she feels is more than just a friend?

02:42.671 --> 02:45.538
Come to think, she mentioned
someone named Masanori...

02:46.274 --> 02:50.040
But should we really
eat all of this...?

02:50.512 --> 02:53.379
It does no good to keep
it partially eaten.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.815
We'll leave the rest
for Usagi to deal with.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.349
Guess so.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.819
You're kidding...

03:16.638 --> 03:19.072
It's Masanori...

03:38.693 --> 03:39.591
She's here...!

03:40.662 --> 03:43.096
I wonder who he's waiting for?

03:48.970 --> 03:51.598
M-Miss Michiru!

03:51.973 --> 03:53.873
Oh, Masanori.

03:53.909 --> 03:55.706
Hello.

03:55.744 --> 03:57.075
U-Um...

03:57.112 --> 03:59.740
What's wrong?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.749
T-These are a token of my affection...

04:01.783 --> 04:03.512
Please accept them!

04:03.552 --> 04:05.486
My, they're beautiful roses...

04:05.520 --> 04:08.387
These flowers represent
passionate love.

04:10.258 --> 04:12.886
I-Impossible!

04:16.398 --> 04:18.161
I understand.

04:18.199 --> 04:20.633
Thank you...

04:24.172 --> 04:26.470
Oh, you were here too, Chibiusa?

04:28.910 --> 04:30.741
Masanori and Chibiusa...

04:30.779 --> 04:32.303
Let's hurry.

04:32.347 --> 04:34.076
The class will begin soon.

04:34.115 --> 04:36.242
S-Sure...

04:37.986 --> 04:41.478
I won't let this get me down!!

04:55.303 --> 04:56.201
Sheesh!

04:56.237 --> 05:00.105
Why do I have to watch
over how Chibiusa is doing!?

05:00.575 --> 05:04.671
It's your fault for bringing
the apple pie over to us!

05:04.713 --> 05:06.374
You have to take responsibility for it!

05:06.414 --> 05:07.108
Yeah, yeah...

05:11.486 --> 05:14.114
It's not going all that well...

05:14.155 --> 05:17.181
Hey, Tsukino, what's that?
An urn?

05:17.225 --> 05:19.284
No, it's a holy grail.

05:19.327 --> 05:22.592
I saw a picture of it in my
mom's room. Just once, though...

05:22.631 --> 05:24.622
It had a lot of gems on it.

05:24.666 --> 05:29.433
I've always thought that
I wanted one just like it...

05:29.471 --> 05:32.133
A holy grail, huh...?

05:32.440 --> 05:35.898
Then it probably would be
better to do this here.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.611
And about the gems...

05:38.647 --> 05:42.879
If you stick on buttons, beads, and such,
I think it'd look more like a holy grail.

05:43.184 --> 05:44.947
You're right.

05:44.986 --> 05:47.386
You're as amazing
as I imagined, Masanori.

05:47.422 --> 05:49.390
Nah, I'm not that great.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.428
So that's the much-rumored Masanori.

05:56.464 --> 05:59.399
What is that?
She's doing rather well there...

06:03.271 --> 06:06.900
You're so wonderful, Masanori...

06:06.941 --> 06:11.674
He really is the only one
who can be my friend after all.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.546
So Michiru comes to
this school as well...

06:21.990 --> 06:26.086
There seems to be a
painting class next door.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.357
Masanori...

06:28.596 --> 06:32.362
You shouldn't be helping Chibiusa
too much with her artwork...

06:33.334 --> 06:35.097
Oh, y-you're right...

06:35.770 --> 06:37.135
Do your best.

06:37.172 --> 06:40.369
My dear little rivals...

06:41.810 --> 06:44.244
What a wonderful person!

06:44.279 --> 06:47.737
Michiru...
I haven't lost to you yet!!

06:49.150 --> 06:52.984
I see... So that's what's going on...

06:53.555 --> 06:55.716
Hey, what are you planning to do?

06:55.757 --> 06:56.815
There's only one thing!

06:56.858 --> 07:01.795
I'm going to play matchmaker
between Chibiusa and Masanori!

07:14.542 --> 07:16.009
Eugeal...

07:16.044 --> 07:18.069
Yes, this is Chin-chin-tei.

07:18.113 --> 07:21.480
Four ramens, was it? Hold on
just a little bit more for that...

07:24.085 --> 07:25.484
I ask you to do your best.

07:34.596 --> 07:37.258
Yes. Eugeal here...

07:38.032 --> 07:39.260
Hello?

07:40.034 --> 07:41.763
Hello...?

07:43.338 --> 07:45.067
Eugeal...

07:45.106 --> 07:46.971
Is something the matter?

07:47.008 --> 07:49.499
There was quite a bit
of time lag there...

07:49.544 --> 07:51.011
Nothing...

07:51.045 --> 07:55.243
By the way, have you
found our next target?

07:55.917 --> 07:59.284
Yes... I will send the reference
materials over to you now.

08:03.258 --> 08:06.318
I see... It's a wonderful monument.

08:06.361 --> 08:10.297
It is rather unbelievabIe that a
10-year-old boy created this piece...

08:10.331 --> 08:14.233
Masanori Tsuzuki,
a prodigious artist of a boy.

08:14.269 --> 08:18.137
His refined intuition and his pure
heart which keeps creating...

08:18.173 --> 08:22.075
...more pieces, I believe,
must be holding onto a talisman...

08:22.577 --> 08:24.044
I see.

08:24.078 --> 08:29.072
This might finally become the first step
for us to get everything in our hands.

08:29.284 --> 08:34.916
I shall now create a Daimohn for you
that's best suited for this purpose...

08:53.374 --> 08:57.902
Chokokkar!

09:24.739 --> 09:26.400
I looked around this area.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.376
It seems like Eugeal's group isn't
wandering around that much...

09:31.713 --> 09:35.376
I see... then we can
relax this afternoon...

09:35.884 --> 09:37.875
Hey, where'd you get those flowers?

09:39.087 --> 09:40.281
Does it bother you?

09:40.321 --> 09:41.379
A little...

09:43.424 --> 09:46.052
Is it a gift from your
boyfriend after all?

09:46.694 --> 09:48.059
Of course...

09:48.696 --> 09:49.890
Oh...?

09:49.931 --> 09:54.800
I didn't know there was a guy clueless
enough to be your suitor, Michiru.

09:54.836 --> 09:58.067
It's rather unusual that
you would be jealous, Haruka...

09:59.874 --> 10:01.739
I'm not jealous at all...

10:01.776 --> 10:05.576
It's just that I can't allow you
to look at anyone else, Michiru...

10:06.114 --> 10:09.345
Haruka...
That's called jealousy.

10:10.952 --> 10:11.816
Chibiusa!

10:11.853 --> 10:13.081
W-What is it!?

10:14.656 --> 10:17.090
The cupid of love
makes its appearance!

10:17.125 --> 10:18.092
Come on now...

10:18.726 --> 10:20.557
What are you saying!?

10:21.262 --> 10:23.958
Tsukino... Is she your older sister?

10:24.332 --> 10:26.960
Yeah, something like that...

10:27.168 --> 10:29.693
Nice to meet you, Masanori...

10:29.737 --> 10:32.729
Please be good friends
with my little Chibiusa...

10:33.641 --> 10:34.608
S-Sure...

10:34.642 --> 10:37.042
Well, see you later!

10:37.078 --> 10:38.636
See, Chibiusa?

10:38.680 --> 10:41.740
I gave you an opening!
Go ask him out! Ask him out!!

10:42.884 --> 10:44.283
Just go home!!

10:44.319 --> 10:46.719
Do you want to be stomped on again!?

10:46.754 --> 10:48.619
How scary!

10:53.628 --> 10:56.756
Everyone, please calm down.
There's no reason to be alarmed.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.265
W-What in the world are you!?

11:08.609 --> 11:10.236
Captured!!

11:15.216 --> 11:16.308
It seems...

11:16.351 --> 11:18.785
...that this didn't end up
being a peaceful afternoon...

11:19.954 --> 11:21.581
Don't say it so sorrowfully...

11:21.622 --> 11:23.419
This is our important mission.

11:24.125 --> 11:26.559
URANUS PLANET POWER...

11:26.594 --> 11:28.892
MAKE UP!

11:41.342 --> 11:44.140
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

11:44.178 --> 11:46.578
MAKE UP!

12:05.633 --> 12:08.534
This time, I'm sure it's a talisman...

12:12.106 --> 12:13.733
You again!?

12:13.775 --> 12:15.504
Dammit, I won't let
you get in the way!

12:15.543 --> 12:18.341
Appear, Daimohn!

12:27.155 --> 12:31.114
Chokokkar!

12:32.060 --> 12:33.027
Now!

12:33.061 --> 12:34.289
You can't, Chibiusa...

12:34.328 --> 12:37.820
If you transform in a place like this,
they'll figure out your identity!

12:37.865 --> 12:39.594
It's fine if I don't transform, right!?

12:43.037 --> 12:44.527
H-How barbaric!

12:44.572 --> 12:49.305
I won't let anyone have
the heart of my dear Masanori!!

12:50.478 --> 12:51.376
T-Tsukino...

12:52.213 --> 12:53.612
You're a bad girl...

12:53.648 --> 12:56.139
Think about how much
troubIe you cause others!

12:56.184 --> 12:57.742
The same can be said for you!

12:57.785 --> 12:59.616
Sheesh...

13:00.354 --> 13:01.286
HEY!

13:01.322 --> 13:05.088
Give back the crystal
for Masanori's heart!

13:05.126 --> 13:06.821
Rest assured, little one...

13:06.861 --> 13:08.089
We'll return it to you soon.

13:08.129 --> 13:11.587
This one wasn't a talisman, either...

13:12.767 --> 13:14.029
I-I'm glad...

13:17.371 --> 13:20.101
All right, I'm backing up!

13:20.274 --> 13:22.868
I'll leave you to
do the rest, Chokokkar!

13:26.280 --> 13:28.475
Chokokkar!

13:31.385 --> 13:33.285
Fighting here is
a disadvantage to us...

13:33.321 --> 13:35.619
It seems that way...

13:38.793 --> 13:40.784
Wait CHO!

13:43.364 --> 13:44.353
Oh, man...

13:44.398 --> 13:47.299
Everyone left without
cleaning up this mess!

13:47.335 --> 13:49.565
Don't just stand there, transform!

13:49.604 --> 13:51.799
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

13:52.273 --> 13:53.797
You're fine now...

13:53.841 --> 13:57.140
Just stay here and lie still.

13:57.478 --> 14:00.311
I found her... My goddess...

14:00.815 --> 14:03.340
MOON PRISM POWER...

14:03.384 --> 14:05.875
MAKE UP!

14:11.926 --> 14:15.259
MOON COSMIC POWER...

14:15.296 --> 14:17.696
MAKE UP!

14:53.968 --> 14:54.832
Oh, boy.

14:54.869 --> 14:56.496
Such a powerless enemy...

15:06.214 --> 15:07.943
Work #001.

15:07.982 --> 15:09.540
"Beyond the Massacre"

15:09.584 --> 15:12.519
Go! Art is to charge forth!

15:14.388 --> 15:15.252
W-What!?

15:15.690 --> 15:16.850
Uranus!

15:17.491 --> 15:19.152
Work #002.

15:19.193 --> 15:21.957
"The Ambition of Silence"

15:23.598 --> 15:24.895
W-Wait a minute!

15:24.932 --> 15:27.366
Make it a piece that's
easier to understand!!

15:30.671 --> 15:32.866
This is avant-garde art!!

15:40.648 --> 15:44.744
Stomping upon the divine heart of
art with your magic hands of evil...

15:44.785 --> 15:48.846
...and on top of that,
putting my dear Masanori in danger!

15:48.889 --> 15:50.447
We can't forgive you!

15:50.491 --> 15:51.719
For love and justice...

15:51.759 --> 15:53.784
...the pretty soldier
in a sailor suit!

15:53.828 --> 15:55.625
Sailor Moon!

15:57.431 --> 16:00.889
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

16:00.935 --> 16:05.895
Same here... In the name of the moon
from the future, I'll punish you!

16:08.042 --> 16:09.907
DOUBLE SAILOR MOON KICK!

16:14.148 --> 16:15.809
H-Hey, get out of my way.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.546
I can't move like this...

16:18.586 --> 16:19.575
We're gonna be crushed!

16:34.702 --> 16:35.930
It's dissolving...

16:35.970 --> 16:37.938
I see... So that's how it is...

16:40.241 --> 16:41.139
Uranus!

16:41.175 --> 16:43.268
That piece's weakness is water!

16:43.311 --> 16:44.608
I-I get it!

16:51.852 --> 16:53.615
My artwork...

16:53.888 --> 16:56.288
Now, you should prepare yourself.

16:56.324 --> 16:58.849
Isn't YOUR weakness water as well...?

17:04.231 --> 17:06.756
DEEP...

17:06.801 --> 17:09.395
...SUBMERGE!

17:13.140 --> 17:14.402
Whew, we were saved.

17:14.442 --> 17:15.306
Really!

17:15.343 --> 17:17.470
How long are you going
to be on top of me!?

17:18.079 --> 17:21.981
I should have used clay that
doesn't dissolve in water! CHO!

17:22.350 --> 17:24.978
Now, both of you.
We're leaving you to finish it off.

17:25.686 --> 17:27.153
I know that!

17:27.188 --> 17:28.712
Leave it to us!

17:31.325 --> 17:33.657
PINK SUGAR...

17:33.694 --> 17:37.494
...HEART ATTACK!

17:44.705 --> 17:46.764
Hey, what are you doing!?

17:46.807 --> 17:49.241
T-There it goes!

17:49.844 --> 17:50.503
All right!

18:10.798 --> 18:14.529
MOON SPIRAL...

18:14.568 --> 18:17.833
...HEART...

18:17.872 --> 18:20.306
...ATTACK!

18:29.617 --> 18:31.949
Lovely!!

18:42.763 --> 18:44.560
We'll see both of you again...

18:44.598 --> 18:46.065
Excuse us.

18:47.902 --> 18:52.896
Those two are more reliable
than Sailor Moon after all...

18:52.940 --> 18:54.805
Do you think you're in a position
right now to say that?!

19:04.051 --> 19:05.882
Then, Tsukino...

19:05.920 --> 19:09.515
You can call me Chibiusa, Masanori...

19:09.557 --> 19:12.651
Well, um, I guess I'll see
you again in class, Chibiusa...

19:12.693 --> 19:14.490
Yeah...

19:14.528 --> 19:15.517
Oh, shoot...

19:15.563 --> 19:16.655
What?

19:16.697 --> 19:18.824
Can you take this?

19:18.866 --> 19:20.595
I just finished it...

19:20.968 --> 19:23.095
Masanori... T-This is...

19:23.337 --> 19:24.269
See ya later.

19:24.305 --> 19:27.103
Thank you, Masanori!!

19:27.141 --> 19:30.599
You're enjoying your youth!

19:30.811 --> 19:33.803
Chibiusa, you look so cool!

19:33.848 --> 19:35.611
Y-You guys were watching!?

19:35.649 --> 19:39.642
Chibiusa... You have to
thank me this one time.

19:39.687 --> 19:43.623
Because of me, you were able
to be friends with Masanori...

19:44.024 --> 19:45.252
You've got to be kidding.

19:45.292 --> 19:48.090
Usagi, you were just
mocking the entire thing!

19:48.128 --> 19:50.323
Yes, she did do just that...

19:50.364 --> 19:51.422
That wasn't necessary...

19:51.465 --> 19:52.693
But before that, guys...

19:52.733 --> 19:55.998
What are you going to do about
the apple pie that I had made!?

19:57.171 --> 19:58.866
You still remember!?

19:59.373 --> 20:01.204
Of course!!

20:01.242 --> 20:04.040
I-I'll bake you one next time...

20:04.078 --> 20:05.511
That's not enough for me
to forgive you guys!

20:05.546 --> 20:07.309
You do have a point...

20:07.348 --> 20:10.010
But that was all Usagi's fault...

20:10.050 --> 20:10.880
Yeah, I agree!

20:10.918 --> 20:12.112
You guys...!!

20:12.152 --> 20:16.054
Usagi, you really need
to repent for your crimes...

20:16.090 --> 20:18.320
You guys all are so cruel!

20:18.359 --> 20:20.520
Are you prepared to pay
the consequences, Usagi?

20:20.561 --> 20:24.019
Please forgive me, my lord!

20:25.032 --> 20:27.091
Hey, come down off of there!

20:27.134 --> 20:31.298
- Please forgive me, Chibiusa!
- Hey! Come on!

20:34.298 --> 20:38.298
