1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,895
There's a talisman
inside my heart?!

2
00:00:03,935 --> 00:00:06,529
On top of that, the enemy
found out who I really am!!!

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:09,438
Kaorinite took my brooch,
so I can't transform!

4
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:12,875
And Mamo-chan got imprisoned
in glass trying to protect me!

5
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:15,436
We're in huge trouble!
Tell me, everyone!

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,711
What in the world
should I do?!

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,263
Tuxedo Mask!!

8
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:38,108
That's enough!

9
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:41,868
The pretty soldiers in sailor
suits now make their entrance!

10
00:00:42,513 --> 00:00:44,674
So, you've shown up...

11
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:49,384
Usagi Tsukino and
the Sailor Soldiers!

12
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:53,450
If you want to save Tuxedo Mask,
come to Tokyo Tower!

13
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:56,153
That will be where
you all will die!

14
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:01,728
Mamo-chan!

15
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:03,393
Usagi!

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,765
That's...!

17
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:10,203
Neptune and Uranus...

18
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:13,574
I'm sure they were
after Usagi's pure heart!

19
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:15,602
Those guys are like hyenas...!

20
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:18,279
Usagi!

21
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:19,908
Wait!

22
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:21,884
I'm sure the enemy
is waiting for us...

23
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,352
...with a trap
ready to spring!

24
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:25,150
Now that you can't
transform, Usagi...

25
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,180
...we have to come
up with some plan!

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,521
But, but...

27
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:37,397
Because Mamo-chan
tried to save me...

28
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:42,405
I'm still going
to save Mamo-chan!

29
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:44,941
Usagi!

30
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,311
Haruka!

31
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,579
Hey, buns-head.

32
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,281
Going somewhere so late?

33
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:00,187
Please! Haruka, can you
give me a ride?!

34
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:03,090
Sure...

35
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,261
Usagi! Usagi!

36
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:10,164
Usagi, you're so...

37
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:13,001
She's not thinking at all...!

38
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:16,370
Do you think you can do
everything all by yourself?!

39
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:24,481
Usagi.

40
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:27,109
Have you made up
with your boyfriend?

41
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:31,045
Y-Yeah...

42
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:34,822
Buns-head...

43
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:41,224
Humans all live by
sacrificing someone in the end.

44
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:43,759
Don't you think so?

45
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:47,095
What do you mean by that?

46
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:49,265
For instance...

47
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:51,639
Let's say that someone
you know is in danger...

48
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:54,042
...because they were
covering your back.

49
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:58,211
At times like that,
the person in danger...

50
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:02,652
...won't think about himself
and wishes you to be safe.

51
00:03:03,454 --> 00:03:07,390
It could be your friend
or it could be your parent...

52
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:11,953
Everyone lives by
stepping upon someone else.

53
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:23,498
I know that we
will have victims!

54
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,031
Then why?!

55
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:27,169
It's our mission!

56
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:30,544
Nobody wants any victims.

57
00:03:30,882 --> 00:03:34,545
But if that's going to
save the entire world...

58
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:36,018
What would you do?

59
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:49,959
Don't you think so, Usagi?

60
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,635
But...

61
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:56,970
The people doing the stepping
might be fine with that...

62
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:59,272
...but what about the people
who are getting stepped on?!

63
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,276
Shouldn't you think about the
people who are being sacrificed?!

64
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:09,048
I can't ignore other people
suffering just to save myself!

65
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,384
It might be impossible
for me alone...

66
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:13,390
...but if we all joined forces...

67
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:16,951
...we'd be able to find a way
to avoid sacrificing anyone!

68
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:21,556
- I'm sure of it!
- Usagi... You're a kind girl.

69
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,272
Is this the place?

70
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:32,708
Yes. Thank you very much.

71
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:46,222
Are you all right
with this, Haruka?

72
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:49,887
That girl...is going to die.

73
00:04:51,796 --> 00:04:53,730
We can't help it!

74
00:04:53,764 --> 00:04:59,066
To get the Grail, to save
the world from silence...

75
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:02,071
...buns-head will have
to be our sacrifice!!

76
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:16,715
Welcome, Usagi Tsukino.

77
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:20,520
Now, get on the elevator.

78
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:23,083
I will show you a route
straight to heaven.

79
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:41,303
- No good!
- Looks like it won't even budge.

80
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,007
Guess we'll have
to break it open!

81
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:47,279
That's impossible! There's a
strong barrier on the front side!

82
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,414
- Let's use the stairs.
- That seems a better way.

83
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:52,149
All right, let's go!

84
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,781
Wait, Venus!

85
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:56,520
Whether or not this will
succeed depends on you!

86
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,035
Tuxedo Mask...!

87
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,764
Welcome...

88
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:12,765
But any closer and I'll
shatter this glass sculpture.

89
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:15,772
I don't care what
happens to me!

90
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:19,280
But don't lay a
finger on Tuxedo Mask!

91
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:21,841
All right... Senishenta!

92
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:22,910
Yes!

93
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:42,667
What?!

94
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:49,311
You...!

95
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,305
Well?

96
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:57,812
This is...! It's not.
This isn't a talisman!

97
00:06:58,989 --> 00:06:59,978
What?!

98
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:04,017
Despite the brilliance it emits,
it still isn't a talisman?!

99
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:05,426
That can't be....!

100
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:09,729
How brilliant it is seems to
be only a barometer of purity...

101
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,997
...and has nothing to do with
whether or not it's a talisman.

102
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:15,835
Looks like this was
another wasted trip.

103
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:28,384
Are you all right?

104
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,654
You guys saved me...?

105
00:07:33,357 --> 00:07:34,654
I'm glad...

106
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:37,485
Even if it wasn't a talisman...

107
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:40,691
...I'll have your life,
Usagi Tsukino--

108
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:42,221
Or, rather, Sailor Moon!

109
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:45,996
What...?!

110
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:49,397
That girl
isn't Sailor Moon!

111
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:54,038
You're...?!

112
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,176
Stalking after an
innocent girl's pure heart...

113
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:00,581
...and then mistaking
her for me on top of it!

114
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:01,252
Ten million insults
and a thousand needles!

115
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:02,879
Y-You're joking...
Ten million insults
and a thousand needles!

116
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:08,987
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

117
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:35,211
You're...

118
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:38,144
...Sailor Moon?!

119
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:42,453
Minako...

120
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:44,125
But...

121
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:47,053
You're different, somehow...

122
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:49,989
What! Do you have something
against my perfect dis--

123
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,329
She's the real one!

124
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:53,302
We guarantee that she is!

125
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:57,933
Then, who is this girl-SHENTA?!

126
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:00,004
I have no clue!

127
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:02,478
Maybe she's a fan of
mine or something?

128
00:09:02,513 --> 00:09:05,175
First of all,
such a clumsy crybaby...

129
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:07,308
...can't possibly
be a Sailor Soldier!

130
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:08,978
- Yeah!
- To be a Sailor Soldier...

131
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:10,418
T-Then, this is a fake?!

132
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:12,422
...you have to be smart,
attractive, and cool like me!

133
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:15,619
Venus, you seem awfully
sincere about all that.

134
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:18,085
What a farce.

135
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,687
If you'll excuse us...

136
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:23,462
I won't let you get
away like that!

137
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:29,562
I have to take care
of you thoroughly.

138
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:32,600
No need to stay too long.

139
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:34,577
- Let's go, Neptune.
- Right.

140
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:38,812
I won't let you escape.

141
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,985
Senishenta!

142
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,386
You take care of Sailor
Moon and her entourage!

143
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:48,050
Yes-SHENTA!

144
00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:58,765
You give me no choice.

145
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:01,236
If you really want
to settle things...

146
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:02,830
...we will accept
your challenge!

147
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:07,737
How long can you keep
up with your wisecracks?

148
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:19,249
SAILOR KICK!

149
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:25,188
My arm, my arm!!

150
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:31,692
"If the merchandise breaks,
we'll replace it with a new one."

151
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:35,634
Whew! I'm glad
I'm under warranty...

152
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:38,268
How can you be
so violent-SHENTA?!

153
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:42,141
You're the violent one!
Special Attack --

154
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:44,943
LOVE ME MOON CHAIN!!

155
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:48,782
There's no such attack!

156
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:50,776
Usagi!

157
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,785
Don't just sit there.
Transform!

158
00:10:56,527 --> 00:11:02,193
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

159
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:34,258
What?!

160
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:37,199
So you really were
Sailor Moon-SHENTA?!

161
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,195
That's right!

162
00:11:40,104 --> 00:11:42,231
The one, the only,
the most famous!

163
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:44,567
Fashionable, attractive, and cool!

164
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:46,576
The pretty soldier
in a sailor suit!

165
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,237
Sailor Moon!

166
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:53,446
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!!

167
00:11:53,617 --> 00:11:54,948
Dammit!

168
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:22,837
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

169
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:29,411
YOU LIAR!

170
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,584
LOVELY!

171
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:51,338
Tuxedo Mask!!

172
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:53,502
I'm so glad!!

173
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:56,411
Mamo-chan... I'm so glad...

174
00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:58,776
Usako...

175
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,781
Mamo-chan!

176
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:04,984
Senishenta...!
So, you were defeated!

177
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,051
WORLD SHAKING!

178
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,104
Uranus!

179
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:25,870
Don't let your
guard down, Neptune.

180
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:27,433
She's quite powerful!

181
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:31,205
Hurry over here, Sailor Soldiers!

182
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:36,216
Up above!

183
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:39,312
That's right! Everyone, we have
to help those two up there!

184
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:41,321
Why?!

185
00:13:41,391 --> 00:13:43,859
We should just
leave them be!

186
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:48,227
We can't! Besides,
they saved me before!!

187
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:50,289
They're not bad guys!

188
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:54,232
All right, that's it!
I guess we'll give it our best!

189
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:56,262
But before that, Venus...

190
00:13:57,474 --> 00:14:00,375
Please, get rid
of that disguise.

191
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:03,305
Why? Why? Is something
wrong with it?

192
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,606
I borrowed the transformation
pen from Luna and everything!

193
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,415
Dammit!

194
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:14,585
Hold it right there!

195
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:17,753
I won't allow you to
blow up the tower...

196
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:19,853
...that sends happy
fun TV programs...

197
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,694
...to living rooms all
over the country!

198
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:25,134
In the name of the viewers,
we punish you!

199
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:27,026
So, you're finally here...

200
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:31,068
So, now what'll you do?
Run away like usual?

201
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:36,445
Why do you think I called
you all the way out here?

202
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:40,177
That shoe!

203
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:41,343
Listen up.

204
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:44,379
This is something I
researched on my own...

205
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:46,446
Growth fluid for Daimohn.

206
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:48,347
If I combine
these two...

207
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:52,757
...I get the same power...

208
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:55,863
...as Senishenta!!

209
00:14:58,035 --> 00:14:59,559
Look out!

210
00:15:01,872 --> 00:15:04,102
Seven glass figurines
of the Sailor Soldiers...

211
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:06,668
I'm sure our professor
will be happy about this.

212
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:10,209
Uranus! You're wounded!

213
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:12,743
This is nothing!!

214
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:15,684
Leave this fight
to us and run!

215
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,186
What...?!

216
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,880
Now, now... What's wrong?

217
00:15:19,957 --> 00:15:22,687
Where's the fun if you
stand there and do nothing?!

218
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:28,760
Hurry! Run away!

219
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,596
Do as she says!

220
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:32,693
Since you couldn't
find the talisman...

221
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,601
...you have no reason
to stay here, right?

222
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,597
That's true...

223
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:41,070
Let's go, Neptune...

224
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:44,672
They're saying that they'll
sacrifice themselves for us.

225
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:47,081
We should take them
up on their offer.

226
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,619
I thought I said I won't
let you escape!

227
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:58,220
Now you have nowhere left
to run. Are you ready now?

228
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:00,320
We will never...

229
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:02,426
...give up!

230
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:09,361
BURNING MANDALA!

231
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:13,199
SUPREME THUNDER!

232
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:19,110
Impossible...!

233
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:23,753
She has a strong shield
around herself as well!

234
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:27,552
It's dangerous if we stay
in one place! Split up!

235
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:29,586
No! We shouldn't separate!!

236
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:32,619
Do you have a plan?!

237
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:34,688
The only way for us to
break through that shield...

238
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,790
...is to use the
Sailor Planet Attack!

239
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,735
Impossible! She'll get us
while we're powering up!!

240
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:42,970
You're finished!

241
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:48,272
Tuxedo Mask!!

242
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:51,678
Kaorinite!
I am your opponent!

243
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:53,113
Come on!

244
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,674
Mamo-chan....!!

245
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,454
MOON COSMIC POWER...!

246
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:08,626
MARS STAR POWER...!

247
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:10,223
MERCURY STAR POWER...!

248
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:13,459
JUPITER STAR POWER...!

249
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,494
VENUS STAR POWER...!

250
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:17,335
I've got you now!

251
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:22,072
NOW!

252
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:24,546
SAILOR PLANET...

253
00:17:27,984 --> 00:17:29,815
...ATTACK!!

254
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:32,248
What?!

255
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:43,123
D-Did we get her...?!

256
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:50,002
It looks like you just
used up all of your powers.

257
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:51,834
This can't be...!

258
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:57,675
The people doing the stepping
might be fine with that...

259
00:17:57,748 --> 00:18:00,979
...but what about the people
who are getting stepped on?!

260
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,282
If we all joined forces...

261
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:08,415
...we'd be able to find a way
to avoid sacrificing anyone!

262
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,986
DIE!

263
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:18,962
WORLD SHAKING!

264
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,073
What?!

265
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:33,616
This can't be...happening...!

266
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:36,347
PROFESSOR!!!

267
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,168
- We did it...
- Yeah...

268
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:56,163
Where's Uranus and Neptune?!

269
00:18:56,406 --> 00:19:00,809
Those two... Why, in the very,
very end did they save us?

270
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:08,775
Really... What kind
of a whim was that?

271
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:11,279
Don't make so
much fun of me.

272
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:15,648
For some reason,
I thought Sailor Moon...

273
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:18,058
...looked like buns-head.

274
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:28,070
Usako... I'm sorry
that your gift is gone.

275
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:30,202
No, it's all right...

276
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:33,674
I'm sorry I put you in
danger because of me.

277
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,080
And I always get a lot of love
from you anyway, Mamo-chan!!

278
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,143
Man, talk about setting up a
mood in someone else's house!

279
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:46,178
I tried so hard, too!

280
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:49,323
Really, this
bunch of girls...

281
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,350
They really don't
mesh together.

282
00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:54,488
Hey, are you listening?!
Come on, we aren't an inn!!

283
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:56,590
If you're going to be all
cuddly-snuggly, go home!

284
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:57,861
I'm hungry!

285
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:03,762
It's me.

286
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:09,137
I see. Kaorinite has been...

287
00:20:13,216 --> 00:20:18,017
Then I want you to
take over her task.

288
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:23,554
You are my only hope, Yujial.

289
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:30,554
