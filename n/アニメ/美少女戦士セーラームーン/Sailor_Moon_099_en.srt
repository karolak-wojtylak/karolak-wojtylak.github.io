1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,491
If there's love in
confessing your feelings...

2
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:07,057
...with all your heart to
that girl you've fallen for...

3
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:09,797
...there's also love in saying
nothing and watching over her...

4
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:12,772
...bearing it all
without a sweat.

5
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:15,565
A Daimohn is after
such a pure heart!

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,578
You're a little bug that's
getting in the way!

7
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:20,046
I'll punish you in the
name of the moon!

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,930
That ominous dream
I've been having lately...

9
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:59,098
What is it trying to foretell?

10
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:17,049
Yuichiro...

11
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,061
A young man
with many worries.

12
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,625
What are you looking
at so late at night?

13
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:28,734
I-It's not that!

14
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:30,797
I'm just worried
about Rei's health!

15
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,303
It seems that lately, she's doing
that all night, every night...

16
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,506
Still, Rei isn't one to
stop, even if we tell her to.

17
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:39,708
It should be okay
once in a while.

18
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,615
B-But...!

19
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:45,320
I don't know what Rei is
trying to see through...

20
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,982
...but there is only one truth.

21
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,549
We have to let her do it
until she's satisfied.

22
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:52,153
"I am my own Lord through
Heaven and Earth," that is.

23
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,755
That is, we have
no problem, right?

24
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,663
You say that, but...

25
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:06,099
Hello, Rei! You shouldn't
put too much spirit into it!

26
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:07,633
Have a cup noodle...

27
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:11,638
I won't lose!

28
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,573
Here you go!

29
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:15,778
HERE! CURRY, okay to
eat in 3 minutes!

30
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,754
Spaghetti with meat sauce,
easily prepared in the microwave!

31
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,917
Your favorites: omelet lunch
and tuna sandwiches!

32
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,825
Friends of all-nighters, roasted
rice-balls and natto rolls...

33
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:27,329
...for when you need a
quick stick! And the dessert:

34
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,025
Coconut gel and bananas!

35
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,995
Rei...

36
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:38,007
What in the world are you so
seriously trying to foretell?

37
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,439
Is there something
that I can do to help?

38
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:46,714
Rin, Byo, Toh...

39
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,650
Sha, Kai...

40
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:50,550
Jin, Retsu...

41
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,555
Zai, Zen.

42
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,769
Oh? Yuichiro?

43
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:09,271
Yes... U-Um, Rei?

44
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:12,104
Sorry, but if you want something,
can you talk to me later?

45
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,166
This is a very
important fortune...

46
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:16,474
Okay?

47
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,312
Sure...

48
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:20,314
Oh, then have this.

49
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,319
You can tie your hair back.
So it doesn't get charred.

50
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:24,547
Thanks.

51
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,990
It's no good, I can't
possibly stop her.

52
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:33,086
I'm so powerless.

53
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:41,766
GIoria...

54
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,366
This is the ultimate
creation born from chemistry.

55
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:48,002
It truly is a
LIVING art form.

56
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:51,104
That's right!
A living art form...

57
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,140
The best work I've spent
my heart and blood for!

58
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:56,243
But you, Kaorinite!

59
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:59,813
You always make a waste
of these Daimohn eggs!

60
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:02,017
Always, always, ALWAYS!!

61
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:05,121
Please don't worry.

62
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,290
My plans, based on
perfect calculations...

63
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,959
...and harmony, are also art.

64
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,197
Until now,
I've had interruptions...

65
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:15,329
...that were outside
of my calculations.

66
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,700
I will make sure to
get the talismans...

67
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:21,404
...that are necessary
to get the Holy Grail.

68
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:23,135
That's right...

69
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,308
The end of this world,
the arrival of the darkness...

70
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:29,079
...and the destruction
of everything!

71
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:32,145
The time limit is
fast approaching!

72
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:41,392
Go, Kaorinite.

73
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,021
As you wish.

74
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,935
All these all-nighters are
starting to get to me.

75
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:52,942
Maybe I should skip
the study group...

76
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:57,607
Rei must be very tired...

77
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:00,614
Rei must be very tired...

78
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,781
Yuichiro said as he silently watched
over the figure of Rei as she left.

79
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:07,016
To be continued...

80
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,752
Usagi...

81
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,225
You want to watch over
someone you love forever.

82
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,923
Yeah, I know.
I understand that feeling.

83
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:16,057
Hey, you, Handsome.
You make me jealous!

84
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,894
You're the best guy in Japan!

85
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:20,027
Well, it's not that big...

86
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,399
N-No, that's not it.

87
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:24,565
I'm just worried about Rei...

88
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:25,666
Worried?

89
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,075
Yes. Lately, she's
been saying how she can...

90
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:31,274
...concentrate more at night, and
so she's been cutting her sleep...

91
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:34,681
...and trying to foretell something.
Her health will suffer at this rate!

92
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:37,516
Oh, so, it really
must be THAT!

93
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,715
Not even doctors or the hot
springs of Kusatsu can help.

94
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,416
Y-You have an
idea what it is?

95
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:43,755
Of course, I'm a girl!

96
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:46,660
Something like
"I can't sleep at night!"...

97
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:49,827
Of course, she's worried
about love!

98
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:52,259
L-Love...?!

99
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:55,665
Who... Who in the world
is she worried about?

100
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,604
You are so dense!

101
00:05:57,641 --> 00:06:02,806
Rei's trying to see if she'll be
happy if she marries you, Yuichiro!

102
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,711
R-Rei...and I...

103
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,877
M-M-Marry...?!

104
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:10,712
Oh, my, you're blushing.

105
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:14,417
I'm jealous, I'm jealous! I want
to live with Mamo-chan, too!

106
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,448
Oh, no!
You're embarrassing me!

107
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:19,223
Oh, don't tell Rei
I told you this!

108
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:20,661
Bye!

109
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:24,265
Rei...and I...

110
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,763
This is adolescence!

111
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,238
What's with HIM?

112
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,041
So, this is the vehicle known
as the city train.

113
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,980
If I use this, I can
automatically check...

114
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:42,382
...all the people getting
on and getting off.

115
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,477
This is wonderfully useful.

116
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:45,816
Go.

117
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,599
Now, all we do is wait for someone
with a pure heart to appear...

118
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:16,647
That can't be!

119
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:19,346
Oh, no, Haruka!

120
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,449
I don't open my mouth
THAT wide to yawn!

121
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:26,084
See, you have those
circles under your eyes!

122
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:29,288
You're kidding!

123
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:31,961
The hand on her cheek...

124
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:33,264
Here.

125
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,097
I'll take you home.

126
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:36,833
If you walk around like that,
deprived of sleep...

127
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,999
...you'll cause an accident.

128
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,666
I'm so lucky!

129
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,441
R-Rei...

130
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,978
I-I lose...

131
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,218
Rei... With a guy like that...

132
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,883
My adolescence is...

133
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:54,856
OVER!!!!

134
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:01,597
- Ready?
- Oh, wait a minute.

135
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,325
What's that string?

136
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:06,835
You don't put on ribbons or such?

137
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,201
This is fine.

138
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:12,708
It's something like a charm...

139
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,236
That was insulting.

140
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,337
Despite what you may think,
I do ride safely.

141
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,041
Hold on tight!

142
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:21,180
Oh, it's fast!

143
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,953
Rei! Hey, wake up!

144
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:29,284
Are you all right?

145
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,054
You seem to be deprived
of sleep lately.

146
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,154
You shouldn't overexert yourself,
even with the exams coming up.

147
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:37,963
No way! If I could do that,
I wouldn't be having trouble.

148
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,068
I'll go wash my face a bit.

149
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,297
I'm jealous...

150
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:44,636
Life is short, so maidens
should fall in love!

151
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:45,868
Love?

152
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,468
Usagi, do you
know something?

153
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,672
Yeah. Call it a woman's hunch!

154
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:53,477
But that's
not reliable...

155
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:56,644
Your hunches for what will be
on the exam keep missing, too.

156
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:59,018
I keep saying exams
aren't about guessing.

157
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:02,691
You don't look
like you're lovesick.

158
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:07,295
Romantic worries can be hard,
but you'd look a bit more excited.

159
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,731
Rei, you're worried about
something else, right?

160
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,827
Maybe about our new enemy?

161
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,498
Hey, Rei, you don't have to
worry all by yourself.

162
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,005
Care to tell me about it?

163
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,907
Thanks, Mako-chan...

164
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,836
But I don't
know myself yet.

165
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,280
What the reason
for this unease is...

166
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,441
If I find out, then...

167
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,488
Then it will be time
for the Sailor Soldiers.

168
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,614
Oh, but... I hope
it doesn't come...

169
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,750
...on the day before the exam,
if they can help it.

170
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,494
Who is that guy...?
Who in the world is that?

171
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,929
Dammit!

172
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:03,445
This is a beautiful song...

173
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:05,785
That's...!

174
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:11,220
Michiru... Is what we are trying
to do something worthless?

175
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:14,594
Haruka... What's wrong?
This doesn't sound like you.

176
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:17,327
If it's too late
no matter what we do...

177
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,129
Why are we doing this?

178
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:22,703
We started this knowing that.

179
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:26,004
Haruka, the wheels of destiny
have already started turning.

180
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,272
A new awakening will
arrive again very soon.

181
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:31,644
The only thing we can do is
to collect the three talismans.

182
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,546
For that...

183
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:36,347
Even if it means
sacrificing everything...

184
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:40,083
I'm sorry. My will was
weakened by the moonlit night.

185
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:46,294
That guy's two-timing!

186
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,162
I won't forgive him!

187
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,959
Are you Yuichiro Kumada?

188
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,824
Whatever you want,
make it quick.

189
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,596
I'm busier than
I look, you know.

190
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,496
Shut up and fight me!

191
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,675
Do you have some
grudge against me?

192
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,508
Why don't you ask
your own heart!?

193
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:38,241
Here I go!

194
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:41,210
Oh, well...

195
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:44,986
Are you all right?

196
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,012
Not yet! This fight
still is far from over!

197
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,421
Come on...

198
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,721
Y-You're pretty good!

199
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,398
Yuichiro? And Haruka?

200
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,071
Hey, can you knock
it off already?

201
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,232
This is adolescence!

202
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:07,539
- Yuichiro!
- Rei!

203
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,741
Haruka!

204
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,815
Yuichiro, what's the meaning
of this?! Explain it!

205
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,252
Rei...

206
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:21,613
So, you're covering
for him after all.

207
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,287
No, don't say
anything anymore...

208
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,255
Haruka Tenoh...

209
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:32,291
You're a two-timer, but you're
probably a very masculine guy.

210
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,233
Hey...!

211
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,737
Stop all of this
that's hurting Rei, and...

212
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:38,138
And break up with that
other girlfriend!

213
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,869
That's all I want to say.

214
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:41,843
U-Um... Who are...?

215
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:45,213
Rei...
Please be happy with him.

216
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:49,815
Shouldn't you
go after him?

217
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,911
I don't know anyone like him.

218
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:54,616
He's such an idiot...

219
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:57,291
Looks like it's
finally calmed down.

220
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,022
Rei didn't come back.

221
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,053
I hope she didn't
get soaked somewhere.

222
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:03,622
Yuichiro didn't seem
to be around, either.

223
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,600
Maybe the two of them are
sharing an umbrella, and...

224
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,832
Maybe...

225
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,805
- Usagi!
- We have a problem!

226
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,535
Everyone, come over here!

227
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:16,075
This is a rather
sudden departure.

228
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:19,911
Please forgive me.

229
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,375
Well, I'm sure you'll have a
lot going on in your long life.

230
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:24,317
Fare you well.

231
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,413
I, Yuichiro Kumada, will never
forget your kindness.

232
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:29,484
Wait!

233
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:30,890
What happened?

234
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:32,292
Where are you going?

235
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,057
Please, don't ask.

236
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:43,830
I will depart on a journey tomorrow.

237
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:49,175
Alone with someone
that you don't know.

238
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:54,206
It was a trip that I was going
to take with you someday.

239
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,177
Idiot...

240
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,248
Yuichiro, you're an idiot.

241
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:07,856
We have to hurry after him!

242
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:08,864
It's all right now...

243
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,694
It's not, Rei!!

244
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,827
Yuichiro is really going away!

245
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,498
That blockhead who
jumps to conclusions...

246
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:18,233
...can go where he wants!

247
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:23,807
Rei! Yuichiro was
worried about you!

248
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:26,406
He really cares for you from
the bottom of his heart!

249
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,473
Then...!

250
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,743
Then, why...!?

251
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:34,520
Why didn't he believe in
me till the very end!?

252
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:36,024
Rei...

253
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,988
You just have to
tell Yuichiro that!

254
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,088
Usagi.

255
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:46,498
Don't mope about it!
Go and make up!

256
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:49,528
- Rei, I'll hold your bag.
- Do your best.

257
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,237
Thanks, everyone...

258
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:57,508
It looks like I won't be
able to tell you goodbye...

259
00:14:57,547 --> 00:15:03,247
...no matter how much time passes.

260
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:15,926
To me, you will always be
a bright part of my youth.

261
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:21,870
I'll board the Azusa No. 2
right at 8 o'clock...

262
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:31,939
...and I... I will depart from you.

263
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:49,121
TODEN!

264
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,325
All passengers, please hurry!

265
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,633
Monster!

266
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:58,839
We finally caught one!

267
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,639
Toden! Take the pure heart
that loves someone!

268
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:02,644
TODEN!

269
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,974
All right!

270
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:09,049
Yuichiro!

271
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,849
MARS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

272
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:36,070
Hold it right there!

273
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,515
To steal the pure
heart of that man!

274
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:45,479
For love and passion, the
pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

275
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,787
I, Sailor Mars,
will not allow it!

276
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:52,692
In the name of Mars,
I chastise you!

277
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,121
Yuichiro!

278
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,030
TODEN!

279
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,593
Standing passengers, please
hold on to the hand straps!

280
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:07,604
This isn't a talisman either.
Looks like another wasted trip.

281
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:16,375
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

282
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,519
The pure heart is safe.

283
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:21,921
You again...

284
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,757
The slogan of the city train is
"No accidents, no violations"!

285
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,419
If bad kids can't
follow that slogan, then...

286
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:32,660
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

287
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,063
Toden, I'm leaving
you with the rest!

288
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,799
New line creation!

289
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:39,397
W-What!? What's going on?

290
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,239
Please wait for
the next departure.

291
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:46,943
Front all clear! Sides all clear!

292
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,409
All right for departure!

293
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:58,193
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

294
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,722
SAFETY...FIRST!

295
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:03,630
Look out!

296
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,725
TODEN! New line creation!

297
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:10,901
The next stop is
the afterlife!

298
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,138
Your lives are mine!

299
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:15,809
EVIL SPIRIT, BEGONE!!!

300
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:18,945
E-Emergency Stop!?

301
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,207
Move! MOVE!!!

302
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:24,147
Now it's OUR turn!

303
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,916
The sin of trying to steal
Yuichiro's heart is a heavy one!

304
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,390
Prepare yourself!

305
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:36,189
BURNING MANDALA!

306
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:42,502
Carrying dangerous items into
the train is strictly forbidden!

307
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:49,440
- Sailor Moon!
- OK!

308
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:17,471
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

309
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:30,981
Lovely!

310
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:43,864
They're pretty good.

311
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:51,066
Ouch...

312
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,667
Don't force yourself!
You're hurt.

313
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:56,672
- W-What about that monster...?
- What are you saying?

314
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:59,306
Did you have some dream
after you slipped and fell?

315
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:03,844
T-This is...?

316
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:07,083
You should think more about it.
Next time, give me a ribbon!

317
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:07,885
O-Okay.

318
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:09,720
We're going home now.
Can you stand up?

319
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,748
B-But...

320
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:13,317
You have to apologize
to Haruka later!

321
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:15,956
You picked a fight against
a meek little girl!

322
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:17,726
A GIRL?!

323
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,462
Ouch...

324
