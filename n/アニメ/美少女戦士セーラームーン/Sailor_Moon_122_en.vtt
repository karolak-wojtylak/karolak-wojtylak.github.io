00:01.700 --> 00:06.069
The next national practice examination is
going to be held at Mugen Academy!?

00:06.105 --> 00:10.007
Come to think, anything called
an exam is dominated by Ami.

00:10.042 --> 00:11.566
I'm jealous...

00:11.610 --> 00:15.979
But if you use words like
"slip", "fall", and "fail"...

00:16.015 --> 00:20.384
...I, Sailor Moon, will punish
you in the name of the moon!

00:22.000 --> 00:23.627
Telulu's student handbook...

00:24.302 --> 00:25.769
Mugen Academy, huh?

00:29.874 --> 00:31.569
There is something there.

00:31.609 --> 00:32.735
Yes, I'm sure of it!

00:32.777 --> 00:34.540
Wow!

00:34.579 --> 00:36.604
Ami, you are amazing!
Just amazing!

00:37.415 --> 00:38.712
Ami, you got...

00:38.750 --> 00:42.516
...the highest rank in the national
practice exam, with a perfect score!?

00:42.553 --> 00:44.077
Again?

00:44.122 --> 00:47.922
No, I'm not the only one at the top...

00:47.959 --> 00:50.325
There was another girl with a perfect score.

00:50.361 --> 00:54.354
A girl named Yui Bidoh, who is
always at the top in Mugen Academy.

00:54.565 --> 00:56.624
Mugen Academy again...

00:56.668 --> 01:01.332
Hey, the next national practice examination
is held at Mugen Academy, right?

01:01.372 --> 01:03.340
In this case, why don't we
sneak into the exam site...

01:03.374 --> 01:05.604
...and really do a good investigation?

01:05.643 --> 01:08.339
But we don't have a registration ticket.

01:08.379 --> 01:09.346
That's not it.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.848
It's not that we're going to take the exam.

01:11.883 --> 01:14.010
All we need to do is to be at the site.

01:14.585 --> 01:16.917
So, we don't need a registration ticket.

01:16.954 --> 01:19.286
I'm sorry, guys.

01:19.324 --> 01:24.284
I had been planning to take
that exam at Mugen Academy.

01:24.629 --> 01:25.823
Oh, man!

01:25.863 --> 01:28.024
Nothing less from our studious Ami.

01:51.089 --> 01:53.455
There are so many people
here despite the snow...

01:53.491 --> 01:55.550
Everyone is very studious, aren't they?

01:55.927 --> 01:57.918
Unlike someone we know.

01:57.962 --> 02:00.487
Sheesh, don't say that!

02:05.837 --> 02:07.498
We have quite a few here.

02:07.805 --> 02:09.102
Yes.

02:09.140 --> 02:13.440
Mugen Academy is becoming more
popular with its high caliber education.

02:13.478 --> 02:15.002
Those that gathered here
are especially intelligent.

02:19.350 --> 02:21.716
There are some that
don't seem that way...

02:21.753 --> 02:25.245
...but the enthusiasm these young individuals
have towards the entrance exams is amazing.

02:25.823 --> 02:27.586
Professor!

02:28.159 --> 02:29.524
Oh, it's you, Byruit.

02:29.560 --> 02:33.587
It seems like your plan
is going along schedule...

02:33.865 --> 02:35.093
Yes.

02:35.133 --> 02:40.594
I, Byruit, will collect an immense
amount of pure hearts.

02:40.938 --> 02:46.308
Yes. This is also a good plan to
awaken the Messiah of Silence.

02:46.778 --> 02:50.009
Thank you for your kind words.

02:51.582 --> 02:56.986
How about you go collect a few pure hearts,
instead of hanging all over him?

03:05.863 --> 03:08.024
Oh, Mamo-chan.

03:08.065 --> 03:09.293
Where are you going?

03:09.333 --> 03:11.767
Somewhere!

03:32.290 --> 03:34.815
Hotaru...!

03:38.930 --> 03:41.398
Hotaru...

03:42.366 --> 03:45.096
Where are you!?

04:04.555 --> 04:08.321
It looks like we've made it in
safely among everyone else.

04:08.593 --> 04:10.857
All of them look like the bookworm type...

04:10.895 --> 04:13.830
I just can't get to like people like them!

04:14.065 --> 04:17.057
But I'm sure they all have
dreams about their future...

04:17.101 --> 04:19.331
...and are studying hard
to achieve them.

04:19.837 --> 04:23.432
Studying to achieve
their dreams of their futures?

04:23.474 --> 04:26.773
And then there's me...
I guess I'm a sloth...

04:26.811 --> 04:30.372
It's too late for you to repent now!

04:30.414 --> 04:34.350
Sheesh! Fine, I'm just
a clumsy slow USAGI!

04:41.092 --> 04:43.560
Are you Ami Mizuno?

04:44.295 --> 04:47.696
You always do well on
those national exams.

04:48.566 --> 04:51.034
I was thinking I wanted
to meet you someday.

04:51.068 --> 04:52.330
You are...?

04:52.737 --> 04:57.504
Yui Bidoh. I was listed next to you
at the previous national exam--

04:57.542 --> 05:00.067
Oh, she's the one that
got the perfect score!

05:00.111 --> 05:01.703
And you are?

05:01.746 --> 05:04.840
I don't have a name that's worth anything...

05:05.316 --> 05:10.219
If you are one of Miss Mizuno's friends,
you must be very studious.

05:10.254 --> 05:12.347
What are your best subjects?

05:12.857 --> 05:15.587
Naps and lunch...

05:18.429 --> 05:19.726
You're so witty!

05:20.197 --> 05:22.688
Oh, Miss Mizuno,
this is the perfect opportunity.

05:22.733 --> 05:25.099
I want to show you something
that might help with your studies.

05:25.136 --> 05:27.468
Do come this way!

05:27.705 --> 05:32.165
This is our valuable adolescence!
I can't just study all day!

05:32.209 --> 05:36.305
Usagi, don't stand there resolved,
we have to investigate inside the building!

05:36.347 --> 05:37.371
Then...

05:47.224 --> 05:51.251
The waves are making a commotion,
and the ocean has started to be stormy.

05:51.295 --> 05:52.887
Do you feel it, too, Michiru?

05:52.930 --> 05:55.626
Yes. An ominous feeling...

05:56.534 --> 06:01.494
There's an eerie energy of an
unknown kind all over this school.

06:01.539 --> 06:05.236
I've been thinking that for a while now.
I'll get to the bottom of it this time!

06:05.676 --> 06:08.372
Then, we head down to THAT
room in the basement again?

06:10.047 --> 06:13.244
I'll make sure to tear away
the veil of mystery from it.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.117
This is...?

06:19.690 --> 06:23.626
A greenhouse model of the universe.
I made it in the Science Club.

06:24.161 --> 06:25.526
It's pretty, isn't it?

06:25.563 --> 06:26.621
Yes...

06:27.231 --> 06:29.631
This is the Tau Nebula.

06:30.101 --> 06:32.126
Tau Nebula...?!

06:32.703 --> 06:35.729
Our school is broken into five classes...

06:35.773 --> 06:41.143
Philosophy, entertainment, science,
physical, and professional.

06:42.046 --> 06:45.846
Other than the instructors for
each class, superior students...

06:45.883 --> 06:49.649
...like me become lecturers and
teach the students of Mugen Academy.

06:50.421 --> 06:53.151
You, a student, teach a class?

06:53.357 --> 06:57.760
Yes. Anyone can become a lecturer,
given that they are intelligent enough.

06:57.795 --> 07:00.059
That's the good part of Mugen Academy.

07:00.097 --> 07:01.086
But...

07:01.132 --> 07:06.263
Even if you do well in academics,
it doesn't make you a great teacher.

07:06.771 --> 07:10.036
Because to be a teacher,
you have to be one who understands...

07:10.074 --> 07:13.407
...the feelings of students
with poor grades as well...

07:13.444 --> 07:15.776
Or it wouldn't work, I think...

07:15.813 --> 07:17.280
That's so idealistic.

07:17.314 --> 07:20.750
Logic is what is most important in science.

07:20.785 --> 07:23.049
You don't need to think about
other people's emotions.

07:23.354 --> 07:25.322
I don't think that way.

07:25.356 --> 07:29.053
I think that science especially
needs the warmth of human hearts...

07:29.093 --> 07:29.923
Oh, my!

07:29.960 --> 07:32.360
Miss Mizuno, you're at the top of
the country, yet that doesn't sound...

07:32.396 --> 07:35.160
...like something someone who
gets such good grades would say!

07:36.967 --> 07:38.298
The exam is about to begin.

07:38.335 --> 07:41.429
I'll see you again,
kindhearted Miss Mizuno.

07:52.817 --> 07:55.411
That student, Ami Mizuno...

07:55.553 --> 07:58.522
There's something suspicious about her.

07:58.556 --> 08:00.387
There is a need to investigate...

08:00.424 --> 08:04.087
Perhaps, she might be
one of the sailor soldiers.

08:04.361 --> 08:07.125
Yui Bidoh, in charge of the science class...

08:07.164 --> 08:10.691
Determination of the truth
about Ami Mizuno...

08:11.936 --> 08:14.700
Leave it to me!

08:15.072 --> 08:17.097
That's for me--!

08:19.210 --> 08:24.477
This plan to gather many pure
hearts at once is all MY plan.

08:24.915 --> 08:29.943
If Ami Mizuno turns out to be a sailor soldier
and gets in the way, I'll get rid of her.

08:30.121 --> 08:31.088
Byruit!

08:31.122 --> 08:32.646
You stay quiet!

08:33.557 --> 08:35.650
These nano-robots are efficient.

08:35.926 --> 08:40.727
They are computers that faithfully follow
Just the data that gets inputted into them.

08:40.765 --> 08:44.166
They move however I want
them to, at my command.

08:53.277 --> 08:56.178
If we let these take care of it,
success is guaranteed.

08:56.213 --> 08:59.944
Yeah, do as you wish,
however you want to do it!

08:59.984 --> 09:01.451
Right!

09:03.154 --> 09:06.385
Why did you come back from the dead?

09:06.423 --> 09:11.122
It isn't so that you can hang
all over the professor, right?

09:12.563 --> 09:15.191
What's wrong, Kaorinite?

09:15.232 --> 09:16.199
Oh, no, nothing...

09:21.939 --> 09:24.271
It looks like everyone is
getting engrossed in the exam.

09:25.943 --> 09:27.706
Now, nano-robots!

09:27.745 --> 09:32.045
Suck up all the excited,
pure hearts of the students!

09:40.090 --> 09:42.888
Right now, there isn't
anything suspicious going on.

09:42.927 --> 09:45.725
Everyone is taking the exam so seriously...

09:48.866 --> 09:50.891
Oh, this is...!?

09:50.935 --> 09:52.027
The pure hearts are...!!

09:54.505 --> 09:58.532
Sacrifice your pure hearts
for our Messiah of Silence!

10:00.110 --> 10:01.600
So this place really is--!

10:01.645 --> 10:03.545
The headquarters of the Death Busters!?

10:03.914 --> 10:05.074
What should we do?

10:05.749 --> 10:09.207
There has to be someone controlling
the computers somewhere around here.

10:09.253 --> 10:10.880
I guess defeating whoever
that is is our only way.

10:11.388 --> 10:12.855
Let's let everyone know.

10:12.890 --> 10:14.221
Yeah!

10:59.670 --> 11:01.137
An eerie feeling...

11:11.815 --> 11:14.010
The Messiah of Silence...

11:14.051 --> 11:16.781
The ultimate evil that should be obliterated...

11:17.688 --> 11:18.677
Wait!

11:20.724 --> 11:21.986
Ami?

11:22.026 --> 11:23.857
Don't hurt that girl!

11:23.894 --> 11:25.122
What!?

11:25.162 --> 11:28.325
This is the root of all evil who will seal
away the entire world into one of silence!

11:28.365 --> 11:30.230
I can't let her off the hook!

11:30.434 --> 11:33.369
No, Hotaru is a pitiful girl.

11:33.404 --> 11:36.237
She's a pitiful girl who just
got used by the Death Busters.

11:36.473 --> 11:39.237
You're being idealistic.
Don't show sympathy to the enemy!

11:39.276 --> 11:42.245
That will lead the entire
universe to destruction!

11:42.813 --> 11:44.872
This girl has committed no crime.

11:44.915 --> 11:45.779
Get out of the way!

11:45.816 --> 11:46.976
Don't get in our way!

11:47.384 --> 11:49.978
No, don't lay a finger on her!

11:50.888 --> 11:52.480
What are you doing?

11:52.990 --> 11:55.481
I thought this place was off limits.

11:55.859 --> 11:56.985
Michiru Kaioh.

11:57.027 --> 11:57.925
Ami Mizuno.

11:57.962 --> 11:59.327
Haruka Tenoh.

11:59.363 --> 12:01.160
You guys are suspicious...

12:01.398 --> 12:03.730
Show your real identities!

12:06.070 --> 12:07.799
Yui Bidoh is...!?

12:09.673 --> 12:10.935
MOSAIC BUSTER!

12:20.284 --> 12:22.980
Haruka! Michiru!

12:23.487 --> 12:24.613
Stop!!

12:24.788 --> 12:26.551
Don't worry about us!

12:27.024 --> 12:29.390
I can't leave you here like this!

12:31.462 --> 12:32.656
An idealist!

12:32.696 --> 12:37.429
Such idealism to sacrifice yourself to
save your friends leads to your death!

12:37.468 --> 12:38.867
Take this!

12:39.470 --> 12:41.461
MOSAIC BUSTER!

12:48.045 --> 12:50.240
MERCURY STAR POWER...

12:50.280 --> 12:52.612
MAKE UP!

13:06.730 --> 13:07.754
What!?

13:08.165 --> 13:11.464
Soldier of Knowledge,
guarded by Mercury, the planet of water!

13:11.502 --> 13:13.129
Sailor Mercury!

13:13.470 --> 13:15.495
Genius girl Ami Mizuno...

13:15.539 --> 13:18.440
So your true identity is
indeed a Sailor Soldier!!

13:18.475 --> 13:20.272
Don't abuse science!

13:20.577 --> 13:21.703
Shut up!

13:21.745 --> 13:23.269
Die with these two!

13:24.481 --> 13:26.779
MOSAIC BUSTER!

13:30.554 --> 13:32.522
SHI NE AQUA...

13:32.556 --> 13:33.784
...ILLUSION!

13:39.530 --> 13:41.088
It's useless!

13:48.839 --> 13:49.863
Does that hurt?

13:49.907 --> 13:55.140
Invisible nano-machines that came from the
program that I control are biting into...

13:55.179 --> 13:57.204
...your body and are
trying to break you up!

13:57.748 --> 14:03.015
The only thing left will be your
beautiful soul, your pure heart.

14:03.053 --> 14:06.887
It's wrong to use science for evil...

14:06.924 --> 14:08.721
You should be using them
for people's happiness...

14:09.159 --> 14:12.651
You will sacrifice that pure heart
for the Messiah of Silence!

14:13.897 --> 14:16.730
I can't let her give away her pure heart!

14:22.539 --> 14:23.733
Sailor Soldiers!

14:24.241 --> 14:27.233
I can't forgive you for sucking
up all the pure hearts of students...

14:27.277 --> 14:31.236
...who are enthusiastic in their
studies just for your own purpose!

14:32.182 --> 14:35.709
For love and justice,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

14:35.752 --> 14:37.242
Sailor Moon!

14:38.655 --> 14:42.523
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

14:43.660 --> 14:44.991
All 5 of you are here!

14:45.028 --> 14:46.120
Sailor Moon!

14:46.163 --> 14:48.256
If you move,
Mercury's life will be over!

14:49.533 --> 14:51.262
MOSAIC BUSTER!

14:55.506 --> 14:56.700
Guys!

14:59.042 --> 15:01.408
URANUS PLANET POWER...

15:01.445 --> 15:03.777
MAKE UP!

15:05.415 --> 15:08.077
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

15:08.118 --> 15:10.450
MAKE UP!

15:35.245 --> 15:36.075
What!?

15:39.049 --> 15:41.313
WORLD...

15:41.351 --> 15:43.581
...SHAKING!

15:51.461 --> 15:53.861
DEEP...

15:53.897 --> 15:55.421
...SUBMERGE!

16:07.277 --> 16:09.245
CRISIS...

16:09.279 --> 16:11.611
MAKE UP!

16:20.224 --> 16:21.748
Super Sailor Moon!

16:22.926 --> 16:25.759
The one doing all
the bad things is that ring!

16:45.682 --> 16:49.550
RAINBOW...

16:49.586 --> 16:50.883
...MOON...

16:50.921 --> 16:53.822
...HEARTACHE!

17:04.301 --> 17:06.360
My cute little nano-robots!!

17:06.403 --> 17:09.702
Get rid of Super Sailor Moon!

17:15.245 --> 17:16.940
W-What's going on!?

17:16.980 --> 17:19.813
Nano-robots, you are
attacking the wrong target!

17:19.850 --> 17:20.714
Idiots!

17:20.751 --> 17:22.912
Don't you realize that it's me!?

17:26.089 --> 17:27.852
Machines don't have hearts.

17:27.891 --> 17:29.984
Science doesn't need hearts.

17:30.027 --> 17:31.255
That's what you said.

18:01.058 --> 18:03.492
Byruit has failed...

18:03.527 --> 18:05.893
A foolish one...

18:06.530 --> 18:07.895
Such arrogance.

18:07.931 --> 18:10.729
It wasn't even worth my time
to directly do away with her...

18:10.767 --> 18:15.101
Sailor Soldiers,
I have confirmed your identities...

18:25.882 --> 18:28.009
Is this what she got
for believing only in...

18:28.051 --> 18:30.315
...the mechanical aspect of science,
and not learning to love?

18:31.288 --> 18:34.189
Poor girl...

18:43.233 --> 18:44.894
The Messiah of Silence is...!!

18:44.935 --> 18:45.799
Hotaru!

18:58.682 --> 19:00.775
Sailor Soldiers...

19:00.817 --> 19:04.014
The battle has just begun!!

19:08.458 --> 19:10.790
Hotaru!!

19:24.875 --> 19:26.934
Mamo-chan... Plu...

19:27.344 --> 19:28.641
You'll catch a cold.

19:28.678 --> 19:29.804
Yeah...

19:29.846 --> 19:31.746
How long are you going to stay here?

19:31.782 --> 19:33.579
I don't care if it's just for a moment.

19:33.617 --> 19:36.279
I want to see Hotaru.

19:36.319 --> 19:39.447
Hotaru will come back all right... right?

19:39.923 --> 19:41.652
Chibiusa...

19:41.691 --> 19:43.454
Small Lady...

19:56.473 --> 19:59.909
Ami Mizuno... if you didn't
stop us back there...

19:59.943 --> 20:02.207
...we could have defeated
the Messiah of Silence.

20:03.246 --> 20:07.410
Your idealism has let
the Messiah of Silence escape.

20:07.818 --> 20:11.345
But... that idealism is what saved us...

20:11.388 --> 20:13.447
So, at least for today...

20:13.490 --> 20:15.424
We have to thank you.

20:18.424 --> 20:22.424
