WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.734
Silence is approaching.

00:03.769 --> 00:06.704
Quietly, but surely...

00:06.738 --> 00:09.468
Is this world really going to disappear!?

00:09.508 --> 00:13.808
Hey, you over there who's cheering
"All right! There will be no more school!"

00:13.845 --> 00:16.040
It's not time to be so easygoing like that!

00:16.081 --> 00:20.313
I, Sailor Moon will punish you
in the name of the moon!

00:38.000 --> 00:39.900
Y-You're the Messiah?!

00:45.407 --> 00:48.433
Please! Save everyone!

01:06.695 --> 01:07.719
- And so...
- Yeah.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.061
This goes over here and does this.

01:10.099 --> 01:10.997
Understand?

01:11.033 --> 01:12.091
Nope.

01:13.969 --> 01:16.699
The ominous dream
gets stronger and stronger...

01:16.739 --> 01:20.835
But, what in the world
is that girl...!?

01:30.986 --> 01:32.886
- Is Usagi here?
- Chibiusa.

01:32.921 --> 01:34.013
This is unusual.

01:34.056 --> 01:37.184
Hey! I told you not
to come here to play!

01:37.226 --> 01:38.784
Come on, Usagi.

01:38.827 --> 01:42.854
I'm sorry to bother you right in the middle
of your preparation for entrance exams.

01:42.898 --> 01:45.628
But I have a favor to ask
of my dear sister Usagi...

01:46.568 --> 01:49.469
"Dear sister Usagi"...!?

01:49.705 --> 01:51.468
Actually, it's this.

01:52.041 --> 01:54.305
The opening of a brand new planetarium?

01:54.343 --> 01:57.039
Chibiusa, you want to
go to the planetarium?

01:57.079 --> 01:59.673
Yeah! It'll be a learning experience, too.

01:59.715 --> 02:04.982
I see... This week, it will be narrated
by that cute boy DJ, Thomas Harris...

02:05.387 --> 02:08.982
In any case, it's close to here,
so I thought I could invite Hotaru...

02:10.426 --> 02:11.358
I see.

02:11.393 --> 02:12.382
I get it...

02:12.428 --> 02:15.955
All right, let's all go tomorrow.

02:15.998 --> 02:17.056
Thanks!

02:18.901 --> 02:23.702
But why is Haruka's group
keeping an eye on Hotaru...?

02:30.713 --> 02:33.580
The enemy is still collecting pure hearts.

02:33.615 --> 02:38.712
Perhaps Hotaru has a special
pure heart or something...

02:38.954 --> 02:41.149
I see, that's possible.

02:41.190 --> 02:42.714
Hotaru is a kind girl, too...

02:48.997 --> 02:50.589
That's impossible...

02:51.033 --> 02:53.399
I can't wait for tomorrow!

02:53.435 --> 02:55.699
And can I count on you for
the admission fees, too?

02:55.738 --> 02:56.727
For the both of us?

03:00.709 --> 03:01.698
So she says...

03:01.744 --> 03:06.704
Usagi, the mother really has to
take care of things like that.

03:07.349 --> 03:08.714
"Mother?"

03:09.017 --> 03:11.952
A mother who takes
good care of her daughter...

03:11.987 --> 03:13.955
I can't possibly do that!

03:14.757 --> 03:18.386
- Mother...
- I haven't given birth to you yet!

03:18.427 --> 03:21.590
It's so noble of you to
start her education now...

03:21.630 --> 03:24.656
Well... I would like to take
care of a cute girl like her!

03:24.700 --> 03:26.998
I'll give her away, yeah,
you can have her!

03:27.035 --> 03:31.233
- Well, I'm no match against her real mom!
- You can have her if you want!

03:34.209 --> 03:37.474
Lately, that dream where
the world falls to ruin...

03:37.513 --> 03:40.448
It's getting stronger than ever before.

03:41.316 --> 03:44.410
We must find the Messiah
as soon as possible...

03:44.453 --> 03:49.982
If they awaken the user of the Grail
as the evil Messiah of Silence...

03:50.426 --> 03:51.893
Hotaru Tomoe...

03:51.927 --> 03:53.792
She possesses strange powers.

03:53.829 --> 03:56.593
We must determine what
she really is quickly!

03:56.632 --> 04:00.568
In any case, she's the only
daughter of Professor Tomoe...

04:00.602 --> 04:02.502
...whom we've been targeting as
a suspected Death Busters member!

04:02.938 --> 04:06.965
That girl who is standing in the
light of the grail in my dream...

04:07.009 --> 04:11.002
I think I'm slowly starting to see her figure.

04:11.747 --> 04:15.376
She is holding a long weapon
of some sort in her hands...

04:16.418 --> 04:18.545
T-That means...

04:18.587 --> 04:20.020
The scythe of silence...

04:20.322 --> 04:22.017
The Silence Glaive.

04:23.492 --> 04:24.618
A-Are you sure about that?

04:24.660 --> 04:26.025
I'm not really sure, but...

04:26.061 --> 04:27.323
It can't be!

04:27.362 --> 04:31.389
Could the Messiah of Silence
be that soldier of ruin...

04:31.433 --> 04:34.027
...the one guarded by
the planet of destruction...!?

04:34.770 --> 04:38.467
If that's the case, we may not be
able to do anything at all anymore.

04:38.507 --> 04:40.737
The world will shortly fall to ruins...

04:40.776 --> 04:41.834
No...

04:41.877 --> 04:45.711
Even if that soldier of ruin were
to be reincarnated into this era...

04:45.747 --> 04:49.046
...we still have a chance if we
strike before she awakens.

04:49.084 --> 04:52.110
This planet will not be destroyed!

04:52.154 --> 04:54.179
I will never give up!

04:54.223 --> 04:59.058
That's right. We shouldn't give up.
In order to protect this planet.

05:03.932 --> 05:05.991
It's almost time...

05:07.269 --> 05:09.066
Soon, I will awaken.

05:09.905 --> 05:15.571
That time will be when what you wish for...

05:16.044 --> 05:19.571
...silence... will cover this planet.

05:19.948 --> 05:26.080
We were not mistaken to choose
you as the Messiah of Silence.

05:28.524 --> 05:32.085
I am the only one who
can fulfill your wishes...

05:33.061 --> 05:35.894
If you wish for me to awaken sooner...

05:35.931 --> 05:40.732
...seek pure hearts that become
energy for my awakening.

05:46.408 --> 05:48.137
Be of use to me!

05:49.077 --> 05:51.978
Try to make me happier!

05:52.014 --> 05:52.639
Yes!

05:56.685 --> 06:00.143
Welcome to the Countdown50!
I'm Thomas Harris.

06:00.188 --> 06:02.554
And now, I'll go over
the top ten hits of the week.

06:02.591 --> 06:06.527
In tenth place is a song
that was #30 last week.

06:06.562 --> 06:09.258
- Thomas... I'll be there to see you soon!
- The artist's album is increasing in sales, too.

06:09.298 --> 06:11.459
- Wait for me!
- All right, let's start with this song.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.491
Let's get it on!

06:14.970 --> 06:17.530
Yes? Oh, Professor!

06:17.573 --> 06:19.905
Yes, it's perfect!

06:19.942 --> 06:22.968
Do you like the stars, Professor?

06:23.011 --> 06:24.672
Oh, I'm glad!

06:25.213 --> 06:28.671
Yes. This time, I'm sure to...
Leave it to me.

06:30.018 --> 06:33.886
I see... You're the only hope, Mimet...

06:35.924 --> 06:37.186
Stars, huh...?

06:38.226 --> 06:43.129
The stars know all...
was something someone said before...

06:43.599 --> 06:47.626
Wish upon a star... was something else...

06:58.380 --> 07:00.371
Wait, Tomomi!

07:01.550 --> 07:05.042
You know, let's work on
today's homework together!

07:13.595 --> 07:15.119
Hotaru!

07:15.464 --> 07:17.625
Chibiusa!

07:18.367 --> 07:20.801
You were... waiting for me?

07:20.836 --> 07:21.734
Yeah!

07:21.770 --> 07:22.532
You know...

07:22.571 --> 07:25.233
There's a new planetarium
that opened up nearby.

07:25.273 --> 07:26.638
I thought about going with you.

07:28.310 --> 07:29.368
That sounds fun...

07:29.411 --> 07:30.639
Then, let's go right now!

07:31.113 --> 07:32.273
Right now...?

07:32.314 --> 07:33.872
I'm on my way back home from school...

07:33.915 --> 07:36.383
I should ask Papa first
whether or not I can go.

07:36.652 --> 07:40.110
If you do that, the show
will begin! Come on...

07:40.155 --> 07:40.985
But...

07:41.023 --> 07:44.459
Girls of this day and age
shouldn't say things like that!

07:44.493 --> 07:45.858
Usagi!

07:45.894 --> 07:48.829
Hotaru, if you can't do something on
your way back home from school...

07:48.864 --> 07:50.923
...without asking your parents,
you won't grow up to be a good adult!

07:50.966 --> 07:51.796
Hey, now...

07:51.833 --> 07:55.496
Actually, straying on the way home isn't
a good thing, but we don't have time today...

07:55.537 --> 07:57.767
If we aren't bothering you, let's go.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.266
Bothering? Not at all...

08:01.710 --> 08:05.771
Please? I'll apologize to your dad with you.

08:06.448 --> 08:08.848
Chibiusa...

08:08.884 --> 08:11.079
All right... Shall we go, then?

08:11.119 --> 08:12.780
I'm so glad!

08:12.821 --> 08:14.789
If that's the case, let's hurry!

08:15.691 --> 08:19.957
And Andromeda, born from
arrogant and selfish parents...

08:19.995 --> 08:23.988
...had both arms and
both legs chained together...

08:24.032 --> 08:28.298
...and with her freedom gone she was
sacrificed to a monster in the sea.

08:28.537 --> 08:32.064
The pain continued until
Perseus came to rescue her.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.004
As you may well know...

08:34.042 --> 08:40.709
...there are many more sad tales
concerning the girls in the stars.

08:46.621 --> 08:48.851
So she is here.

08:48.890 --> 08:52.326
The target is probably the narrator.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.887
But even Usagi's group
is here with that girl.

08:56.198 --> 08:58.860
This might work out even better for us...

08:58.900 --> 09:03.394
This is our chance to see
what Hotaru Tomoe really is.

09:03.739 --> 09:08.073
The giant scorpion let loose by the goddess
of the earth is a summer constellation.

09:08.110 --> 09:12.137
- Orion shows himself only in...
- Thomas...

09:14.316 --> 09:16.978
You're almost mine.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.082
Setsuna?

09:59.961 --> 10:02.759
Why are you here, Setsuna...?

10:02.798 --> 10:04.857
Did an enemy appear?

10:04.900 --> 10:08.267
Or are you still keeping an eye on Hotaru?

10:08.737 --> 10:12.867
Please, tell us. What are you
guys planning to do, Setsuna?

10:12.908 --> 10:16.400
I'm sure we can help you, too.

10:16.878 --> 10:22.282
I believe that we can no longer
fight without telling you the truth.

10:23.418 --> 10:26.285
Uranus, Neptune, and I have an objective...

10:26.321 --> 10:28.551
...to prevent the arrival of
the approaching silence...

10:29.157 --> 10:32.649
Our enemy is an intruder from another
dimension in outer space, the Death Busters.

10:32.694 --> 10:34.821
Death Busters?

10:34.863 --> 10:37.559
What is that "silence?"

10:38.233 --> 10:40.565
It's the destruction of the world...

10:40.602 --> 10:42.797
I'm sure that Sailor Mars,
you have already...

10:42.838 --> 10:44.772
...seen it in the form
of a foretelling dream...?

10:46.474 --> 10:47.270
Is that true?

10:47.309 --> 10:48.276
- Rei!
- Rei!

10:49.044 --> 10:51.103
I wasn't sure about it...

10:51.146 --> 10:54.673
It's just that ever since those monsters
called Daimohns started to appear...

10:54.716 --> 10:59.050
I've been seeing horrible
dreams over and over.

11:00.222 --> 11:03.953
That's the silence we need to prevent...

11:03.992 --> 11:06.290
...the image of Earth's destruction.

11:06.328 --> 11:08.319
Earth's destruction?

11:10.031 --> 11:15.298
Please place your hearts inside the
light from the orb at the tip of this rod.

11:15.503 --> 11:20.998
You should be able to see the image
that Mars has been dreaming about.

11:34.823 --> 11:36.154
T-This...

11:38.193 --> 11:39.660
This can't be...

11:42.597 --> 11:44.360
This is...

11:45.500 --> 11:47.331
This is silence...?

11:52.173 --> 11:56.109
If the enemy,
the Messiah of Silence, awakens...

11:56.144 --> 11:59.341
...this will become reality.

12:00.515 --> 12:03.143
The Messiah of Silence...?

12:04.085 --> 12:08.579
She is the final soldier
that should not be awakened...

12:08.623 --> 12:15.028
The guide to death who appears at the time of
destruction, and returns everything to nothing.

12:20.669 --> 12:22.432
Messiah of Silence...

12:22.470 --> 12:23.732
What in the world...

12:24.072 --> 12:28.475
Soon, she will reveal to
us what she really is.

12:46.861 --> 12:48.192
Uchoten!

12:48.663 --> 12:50.062
In your place...

12:50.098 --> 12:52.931
A wish upon a star!

13:00.742 --> 13:03.677
A wish upon a star!

13:05.547 --> 13:07.742
Everyone! Get down!

13:13.922 --> 13:15.753
A m-monster!

13:17.459 --> 13:20.394
Well done, Uchoten.

13:22.097 --> 13:23.894
It really is much!

13:23.932 --> 13:25.263
Uchoten!

13:26.101 --> 13:31.129
I'll get rid of the crowd,
so you get Thomas' pure heart...

13:31.172 --> 13:32.503
Uchoten!

13:32.540 --> 13:33.598
But, before that...

13:33.641 --> 13:36.201
Thomas, can I have your autograph?

13:36.978 --> 13:38.445
How scary...

13:38.480 --> 13:41.108
Fine, then!

13:44.152 --> 13:46.382
CHARM...

13:46.421 --> 13:47.786
...BUSTER!

13:52.227 --> 13:54.218
Hotaru, are you all right?

13:54.262 --> 13:55.559
Y-Yes.

13:56.631 --> 13:58.792
Hotaru!

13:59.901 --> 14:01.334
I-It's all right.

14:01.369 --> 14:03.803
It's one of those seizures.
I'll be fine in a moment.

14:04.172 --> 14:06.003
We have to hurry to the hospital!

14:06.041 --> 14:07.565
Wait here!

14:07.609 --> 14:08.940
I'll transform, and...

14:08.977 --> 14:09.773
Wait.

14:09.811 --> 14:10.869
Uranus!

14:10.912 --> 14:12.743
See how she fares for a bit longer.

14:12.781 --> 14:14.510
But, Hotaru...

14:14.549 --> 14:15.846
Hold it right there!

14:16.284 --> 14:18.047
Stars that twinkle in the sky!

14:18.086 --> 14:20.384
Sharing your feelings
with the bright stars!

14:20.422 --> 14:22.754
A planetarium is a place full of dreams!

14:22.791 --> 14:25.021
Someone who wrecks
such a place of dreams...

14:25.060 --> 14:27.358
We, the Sailor Team...

14:28.363 --> 14:32.060
...will punish you in
the name of the moon!

14:32.333 --> 14:34.028
Well, no matter what you say...

14:34.069 --> 14:36.765
...there's no way those girls
will just sit quietly and watch.

14:36.805 --> 14:37.396
Yes.

14:37.439 --> 14:40.306
Sheesh! Why do you
always get in my way!?

14:40.341 --> 14:41.205
Uchoten!

14:41.242 --> 14:42.038
Yes?

14:42.077 --> 14:45.979
Save the pure heart for later.
First, get rid of those that get in our way!

14:46.014 --> 14:46.844
Yes!

14:46.881 --> 14:49.042
I'm trusting you to take care of the rest!

14:49.084 --> 14:50.278
Y-Yes!

14:50.318 --> 14:52.047
Then, everyone, with me...

14:53.521 --> 14:57.048
A wish upon a star!

15:00.028 --> 15:02.394
A wish upon a star!

15:06.468 --> 15:07.799
Uchoten!

15:07.836 --> 15:09.701
Look up at the night sky!

15:13.408 --> 15:14.705
Hang in there, Hotaru!

15:15.410 --> 15:17.275
We can't move around like this.

15:17.312 --> 15:18.677
We have to do something.

15:18.713 --> 15:20.578
Due to popular demand...

15:20.615 --> 15:21.604
A wish upon--

15:24.185 --> 15:25.618
A rose?!

15:26.254 --> 15:27.983
That's enough, Daimohn.

15:28.022 --> 15:31.617
I have sealed away the
evil star that tortures people.

15:32.227 --> 15:33.626
You can't wish anymore!

15:35.597 --> 15:37.724
Thanks for the cheers...

15:37.765 --> 15:39.494
Answering your requests...

15:39.534 --> 15:42.628
A wish upon a star!

15:44.839 --> 15:46.136
Everyone, get out of the way!

15:46.741 --> 15:48.436
It looks like it got worse than before.

15:48.476 --> 15:50.774
Duck, Venus!

15:50.812 --> 15:53.246
Hotaru! Duck!

16:03.791 --> 16:04.723
Just as we thought!

16:04.759 --> 16:05.726
Hotaru!

16:07.428 --> 16:08.554
What...!?

16:08.596 --> 16:09.494
Can it be...?

16:10.765 --> 16:11.993
Hotaru...

16:12.500 --> 16:13.990
I-Impossible...

16:14.802 --> 16:16.997
A Sailor Soldier...!?

16:19.908 --> 16:21.000
Y-You are...!

16:23.211 --> 16:24.872
W-What...!?

16:24.913 --> 16:27.507
M-My body...

16:28.383 --> 16:29.441
...doesn't move!

16:29.484 --> 16:31.008
Now, Sailor Moon!

16:33.188 --> 16:35.213
CRISIS...

16:35.256 --> 16:37.656
MAKE UP!

17:05.119 --> 17:08.782
RAINBOW...

17:08.823 --> 17:10.222
...MOON...

17:10.258 --> 17:13.091
...HEARTACHE!

17:26.441 --> 17:29.035
Love-Lovely!

17:44.392 --> 17:46.826
WORLD...

17:46.861 --> 17:48.886
...SHAKING!

17:54.135 --> 17:56.797
DEEP...

17:56.838 --> 17:58.066
...SUBMERGE!

18:00.642 --> 18:03.338
DEAD SCREAM...

18:06.914 --> 18:07.437
You can't!

18:15.423 --> 18:18.984
STOP!

18:19.594 --> 18:20.686
Chibiusa!!

18:28.670 --> 18:30.035
Sailor Moon!

18:30.071 --> 18:31.095
What are you doing!?

18:31.139 --> 18:32.265
Get out of the way.

18:32.307 --> 18:33.569
W-What!?

18:34.042 --> 18:37.637
She is the one guarded by Saturn,
the planet of destruction...

18:37.679 --> 18:39.874
...the solder of ruin, Sailor Saturn.

18:39.914 --> 18:42.178
When Sailor Saturn awakens...

18:42.216 --> 18:44.309
...the world is about to end.

18:46.621 --> 18:50.250
Get out of the way!
You don't know the horror of silence!

18:50.658 --> 18:53.354
Unless we kill that girl,
Saturn will awaken.

18:53.394 --> 18:56.261
If Saturn awakens,
it means the end of this planet!!

18:56.664 --> 18:59.690
You can't!
You can't just kill this girl!!

18:59.734 --> 19:01.998
Even if Saturn is the soldier of ruin...

19:02.036 --> 19:06.268
...nobody has the right to
kill Hotaru to seal her away!!

19:06.441 --> 19:10.775
You're too cruel trying to kill Hotaru!
There must be some otherway!

19:11.245 --> 19:14.578
I knew you guys would say that...

19:14.615 --> 19:15.513
But...

19:15.550 --> 19:18.075
There is no other way
to save this world.

19:18.119 --> 19:22.579
No matter what happens,
we can't let Sailor Saturn awaken.

19:22.623 --> 19:25.183
That is the destiny of the stars.

19:25.226 --> 19:26.784
Hotaru!

19:27.195 --> 19:29.686
Hotaru!

19:29.731 --> 19:31.289
Where did she...!?

19:31.666 --> 19:32.462
Oh, no!

19:44.011 --> 19:45.478
I was worried.

19:46.114 --> 19:49.481
A bad girl, not to come straight home...

19:50.084 --> 19:53.884
Yes, that is correct, Pharaoh Ninty.

19:56.557 --> 20:02.291
Yes, that girl is Sailor Saturn,
guarded by the planet of destruction.

20:02.764 --> 20:07.997
There can't be a better candidate
for the Messiah of Silence!

20:10.997 --> 20:14.997
