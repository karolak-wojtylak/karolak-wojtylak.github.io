00:02.182 --> 00:05.049
Haruka and Michiru are very beautiful.

00:05.085 --> 00:08.111
I'm sure that they met each
other in a very wonderful way.

00:08.155 --> 00:12.717
Especially since Haruka said that
Michiru was "more than a lover"...

00:12.759 --> 00:13.851
Maybe...

00:13.894 --> 00:15.555
No! No way!
Hey, now...

00:15.595 --> 00:17.688
You with the perverted
thought over there!

00:17.731 --> 00:20.564
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

00:20.600 --> 00:24.536
Back then, I wanted
to become the wind.

00:35.014 --> 00:37.608
I just wanted to be like the wind...

00:38.317 --> 00:40.979
Wrestling free from
the domination of gravity...

00:41.020 --> 00:43.488
...and plunging forth into
the vast reaches of the sky...

00:43.522 --> 00:47.185
That was the kind of
person I wanted to be...

01:02.575 --> 01:05.601
If I think about it, back then...

01:05.645 --> 01:09.081
I was merely fighting to
escape from my destiny.

01:10.383 --> 01:13.978
No matter when it was,
what I won from my battles...

01:14.020 --> 01:17.581
...were all new parts of myself.

01:23.496 --> 01:24.963
The wind is rustling about...

01:31.070 --> 01:34.870
Exercise in moderation is
a good stimulus for the brain.

01:34.907 --> 01:37.375
Oh, I think I might have an idea!

01:37.410 --> 01:39.469
I guess I'll go for the final touch.

01:40.346 --> 01:41.745
Here it comes, here it comes!

01:41.781 --> 01:43.476
The last spurt!

01:49.055 --> 01:50.989
Yes, Eugeal here.

01:51.891 --> 01:54.519
This next target, you know...

01:54.560 --> 01:58.496
How about we have a
track-and-field athlete?

01:58.964 --> 02:00.556
Okay...

02:00.599 --> 02:02.362
I have found one.

02:02.401 --> 02:03.993
Good.

02:04.603 --> 02:09.006
Then, I will prepare you a Daimohn
that is best suited for this purpose...

02:26.158 --> 02:30.595
Hurdler!

03:04.196 --> 03:06.426
I see, a huge gymnasium...

03:06.465 --> 03:10.094
If I get accepted here next year, maybe
I'll start playing volleyball again.

03:10.136 --> 03:12.832
You'll be all right...
I'm sure you'll be accepted.

03:12.872 --> 03:16.364
You guys have been working
really hard lately, Minako.

03:16.408 --> 03:18.968
I said that THEY have been.

03:19.011 --> 03:20.035
Rei...

03:20.079 --> 03:21.068
What?

03:21.113 --> 03:22.842
That nonchalant look...

03:22.882 --> 03:25.043
For some reason,
I was really hurt by that.

03:25.084 --> 03:25.948
Oh, really?

03:25.985 --> 03:29.512
I felt our friendship on the rocks,
and I'm not kidding when I say that.

03:29.555 --> 03:32.149
Oh? I wonder why?

03:32.358 --> 03:33.120
Come on, let's go.

03:33.159 --> 03:34.751
Yeah, you have it easy.

03:34.794 --> 03:38.252
TA Girls School has a high school,
and you automatically move up to it...

03:38.297 --> 03:40.629
...like an escalator! What a breeze!

03:40.666 --> 03:42.566
You'll be fine too, Usagi.

03:43.135 --> 03:44.193
Ami!

03:44.236 --> 03:47.569
No matter what school it is, you can
get in if you pass the entrance exams.

03:50.709 --> 03:55.078
That really doesn't make
her feel better, Ami...

03:58.918 --> 04:00.408
Rei, you are such a meanie!

04:00.452 --> 04:02.386
I just stated the truth.

04:02.421 --> 04:04.548
- You know... Rei, you can...
- What!?

04:04.590 --> 04:06.854
Hey... Over there...

04:06.892 --> 04:08.018
It's Elsa Gray.

04:08.060 --> 04:08.788
Who is that?

04:08.828 --> 04:11.626
That's Elsa Gray. You don't know her?

04:11.664 --> 04:14.565
She's a sprinter and hurdler that competes
at the national championship level.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.228
She's a celebrity at this school.

04:30.549 --> 04:33.017
I see... You're visiting our campus...

04:33.052 --> 04:34.679
So you're going to come here next year?

04:34.720 --> 04:37.951
Well, we're not sure yet.

04:39.592 --> 04:41.184
M-Miss Elsa?

04:45.464 --> 04:47.864
You have nice, firm glutes.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.697
Both of you are fit for running track.

04:49.969 --> 04:52.597
If you decide to come here,
join our team.

04:53.439 --> 04:55.964
You're a strange person, Elsa.

04:56.375 --> 04:59.105
You can join as their manager, too.

04:59.144 --> 05:00.975
I know that I'm not athletic at all!

05:01.013 --> 05:02.537
But I wouldn't expect anything less.

05:02.581 --> 05:05.209
Even though the team has the day off,
you're practicing by yourself...

05:06.418 --> 05:10.377
I used to be confident
about my running.

05:10.422 --> 05:13.585
But there was one person
who I just couldn't beat...

05:17.396 --> 05:21.230
She always passed by me,
just like the wind.

05:22.101 --> 05:28.336
I heard she already quit running track,
but I was never able to win against her.

05:29.308 --> 05:33.244
Even now, I'm still
running in her shadow...

05:33.946 --> 05:36.972
She's kinda cool...

05:39.418 --> 05:41.249
- See ya.
- Thank you very much.

05:47.192 --> 05:48.750
Target confirmed.

05:53.966 --> 05:56.366
So I have to work
hard and study more...

05:58.637 --> 06:00.867
That's right, Usagi.

06:01.106 --> 06:04.837
You're not stupid, Usagi.
It's all about concentration.

06:04.877 --> 06:06.606
Let's do our best, Usagi.

06:06.645 --> 06:07.703
Where there's a will, there's a way!

06:07.746 --> 06:10.476
Guys... Yeah.

06:13.485 --> 06:15.749
Captured!

06:18.057 --> 06:20.048
Something I could expect
from a track athlete.

06:20.626 --> 06:23.060
You sure can run away quickly...

06:24.363 --> 06:25.921
Hold it right there!

06:28.334 --> 06:32.794
I won't allow bad girls to harass
someone's wholesome high-school life!

06:34.606 --> 06:36.597
For love and justice...

06:36.642 --> 06:38.507
The sailor team!

06:38.544 --> 06:40.444
In the name of the moon...

06:40.479 --> 06:41.673
...we'll punish you!

06:42.014 --> 06:43.914
You guys again.

06:43.949 --> 06:46.747
Appear, Daimohn!

06:54.927 --> 06:56.121
Hurdler!

06:59.765 --> 07:02.165
Hurdler, eliminate those
who get in our way.

07:02.201 --> 07:02.860
Yes!

07:03.135 --> 07:05.603
Leave this to me, guys!

07:08.207 --> 07:12.041
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

07:12.878 --> 07:14.675
HURDLING!

07:14.847 --> 07:15.779
What!?

07:15.814 --> 07:18.305
HARD LINE!

07:19.852 --> 07:22.787
Let's draw lines so
they're all straight!

07:29.895 --> 07:31.226
This is Haruka.

07:31.263 --> 07:33.288
I'm at Shirakaba High School
in the S district.

07:33.332 --> 07:34.458
Okay...

07:34.500 --> 07:35.694
The one under attack...

07:35.734 --> 07:37.361
...is Elsa Gray.

07:37.403 --> 07:39.428
I see...

07:39.471 --> 07:40.028
Yeah.

07:40.439 --> 07:41.406
Help!

07:41.440 --> 07:43.670
I won't let you escape!

07:43.876 --> 07:44.865
Miss Elsa!

07:48.647 --> 07:51.377
Michiru and I knew Elsa Gray.

07:52.418 --> 07:56.184
Elsa was the one who
introduced me to Michiru.

07:56.221 --> 08:00.715
That was before I had
awakened as Sailor Uranus.

08:01.427 --> 08:05.454
The illusion of destruction
had cast a shadow upon my heart.

08:05.497 --> 08:07.988
The silence is approaching.

08:09.268 --> 08:11.759
We must find the Messiah quickly.

08:11.804 --> 08:13.328
The ones who can do that...

08:13.372 --> 08:16.307
...are you, and I.

08:22.114 --> 08:23.274
That again...

08:23.315 --> 08:25.749
I hear you're very fast.

08:25.784 --> 08:27.149
But I won't lose.

08:27.186 --> 08:29.984
On your marks...

08:30.122 --> 08:32.522
Ready!

08:35.160 --> 08:39.654
Back then, I was just fighting
to escape from my own destiny.

08:39.698 --> 08:44.067
No matter what sport I played,
there wasn't anyone who could beat me.

08:44.103 --> 08:46.230
Track-and-field was
the same as the others...

08:46.271 --> 08:49.138
I was just running to keep
myself from being bored...

08:49.174 --> 08:54.635
In the end, the only thing that
kept my interest was motor sports...

08:54.680 --> 08:59.140
Back then, the circuit
was everything to me.

08:59.184 --> 09:03.018
If I had not met
Michiru Kaioh back then...

09:03.055 --> 09:04.647
Miss Haruka Tenoh!

09:04.957 --> 09:08.723
I had heard rumors about you.
You really ARE amazing.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.660
I have someone I want
to introduce to you.

09:11.296 --> 09:13.161
Come on over, Michiru.

09:14.333 --> 09:15.766
This is Michiru Kaioh.

09:15.801 --> 09:18.964
She's really intelligent AND she's
said to be a prodigious painter.

09:19.004 --> 09:21.131
She says she's interested in you.

09:21.673 --> 09:24.005
You aren't sweating at all...

09:24.042 --> 09:26.476
Perhaps you were holding
back quite a bit?

09:26.512 --> 09:28.275
What do you mean...?

09:28.313 --> 09:31.305
Can't you hear the
sound of wind rustling?

09:32.151 --> 09:35.245
That was when I realized...

09:35.287 --> 09:37.687
...that she was THE person.

09:37.723 --> 09:41.557
And that she knew
exactly who I was, too.

09:41.894 --> 09:45.159
I was born with
the destiny of a soldier.

09:45.197 --> 09:48.564
But, in my heart, I didn't
want to acknowledge that fact yet...

09:48.600 --> 09:50.500
...because I had a hunch
that if I did...

09:50.536 --> 09:53.334
...I was pretty sure that
everything around me would change.

09:53.772 --> 09:55.000
You're weird.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.531
So, what do you want with me?

09:57.576 --> 10:00.170
Will you be a model
for one of my drawings?

10:00.212 --> 10:01.577
I'll pass.

10:01.613 --> 10:05.140
I don't like stuff like that...

10:49.294 --> 10:50.852
That girl is Michiru Kaioh.

10:50.896 --> 10:52.761
She sure doesn't look
like a junior high student.

10:52.798 --> 10:54.356
She must be quite popular
at school, don't you think?

10:54.399 --> 10:56.663
I heard that she
doesn't make many friends.

10:56.702 --> 10:59.193
I wonder why.
She looks like a wonderful girl...

10:59.238 --> 11:01.604
Yeah... I heard that
she doesn't like people...

11:21.793 --> 11:24.125
Did you find it to your liking?

11:24.162 --> 11:26.562
Thank you for coming here tonight.

11:26.598 --> 11:29.396
Miss Haruka Tenoh,
the prodigious racer.

11:29.434 --> 11:32.767
You seem to know
quite a bit about me...

11:32.804 --> 11:34.704
This piece...
Did you paint it...?

11:34.740 --> 11:36.640
You're rather famous.

11:36.975 --> 11:41.309
There are a lot of freakish fans
of yours at my school as well...

11:41.346 --> 11:44.247
One of them is a girl,
but she says she still wants...

11:44.283 --> 11:47.150
...to go cruising along
the beach in your car.

11:48.887 --> 11:51.117
The end of the world, huh?

11:51.156 --> 11:53.852
I'm surprised that
a well-to-do girl who...

11:53.892 --> 11:57.623
...can't even kill one bug can
draw such a tragic fantasy.

11:57.663 --> 11:59.290
It's not a fantasy!

11:59.331 --> 12:01.663
I can see THAT scene clearly!

12:02.601 --> 12:04.626
Just like you can...

12:11.376 --> 12:13.003
This is stupid.

12:13.045 --> 12:15.912
I'm Haruka Tenoh,
the first Junior racer in Japan.

12:16.315 --> 12:20.615
Memories of my previous life or the end
of the world have nothing to do with me.

12:20.652 --> 12:24.281
If someone has to do it,
then YOU can do it.

12:24.323 --> 12:27.690
I would like you to stop
investigating me like that, though.

12:29.161 --> 12:32.187
Don't say such selfish
things like that...!

12:32.631 --> 12:34.496
I don't want to do it, either...

12:34.533 --> 12:38.367
I also have a dream --
to become a violinist...

12:38.403 --> 12:42.430
I can't do something stupid like
saving the world from destruction.

12:56.822 --> 12:58.119
Is someone there?

12:58.156 --> 12:59.714
Help me...

12:59.991 --> 13:01.720
What's wrong?
Are you all right?

13:02.361 --> 13:04.625
Help me...

13:05.530 --> 13:06.827
What!?

13:15.040 --> 13:16.302
You... MONSTER!

13:16.908 --> 13:18.808
Help me...

13:49.174 --> 13:51.165
Don't do it!

13:54.479 --> 13:56.106
Don't grab that.

13:56.481 --> 13:57.971
Once you grab a hold of it...

13:58.016 --> 14:02.350
...you will never again
return to mundane life.

14:22.641 --> 14:23.608
You can't!

14:23.642 --> 14:25.735
He was human until
just a few minutes ago!

14:25.777 --> 14:28.507
Are you all right doing this!?
This is murder!!

14:29.114 --> 14:31.241
The silence is approaching...

14:31.283 --> 14:34.548
If I don't do this, there
will be even more victims!

14:34.853 --> 14:36.821
Are you saying that's why you
don't care how you accomplish it!?

14:36.855 --> 14:37.879
That's right!

14:37.923 --> 14:39.788
I don't care what means I use!

14:39.825 --> 14:41.793
Are you really satisfied--

14:42.994 --> 14:44.188
Look out!

14:54.372 --> 14:56.738
DEEP SUBMERGE!

15:12.524 --> 15:14.219
Where's the monster...?

15:14.259 --> 15:16.352
He turned back into a human.

15:16.394 --> 15:18.089
He's all right.

15:18.129 --> 15:20.256
I might have killed him.

15:20.298 --> 15:23.358
No... Next time, I'm sure I'll kill.

15:24.302 --> 15:29.535
It's not that I'm fine with it.
But I am a soldier...

15:29.574 --> 15:32.236
Because I chose to do this.

15:32.277 --> 15:36.179
Then why did you
cover for me just now...?

15:36.214 --> 15:40.116
If you hurt your hand, you won't
be able to become a violinist.

15:40.151 --> 15:41.413
I...

15:41.453 --> 15:46.447
I didn't investigate you because
you were the other soldier.

15:46.591 --> 15:49.389
It goes back much further than
when I realized you were the one.

15:50.128 --> 15:54.963
I was watching you in your
first race from close by.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.401
I wanted to cruise along the
beach in your car... just once...

15:59.170 --> 16:01.695
You don't rely on anyone at all.

16:01.740 --> 16:04.800
And you are always
honest to your feelings.

16:04.843 --> 16:06.606
I'm not honest at all...

16:06.645 --> 16:08.135
I keep running away.

16:08.179 --> 16:11.580
I know about you more than you do...

16:11.616 --> 16:13.880
Because I've always been watching you.

16:13.919 --> 16:19.357
You are the one person I don't want to
see walking the same path that I did...

16:19.391 --> 16:25.057
But... when I realized that you
were the one... I was happy...

16:25.897 --> 16:27.421
I'm sorry...

16:27.465 --> 16:30.525
I didn't mean to tell you all this...

16:30.569 --> 16:33.163
I'm sorry...

16:39.711 --> 16:42.509
And so... I...

16:45.250 --> 16:47.013
Looks like it's time for work.

16:47.352 --> 16:48.910
Yeah...

16:48.954 --> 16:50.922
Let's go, Michiru!

16:50.956 --> 16:52.617
All right, Haruka!

16:53.058 --> 16:55.822
URANUS PLANET POWER...

16:55.860 --> 16:58.260
MAKE UP!

17:10.609 --> 17:13.442
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

17:13.478 --> 17:15.878
MAKE UP!

17:31.863 --> 17:34.093
WORLD...

17:34.132 --> 17:36.498
...SHAKING!

17:38.970 --> 17:39.959
What!?

17:40.005 --> 17:40.994
No!

17:50.982 --> 17:53.177
Coming out all in a mess... Sheesh!

17:53.218 --> 17:55.709
Hurdler, I'm leaving
the rest of it to you!

17:55.754 --> 17:58.518
Leave it to me!
HARD LINE!

18:02.727 --> 18:05.025
I don't fall for the same
trick THAT many times!

18:05.063 --> 18:09.966
BURNING...

18:10.001 --> 18:12.697
...MANDALA!

18:13.171 --> 18:14.229
DASH!

18:15.540 --> 18:18.304
I'm sorry, but you
can't run away from me.

18:18.343 --> 18:19.935
Because I am the wind.

18:22.213 --> 18:23.441
Now, Neptune!

18:27.218 --> 18:29.743
DEEP...

18:29.788 --> 18:32.313
...SUBMERGE!

18:33.858 --> 18:34.756
You can't!

18:34.793 --> 18:35.555
Look out!

18:41.566 --> 18:42.396
Now!

19:02.721 --> 19:06.623
MOON SPIRAL...

19:06.658 --> 19:09.627
...HEART...

19:09.661 --> 19:12.095
...ATTACK!

19:21.372 --> 19:25.103
LOVELY!

19:36.755 --> 19:37.687
How is it?

19:37.722 --> 19:39.986
Looks like this isn't it.

19:53.371 --> 19:56.807
It's a little frustrating...
But the two of them sure do it well.

19:58.343 --> 20:01.744
So, I chose this path.

20:01.780 --> 20:06.911
No, I just acknowledged the
fact that I am a sailor soldier...

20:09.120 --> 20:13.819
Yes. I must find the Messiah
that will save the world...

20:14.359 --> 20:17.487
I am not allowed to stand in one place.
My days are filled with battles.

20:17.529 --> 20:19.520
But...

20:19.564 --> 20:21.327
I'm glad I was able to meet you...

20:22.634 --> 20:23.726
What?

20:23.768 --> 20:26.430
Let's cruise together
like this forever...

20:26.471 --> 20:27.961
I won't let you go home tonight.

20:28.006 --> 20:29.598
Oh, my!

20:32.598 --> 20:36.598
