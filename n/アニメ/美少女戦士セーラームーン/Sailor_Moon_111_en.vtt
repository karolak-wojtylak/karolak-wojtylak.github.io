00:02.000 --> 00:04.127
An evil trap by Eugeal!!

00:04.169 --> 00:08.401
There were talismans inside Uranus
and Neptune's pure heart crystals!

00:11.543 --> 00:14.341
Haruka, Michiru -- don't die!!

00:14.379 --> 00:19.840
Just watch! Even if there aren't any
talismans, I WILL save the world!!

00:30.700 --> 00:31.928
Uranus...

00:31.968 --> 00:33.902
What should I do?

00:33.936 --> 00:38.066
How can I return these
talismans to your bodies?

00:38.741 --> 00:40.333
Buns-head...

00:40.376 --> 00:43.277
No, Sailor Moon...

00:43.813 --> 00:46.611
I don't care what happens to us...

00:46.649 --> 00:50.710
Please, protect these talismans...

00:50.753 --> 00:54.883
And find the one remaining talisman.

00:55.158 --> 00:56.318
Haruka!

01:03.099 --> 01:07.263
Hand the Grail to
the legendary Messiah...

01:10.339 --> 01:12.102
The legendary Messiah...?

01:12.141 --> 01:13.608
Who is that...?

01:14.076 --> 01:19.480
Our savior, who can rescue us
from the time of destruction...

01:19.515 --> 01:24.452
...the horrible world of silence...

01:37.366 --> 01:41.496
When the Messiah gets a hold
of the Grail, the world...

01:41.537 --> 01:44.062
...will be saved...

01:51.380 --> 01:54.144
NOOOOOO!!

02:06.963 --> 02:09.329
I can hear it.

02:09.365 --> 02:12.095
It's faint, but I hear a pulse!

02:13.369 --> 02:15.360
Dammit! How can we
return these talismans...

02:15.404 --> 02:19.272
...these crystals of their
pure hearts... back inside them!?

02:33.322 --> 02:35.916
Sure enough, I have
received the two talismans.

02:36.525 --> 02:37.822
You can't do that!

02:40.096 --> 02:43.532
MOON COSMIC POWER...

02:43.566 --> 02:46.091
MAKE UP!

03:18.167 --> 03:23.332
Those two talismans are the crystals
of Haruka and Michiru's pure hearts!

03:23.372 --> 03:24.304
Give them back!!

03:24.507 --> 03:25.997
FIRE...

03:28.577 --> 03:31.102
...BUSTER!!

03:44.560 --> 03:49.361
How is the power of Fire Buster II, with
its pending practicality model patent...

03:49.398 --> 03:51.662
...now with even more
firepower than before?

03:55.504 --> 03:57.563
SHINE AQUA...

03:57.606 --> 03:59.665
...ILLUSION!

04:02.945 --> 04:06.472
I can't believe Shine Aqua
Illusion didn't work!

04:06.515 --> 04:08.676
An eye for an eye, a fame for a fame!

04:10.019 --> 04:16.151
BURNING...

04:16.192 --> 04:18.717
...MANDALA!

04:21.964 --> 04:23.158
Mars, it's no good!

04:23.199 --> 04:25.463
The fire grew even bigger!

04:27.636 --> 04:32.471
Your attacks will not be able to
extinguish the fame of my Fire Buster.

04:34.844 --> 04:40.077
Now you'll all burn to a crisp,
into crispy black charred masses!

04:41.484 --> 04:42.246
See you!

04:42.852 --> 04:46.253
If we don't think of something,
we'll all die!

04:50.760 --> 04:52.250
LUNA-P...

04:52.294 --> 04:53.488
...FIRE EXTINGUISHER!

04:56.966 --> 04:58.194
Sailor Chibi Moon!

04:58.234 --> 05:00.225
Tuxedo Mask!

05:07.109 --> 05:09.543
I was wondering what
was gonna happen to us!

05:09.578 --> 05:11.842
Whew, I'm glad we made it in time.

05:12.181 --> 05:16.117
Thank you, Sailor Chibi Moon,
Tuxedo Mask.

05:16.519 --> 05:18.077
Hurry, the talismans...

05:18.120 --> 05:18.950
Right!

05:23.993 --> 05:27.451
Wait for me, Uranus, Neptune!

05:27.496 --> 05:32.627
I will make sure... I will make
sure to get the talismans back!

05:48.350 --> 05:52.286
I... I was able to
obtain TWO talismans!!

05:55.324 --> 05:57.121
Damn those pesky girls!

06:00.963 --> 06:02.123
STICKY LIQUID!

06:04.467 --> 06:06.059
What!?

06:07.970 --> 06:08.994
M-My legs...

06:09.038 --> 06:11.404
...are stuck.

06:12.374 --> 06:14.899
Take this!

06:16.712 --> 06:18.339
Now... there!

06:18.380 --> 06:20.848
And... there!

06:30.259 --> 06:31.226
See you later!

06:33.662 --> 06:35.323
Watch out, Sailor Moon!

06:35.364 --> 06:36.160
Eugeal is...!

06:37.032 --> 06:39.159
W-What should I do? What should I do?
What should I do? What should I do?

06:44.373 --> 06:46.273
Sorry, guys!

06:46.742 --> 06:47.572
Sorry!

06:47.610 --> 06:49.771
I'm really sorry! I'm sorry!
There! And there!

06:51.447 --> 06:55.144
She's just like the
white rabbit of Inaba...

06:55.184 --> 06:57.209
Does that make us sharks?

06:58.187 --> 06:58.812
D-Did it hurt!?

06:58.854 --> 07:01.755
I won't forgive you if you
let Eugeal get away now!

07:01.790 --> 07:03.189
Do your best, Sailor Moon!

07:03.225 --> 07:05.056
We'll make sure to follow you!

07:14.270 --> 07:15.794
I have to save them!

07:16.338 --> 07:19.796
I have to get the crystals of
Uranus and Neptune's pure hearts...

07:20.376 --> 07:23.812
I have to get those talismans back!

07:47.803 --> 07:49.202
So you're here!

07:49.238 --> 07:51.832
I can't forgive you for
stepping on someone's heart...

07:51.874 --> 07:54.502
...and then trying to do
away with their life as well!

07:54.944 --> 07:56.241
For love and justice...

07:56.278 --> 07:58.508
The pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

08:02.985 --> 08:04.509
Sailor Moon!

08:06.121 --> 08:09.784
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!!

08:16.532 --> 08:17.624
Acting tough, are we?

08:19.435 --> 08:24.805
I do hope you remember that I defended
myself against your ultimate attack before.

08:26.842 --> 08:30.642
It's obvious that I'm much
more powerful than you are.

08:30.679 --> 08:36.049
If you don't want to die, it would be
better for you to run away right now!

08:36.585 --> 08:41.045
Even if my body breaks, I'll make sure
that those talismans are back in my hands!

09:01.243 --> 09:05.680
MOON SPIRAL...

09:05.714 --> 09:08.080
FIRE...

09:08.117 --> 09:12.349
...HEART ATTACK!!

09:14.023 --> 09:16.548
...BUSTER!!

09:24.733 --> 09:26.633
Just like I told you...

09:26.669 --> 09:30.435
Fire Buster II is a
wonderful piece of equipment.

09:30.472 --> 09:33.032
I made it by making
alterations to Fire Buster I.

09:33.075 --> 09:37.478
That weak little attack of
yours is nothing against it!

10:18.754 --> 10:23.020
Sailor Moon, you have gotten
in my way so many times before...

10:23.559 --> 10:27.017
Today, I will give my thanks
for all of those times!

10:36.271 --> 10:37.363
FIRE...

10:37.406 --> 10:39.806
Hold it right there!

10:44.113 --> 10:45.671
Who are you!?

10:45.714 --> 10:47.511
Miss Setsuna Meioh?

10:47.549 --> 10:50.916
Eugeal, I will have you
return the talismans to us.

10:50.953 --> 10:52.045
What!?

10:52.087 --> 10:54.055
Sailor Moon!

10:54.089 --> 10:55.920
Who are you?

10:55.958 --> 10:58.392
PLUTO PLANET POWER...

10:58.427 --> 11:00.827
MAKE UP!

11:16.011 --> 11:17.308
You're...!

11:17.346 --> 11:18.779
Sailor Pluto!

11:19.581 --> 11:21.014
It has been a while.

11:21.049 --> 11:22.277
Why are you here?

11:23.585 --> 11:26.281
The remaining talisman...

11:27.156 --> 11:29.283
...is in my possession!

11:38.801 --> 11:40.200
This is perfect...

11:40.235 --> 11:43.432
I don't have to go
searching for the third one.

11:47.376 --> 11:52.439
I will not let you evil beings
get a hold of the talismans!!

12:04.993 --> 12:06.221
Oh, wait!

12:49.538 --> 12:50.732
Uranus!

12:50.772 --> 12:52.000
Neptune!

12:58.780 --> 13:00.509
The crystals of their pure hearts...?

13:05.254 --> 13:07.154
They're going back...

13:16.131 --> 13:17.564
I'm so glad...

13:25.941 --> 13:28.239
The true talismans...

13:28.277 --> 13:30.905
...didn't have to sacrifice anyone...

13:34.483 --> 13:38.180
Talismans... have this
much divine power?

14:02.744 --> 14:05.008
W-What just happened!?

14:19.761 --> 14:21.786
Depending on who uses it...

14:21.830 --> 14:25.027
...it is said that it can lead the
world to destruction or salvation...

14:25.534 --> 14:28.025
...it is the Holy Grail
that has infinite power.

14:31.006 --> 14:32.735
The Grail...

14:32.774 --> 14:34.639
I'll take that!

14:51.727 --> 14:53.058
I won't let you have it!

14:53.662 --> 14:55.391
You're in my way!!

15:57.492 --> 15:59.517
Sailor Moon is...!!

16:14.776 --> 16:15.868
Sailor Moon!

16:15.911 --> 16:17.538
Is this a new awakening!?

16:18.980 --> 16:20.811
Oh? My, my, my...

16:21.249 --> 16:23.877
FIRE BUSTER!!

16:38.900 --> 16:40.367
Sailor Moon is...

16:40.402 --> 16:44.338
...the Messiah that will save
the world from silence!?

16:51.546 --> 16:54.845
Dammit... Sailor Moon, I will make
sure to pay you back for this!!

17:00.055 --> 17:03.650
Chief Eugeal, your jobis over.

17:03.692 --> 17:05.091
Mimet?

17:06.862 --> 17:10.059
I've been tolerating all
of your failures until now.

17:10.098 --> 17:12.191
But they really were
unbearable to watch.

17:12.234 --> 17:13.633
W-What!?

17:13.668 --> 17:18.037
You're tarnishing the name of the
Witches 5, the pride of the Death Busters!

17:18.073 --> 17:19.665
Please die and repent for that!

17:19.708 --> 17:23.701
Die? Impossible!
The battle has just begun!

17:30.018 --> 17:32.282
T-The brakes aren't working!?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.914
What!?

17:34.956 --> 17:35.924
Snail Woman in the Station Wagon
Should Crash and Die!!

17:35.924 --> 17:38.290
Mimet!!

17:45.267 --> 17:48.759
Thanks for the hard work!

18:06.021 --> 18:07.318
Sailor Moon!

18:11.660 --> 18:13.321
Mamo-chan...

18:13.829 --> 18:14.853
Are you all right!?

18:14.896 --> 18:16.693
Hold yourself together!

18:16.731 --> 18:21.327
I'm feeling really lethargic...
I'm feeling weak all over.

18:22.270 --> 18:26.331
Perhaps Sailor Moon
isn't the Messiah...

18:28.677 --> 18:31.703
The true Messiah can
use infinite power.

18:31.746 --> 18:35.443
If she collapses from fatigue with
just this much, Sailor Moon isn't...

18:35.483 --> 18:39.078
Then, the true Messiah
is somewhere else...

18:39.855 --> 18:43.791
It looks like we have
a new mission now.

19:11.586 --> 19:15.044
Professor, the Grail has appeared!

19:16.324 --> 19:20.886
Furthermore, the Grail has landed
in the hands of the Sailor Soldiers!

19:21.963 --> 19:23.658
What's the matter?

19:23.698 --> 19:25.029
Mimet...

19:25.066 --> 19:27.261
It's true that the
Holy Grail has appeared.

19:27.302 --> 19:33.434
However, it seems that someone who can
truly control the Grail has yet to appear.

19:34.676 --> 19:39.306
If someone who could control
the Grail was really among them...

19:39.347 --> 19:41.508
...this building of
the Death Busters...

19:41.549 --> 19:46.953
...as well as all the Daimohn eggs,
should have crumbled into ruins.

19:47.389 --> 19:51.917
However, look around you.
Not one crack has emerged.

19:56.498 --> 19:58.432
Perhaps...

20:01.536 --> 20:07.031
...there is someone who can control
the Grail for us, the Death Busters...

20:07.075 --> 20:10.442
...somewhere amazingly close.

20:13.248 --> 20:15.546
I see!

20:18.546 --> 20:22.546
