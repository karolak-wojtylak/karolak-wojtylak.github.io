WEBVTT

00:02.416 --> 00:04.407
The pure love of the
boy named Umino...

00:04.451 --> 00:06.351
...tastes slightly
like a lemon.

00:06.420 --> 00:08.320
Confess your feelings,
you fried shrimp.

00:08.355 --> 00:10.346
And don't forget the julienne
cabbage on the side.

00:10.891 --> 00:12.722
I won't forgive
you for stealing...

00:12.759 --> 00:15.557
...such a delicious-sounding
pure heart of a boy!

00:15.629 --> 00:17.529
I, Sailor Moon...

00:17.597 --> 00:20.464
...will punish you in
the name of the moon!

00:34.470 --> 00:35.664
Professor.

00:35.704 --> 00:37.535
It's you, Kaorinite.

00:37.573 --> 00:38.699
Yes.

00:38.941 --> 00:42.900
A talisman is inside
lovers' pure hearts.

00:42.945 --> 00:46.244
Professor?
A new Daimohn egg...

00:46.548 --> 00:48.345
Kaorinite.

00:48.384 --> 00:54.550
How many Daimohn eggs must we
waste to retrieve the talismans...?

00:55.457 --> 00:59.188
What of the nuisances who call
themselves the Sailor Soldiers?

01:02.431 --> 01:05.059
At this rate, I can't
expect any results...

01:05.100 --> 01:08.467
...no matter how many
Daimohn eggs I throw out.

01:08.504 --> 01:11.735
Then I will head out
personally this time.

01:12.708 --> 01:14.437
All right.

01:24.987 --> 01:27.012
Leave it to me.

01:40.936 --> 01:42.563
Umino?

01:43.672 --> 01:45.697
He's not here yet?

01:45.741 --> 01:47.231
Usagi...

01:47.943 --> 01:49.877
What do you want in
a place like this?

01:49.912 --> 01:51.311
I have a secret to
talk to you about.

01:51.346 --> 01:52.973
A secret?

01:53.015 --> 01:56.178
Naru has been
acting weird lately.

01:56.218 --> 01:57.480
Weird?

01:57.519 --> 01:59.885
I can't put it
into words well...

02:00.355 --> 02:02.721
N-No, nothing's wrong.

02:03.158 --> 02:05.388
Umino... I'm sorry, but can
you go home without me?

02:05.427 --> 02:08.123
It seems like she's
hiding something from me.

02:08.664 --> 02:11.599
Stop it, I'm not
hiding anything.

02:13.502 --> 02:16.198
I'm sure it's something
she can't tell me.

02:17.072 --> 02:20.007
Maybe she has a
new boyfriend now!

02:20.309 --> 02:23.870
Everyday, for Naru, I made
her favorite: fried shrimp!

02:25.080 --> 02:27.207
Because I wanted
Naru to eat this!

02:27.249 --> 02:31.481
This fried shrimp of
sweat, tears, and love!

02:31.720 --> 02:34.484
Umino... Are you really
worried about all this?

02:37.259 --> 02:41.127
In any case, I'll casually
bring it up with Naru later.

02:43.832 --> 02:46.027
Usagi, I'm counting on you.

02:49.705 --> 02:51.036
Hey, Naru.

02:51.940 --> 02:54.135
What do you think
about Umino lately?

02:54.176 --> 02:55.871
He's been acting
weird lately.

02:56.812 --> 02:59.576
He gets really fidgety
when he's in front of me.

02:59.615 --> 03:02.379
How to say it...? Maybe he's
keeping a secret from me.

03:02.417 --> 03:04.476
What, you too, Naru?

03:04.920 --> 03:07.320
Nothing. And what
about this secret?

03:07.356 --> 03:10.257
Maybe he's got
a new girlfriend.

03:11.527 --> 03:14.257
Considering it's Umino of all
people, I'm sure it's okay!

03:14.296 --> 03:15.456
Y-You think so...?

03:15.497 --> 03:18.625
Yeah! There's no way Umino
would be so popular with girls!

03:20.068 --> 03:21.467
Well, excuse me!

03:21.503 --> 03:23.733
He does have a lot of
good things about him!

03:23.772 --> 03:24.670
Naru?

03:24.706 --> 03:26.697
I've had enough.
I'm going home!

03:26.742 --> 03:28.642
N-Naru...

03:29.745 --> 03:32.441
So, Naru thinks
about Umino, too.

03:33.248 --> 03:36.308
Oh, I get it!
This is so simple!

03:36.351 --> 03:38.251
I just have to get rid of
their misunderstandings!

03:38.287 --> 03:40.881
At times like this,
I can rely on...

03:41.089 --> 03:43.580
Leave it to Rei for all
your romance problems!

03:43.625 --> 03:44.819
Rei, of course!

03:46.128 --> 03:48.562
...and that's how it is now.

03:49.064 --> 03:52.056
Oh, if they care about
each other, it's easy.

03:52.601 --> 03:54.626
All we need to do is
have them confirm...

03:54.670 --> 03:56.604
...their feelings for
each other, right?

03:56.638 --> 03:59.505
Yeah. It's just like you, Rei,
to say something good.

03:59.541 --> 04:02.203
There's a perfect event
for such a situation!

04:02.244 --> 04:03.370
Ta-dah!

04:03.612 --> 04:05.307
Oh? Lovers' Park?

04:05.347 --> 04:07.144
Yup! As part ofthe
grand opening...

04:07.182 --> 04:08.945
...they're having
an affection contest.

04:08.984 --> 04:11.544
If we can get Umino and
Naru to participate...

04:11.987 --> 04:13.420
That's great! A great idea!

04:13.455 --> 04:16.390
The winners get to
light a flame of love...

04:16.425 --> 04:18.222
...in a heart-
shaped monument!

04:18.594 --> 04:21.290
That's so lovely! I'd love
to do that with Mamo-chan!

04:21.330 --> 04:23.764
Idiot! What are you going
to do by entering, Usagi?

04:24.266 --> 04:27.258
Their love will deepen as
a result of the contest!

04:27.302 --> 04:29.065
Then, Mamo-chan
and I could--

04:29.104 --> 04:31.868
As I was saying,
if you win the contest...

04:31.907 --> 04:33.602
...you'll ruin
their relationship!

04:33.642 --> 04:34.904
Oh, I get it...

04:35.911 --> 04:38.141
Rei, you're so smart!

04:38.180 --> 04:41.115
It's first come, first serve,
so better apply early.

04:41.149 --> 04:42.241
Yeah!

04:45.988 --> 04:47.649
Hurry, hurry!

04:47.689 --> 04:49.452
Where are you going, Usagi?

04:49.524 --> 04:53.824
Don't worry about
that yet. Leave it to me!

04:53.862 --> 04:54.886
Let's go!

04:54.930 --> 04:56.295
Here!

05:00.002 --> 05:01.435
T-That can't be...

05:01.470 --> 05:03.131
- Usagi!
- Usagi...!

05:03.205 --> 05:04.399
What's wrong?

05:04.439 --> 05:08.705
I wanted you two to make up
by entering this contest...

05:11.713 --> 05:13.840
- Usagi, actually...
- Usagi, actually...

05:15.050 --> 05:16.847
See?

05:17.452 --> 05:18.316
Umino!

05:18.353 --> 05:19.945
Naru...

05:20.956 --> 05:25.256
A-Actually, I wanted to
enter the contest with Naru....

05:25.294 --> 05:28.457
Then you should
have said so earlier.

05:28.497 --> 05:31.898
I thought so as well, but I
didn't quite get a chance to...

05:31.933 --> 05:34.527
That's why you
were so fidgety.

05:34.569 --> 05:36.400
Sheesh! You can
be such an idiot!

05:36.438 --> 05:37.837
You say that...

05:37.873 --> 05:40.501
...but you were feeling
the same way, Naru!

05:40.542 --> 05:42.908
I-I wasn't as bad as Umino...

05:47.716 --> 05:51.618
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

05:51.653 --> 05:53.018
All right!

05:53.055 --> 05:54.682
Ouch!

05:55.057 --> 05:57.924
Now I'm perfectly ready
for tomorrow's contest!

05:57.959 --> 06:00.325
I have to go to sleep early
tonight to prepare for it!

06:00.796 --> 06:02.627
One sheep. Baa...

06:03.398 --> 06:06.060
Two sheep.
Baa... Baa...

06:06.101 --> 06:08.069
I can't be nervous.
I have to go to sleep.

06:08.103 --> 06:09.400
Four sheep.

06:09.438 --> 06:11.736
Oh, wait, the third
sheep got lost.

06:31.493 --> 06:35.589
30,003 sheep.
Baa... Baa...

06:35.630 --> 06:36.995
Baa! Baa!

06:37.032 --> 06:39.694
I have to sleep!
I have to sleep soon!

06:39.735 --> 06:42.101
Baa! Baa! BAA!

06:44.973 --> 06:48.602
I feel an evil presence
in this park.

06:50.011 --> 06:53.503
I'm sure there will be
a Daimohn around here.

06:54.383 --> 06:58.149
I won't let them
have the talisman.

06:58.653 --> 06:59.881
Now both of you, do your best.

06:59.921 --> 07:01.252
Y-Yeah. We'll do our best.

07:01.289 --> 07:02.813
Umino, are you all right?

07:02.858 --> 07:05.019
- YES!
- He doesn't look all right...

07:06.395 --> 07:08.727
Huh? Everyone!

07:08.764 --> 07:10.459
Oh, there she is.

07:10.499 --> 07:12.262
What are you
guys doing here?

07:12.868 --> 07:14.233
To cheer those two on!

07:14.269 --> 07:16.169
I'm wherever there is romance!

07:16.204 --> 07:17.899
It seems a little fun, too.

07:17.939 --> 07:21.204
I was thinking I could
make use of it someday...

07:21.243 --> 07:22.369
For what?

07:22.411 --> 07:25.278
D-Don't take me seriously.
It was just a play on words.

07:25.947 --> 07:28.780
Huh? It's Haruka and Michiru.

07:28.817 --> 07:29.749
Wonderful!

07:29.785 --> 07:31.582
I wonder if they're in
the contest as well.

07:31.620 --> 07:32.985
Two girls together?

07:33.021 --> 07:35.683
But looking at them like this,
it's like they really were lovers...

07:36.958 --> 07:41.622
Everyone, the affection
contest is about to begin!

07:41.663 --> 07:43.324
Please gather at the stage!

07:43.365 --> 07:45.196
Well, let's go cheer them on!

07:46.268 --> 07:49.704
Everyone, are you
living full of love?

07:50.005 --> 07:52.599
The couples here are
the selected people...

07:52.641 --> 07:54.472
...who are overflowing in love!

07:54.509 --> 07:56.704
And today, we'll
have these couples...

07:56.745 --> 07:59.578
...compare how deep their
feelings of love are!

07:59.614 --> 08:02.549
The winning couple will be
the couple with a pure heart...

08:02.584 --> 08:05.075
...that love each
other the most!

08:06.621 --> 08:08.145
Go for it, Naru!

08:08.190 --> 08:09.487
Hold yourself together, Umino!

08:09.524 --> 08:11.151
You look wonderful, Michiru!

08:11.193 --> 08:13.320
Look over here, Haruka!

08:13.361 --> 08:14.089
Come on...

08:14.129 --> 08:16.597
Who did you come
here to cheer on?

08:16.631 --> 08:19.259
That's what you call a
sudden change of heart.

08:19.301 --> 08:20.962
- Oh, is that so?
- I'm sorry!

08:21.002 --> 08:23.402
The first game is
just a small test.

08:23.438 --> 08:27.033
Let's have them guess their lover's
hand that appears through the hole!

08:27.075 --> 08:29.066
Begin, from those
that figured it out!

08:31.513 --> 08:33.481
T-This sure was a fast one!

08:36.751 --> 08:37.945
It's Haruka...

08:37.986 --> 08:41.114
I wonder if they really are
in THAT kind of a relationship.

08:42.123 --> 08:45.581
Now, scream out
your lover's name!

08:45.627 --> 08:46.889
What!?

08:48.663 --> 08:52.030
Can you tell us
your lover's name?

08:52.067 --> 08:54.797
You sure want me to do
something really cheap.

08:55.303 --> 08:58.932
I'm begging you. It's just
what the script says.

08:58.974 --> 09:00.339
Michiru.

09:03.945 --> 09:05.412
Success! A correct guess!

09:05.447 --> 09:06.812
Now, let's keep
going at this pace!

09:06.848 --> 09:09.214
- They did it!
- Next up is Umino!

09:09.251 --> 09:11.048
Which one is
Naru's hand?

09:12.721 --> 09:14.712
Here, Umino,
take a handkerchief.

09:14.756 --> 09:16.417
Make sure to wipe
yourself dry.

09:16.558 --> 09:19.823
T-That's it!
Naru's hand is...

09:19.861 --> 09:20.885
...this one!

09:21.162 --> 09:23.892
Now, call out your
girlfriend's name!

09:23.932 --> 09:26.526
Naru, my angel...

09:26.568 --> 09:27.592
You're wrong!

09:27.636 --> 09:29.968
Sorry, you made a mistake.

09:30.005 --> 09:31.336
Oh, well...

09:31.373 --> 09:32.465
T-That can't be!

09:32.507 --> 09:34.338
I'm sure Naru had
a Band-Aid on her finger...

09:34.376 --> 09:36.003
What are you doing!?
That hurts!

09:36.811 --> 09:39.006
Sheesh. There's no way I
would still have a wound...

09:39.047 --> 09:41.311
...from six months ago
on my finger, Umino!

09:42.083 --> 09:45.280
But he still remembered
something from that far back...

09:45.320 --> 09:46.480
Are you all right?

09:46.521 --> 09:47.545
Yes.

09:47.889 --> 09:51.086
Nothing compared to the pain
Naru's heart is feeling!

09:52.360 --> 09:54.089
Naru, please forgive me!!

09:54.129 --> 09:56.689
Let's go to our
next contestant...

09:56.731 --> 09:58.961
They sure try hard.
It's only a game.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.467
It is, but...

10:01.570 --> 10:06.030
I think being able to become
that serious is a wonderful thing.

10:06.608 --> 10:08.838
It's not just
a game for him...

10:35.937 --> 10:38.701
The three-legged race
of love! START!

10:42.911 --> 10:44.742
The karaoke of love!

10:46.815 --> 10:49.340
"A sea turtle's egg..."

10:49.384 --> 10:51.284
Wrong song, Umino...

10:52.053 --> 10:53.350
Pitiful.

10:53.388 --> 10:56.016
But he has the best
heart of them all.

10:56.691 --> 10:59.159
He's taking this
so seriously.

11:00.729 --> 11:02.890
I'll admit to that.

11:03.264 --> 11:05.459
It would be nice
if they could win...

11:06.735 --> 11:09.704
Now, it's finally
the last game!

11:09.771 --> 11:13.434
Even the ones who've been losing
have a shot at turning it around!

11:13.475 --> 11:17.104
It's the Confess
Your Love Game!

11:17.312 --> 11:21.442
You in the audience are
going to award them points!

11:21.483 --> 11:23.474
We'll determine how many points
by the volume of the applause!

11:23.518 --> 11:24.815
Are you ready!?

11:24.853 --> 11:26.047
YEAH!

11:26.087 --> 11:28.385
Starting with these two!

11:28.423 --> 11:31.415
Now, a confession
from him to her!

11:31.459 --> 11:33.586
Show is over.

11:33.628 --> 11:36.893
I said the show is over.
We'll drop out of this one.

11:36.931 --> 11:38.558
But...

11:38.600 --> 11:42.058
We weren't taking this
seriously to begin with...

11:42.103 --> 11:45.004
...and it looks like
we'd win at this rate.

11:45.273 --> 11:48.037
True love is
what needs to win.

11:49.310 --> 11:50.902
Love...

11:51.346 --> 11:53.439
Love is everything!

11:56.618 --> 11:58.381
So, with that...

11:59.154 --> 12:00.485
Farewell!

12:00.522 --> 12:03.286
Encore! Encore!

12:03.324 --> 12:05.918
N-Now, the next
couple, please.

12:06.261 --> 12:08.092
Hanako... Come with me.

12:08.129 --> 12:09.653
Takao...

12:10.432 --> 12:11.524
I'm so happy!

12:11.566 --> 12:13.932
Hanako... You have bad
eyesight, don't you?

12:16.705 --> 12:19.902
Love is, love is...

12:20.041 --> 12:22.441
...a BATTLE!!

12:23.878 --> 12:25.812
L-Love is to endure...

12:25.880 --> 12:27.541
Red wins!

12:28.049 --> 12:31.450
Now, it's finally time
for the last couple!

12:31.486 --> 12:32.919
Come on!

12:33.788 --> 12:36.484
- We've been waiting for this!
- Umino, do it well!

12:36.691 --> 12:38.852
N-Naru!

12:42.297 --> 12:43.525
Umino!

12:44.065 --> 12:45.896
Is he all right...?

12:45.934 --> 12:47.026
Umino...

12:48.603 --> 12:50.036
Naru...

12:51.139 --> 12:56.042
Naru, you're always
bright, just like the sun.

12:56.644 --> 12:57.872
Umino...

12:57.912 --> 13:00.881
I'm always being
such a klutz...

13:00.915 --> 13:04.078
...and I might not be worthy
of someone like you, Naru.

13:04.986 --> 13:08.979
Why do you continue to
see someone like me...?

13:09.023 --> 13:12.652
Maybe it's just
a whim of God.

13:14.028 --> 13:16.121
When I think that...

13:16.164 --> 13:17.256
B-But!

13:17.298 --> 13:21.029
I'm happy just by seeing
your smile, Naru.

13:21.636 --> 13:24.161
For Naru's
angelic smile...

13:24.205 --> 13:27.174
...and to protect
your beautiful smile...

13:27.208 --> 13:31.269
I... I, Gurio Umino...

13:32.714 --> 13:34.443
...can die!

13:34.749 --> 13:36.910
U-Umino...

13:38.052 --> 13:39.610
Umino...

13:45.059 --> 13:47.050
Now, what do you
think of this couple?

13:47.695 --> 13:49.162
Great!

13:50.632 --> 13:53.123
You're the best in Japan!

13:53.535 --> 13:55.196
Such an ovation!

13:55.236 --> 13:59.002
By unanimous vote,
this couple is the winner!

14:01.776 --> 14:04.973
Now, both of you,
light the flame of love!

14:05.647 --> 14:07.205
Umino, we did it!

14:07.248 --> 14:08.738
Y-Yes.

14:13.655 --> 14:16.818
This is the proof of
Naru's and my love...

14:17.792 --> 14:19.783
Naru's and my...

14:22.831 --> 14:23.820
What?

14:26.601 --> 14:28.091
What is it!?

14:38.880 --> 14:40.973
DIE HEART!

14:41.382 --> 14:43.350
Umino! Run!

14:43.384 --> 14:45.978
The monument of the love
between us, Naru...!

14:46.020 --> 14:47.783
Just hurry!

14:47.822 --> 14:49.949
Inside the pure heart
which thinks of...

14:49.991 --> 14:51.891
...one's lover,
we find a talisman.

14:54.462 --> 14:55.929
Dammit!

14:59.734 --> 15:01.463
Look out, Naru!

15:02.270 --> 15:03.294
Umino!

15:06.174 --> 15:08.267
- Umino!
- Umino!

15:10.278 --> 15:15.682
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

15:47.081 --> 15:51.450
MERCURY STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

15:55.323 --> 16:00.488
MARS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

16:03.398 --> 16:07.835
JUPITER STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

16:13.374 --> 16:17.470
VENUS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

16:26.287 --> 16:27.982
I've found it.

16:29.891 --> 16:31.358
Hold it right there!

16:31.392 --> 16:32.689
Who is it, HEART?

16:32.727 --> 16:36.163
To ruin the light of love that
they finally got a hold of...!

16:36.197 --> 16:37.664
Umino!

16:37.699 --> 16:39.530
Even if the cupid of
love forgave you...

16:39.567 --> 16:41.296
...I won't forgive you!

16:42.236 --> 16:45.467
For love and justice, the pretty
soldier in a sailor suit!

16:45.506 --> 16:47.269
Sailor Moon!

16:47.308 --> 16:49.003
Likewise, Sailor Mars!

16:49.043 --> 16:50.635
Sailor Mercury!

16:50.678 --> 16:51.804
Sailor Venus!

16:51.846 --> 16:53.074
Sailor Jupiter!

16:54.882 --> 16:58.340
In the name of the moon,
I punish you!

17:00.855 --> 17:01.844
You're...!

17:01.889 --> 17:05.552
Little ladies...
Girls should behave like girls.

17:08.429 --> 17:11.023
LET'S DANCING!

17:14.969 --> 17:16.630
LET'S DANCING!

17:16.671 --> 17:18.263
LET'S DANCING!

17:18.306 --> 17:20.501
W-Well, just for a little bit.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.270
Your hand...

17:22.310 --> 17:23.743
Sure...

17:46.834 --> 17:49.894
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Uranus...

17:49.937 --> 17:51.962
...acts with elegance!

17:53.474 --> 17:56.068
Likewise, Sailor Neptune...

17:56.110 --> 17:58.101
...acts with grace!

17:59.547 --> 18:03.039
Die Heart, provide dance partners
for these girls as well.

18:03.084 --> 18:04.051
DIE HEART!

18:04.085 --> 18:06.645
I'll find my
own dance partner!

18:09.290 --> 18:12.748
WORLD SHAKING!

18:17.331 --> 18:19.299
DIE HEART!

18:20.301 --> 18:22.531
It's no time to be
fooled by illusions.

18:22.570 --> 18:23.764
R-Right!

18:26.174 --> 18:28.074
No matter how
many you defeat...

18:28.109 --> 18:31.135
...we can make more
and more Daimohn eggs.

18:31.412 --> 18:33.209
Then we will defeat you!

18:33.247 --> 18:35.442
We'll settle the score now.

18:36.484 --> 18:37.951
Is that so?

18:39.854 --> 18:42.288
You need 10 more years of
training to fight me!

18:42.623 --> 18:43.647
See you.

18:44.425 --> 18:45.357
Dammit!

18:45.393 --> 18:48.191
Umino! Umino,
please, answer me!

18:48.229 --> 18:50.060
Quick, the crystal!

18:50.098 --> 18:51.224
DIE HEART!

18:51.265 --> 18:53.825
It's not it...
It's not a talisman.

18:53.868 --> 18:54.994
Who are you?

18:55.036 --> 18:57.061
Take good care of him.

19:03.945 --> 19:05.640
Umino! I'm so glad!

19:05.680 --> 19:06.840
Naru?

19:07.381 --> 19:08.780
DIE HEART!

19:08.816 --> 19:11.478
That trick won't
work this time!

19:31.572 --> 19:39.104
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

19:50.158 --> 19:53.423
LOVELY!

20:02.537 --> 20:05.267
Now, turn the switches on!

20:05.306 --> 20:07.866
Applause for
the happy couple!

20:10.444 --> 20:11.502
I'm so happy for them.

20:11.546 --> 20:13.446
Yeah, it's thanks
to you, Rei!

20:13.481 --> 20:15.005
Umino looks happy.

20:15.049 --> 20:16.914
He really did do his best.

20:16.951 --> 20:18.816
I'm jealous.
I wish I could...

20:19.754 --> 20:21.915
Even you, Umino the klutz,
did your best.

20:21.956 --> 20:22.888
Y-Yeah...

20:22.924 --> 20:24.448
By the way, what's
for lunch tomorrow?

20:24.492 --> 20:27.427
I'm so happy, I'll be
making fried lobsters!

20:27.461 --> 20:29.122
But is that yummy?

20:29.163 --> 20:29.959
I don't know...

20:29.997 --> 20:31.965
Sheesh, Umino!

20:34.965 --> 20:38.965
