1
00:00:01,882 --> 00:00:04,544
Haruka is attractive,
after all...

2
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:08,652
Mako-chan, you shouldn't!
Haruka is a girl!

3
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:11,021
What is that dangerous
look in your eyes!?

4
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:14,653
While we're saying things like that,
the enemy attacks Mako-chan!

5
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:17,357
F-For now... I, Sailor Moon...

6
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:20,161
...will punish you in
the name of the moon!

7
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,601
Oh, boy,
I'm so hungry...

8
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:46,730
And there's another
study group session tonight.

9
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:48,138
It's all about your guts!

10
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:52,201
I'll bring roast beef sandwiches
to tonight's study group, too.

11
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:54,736
Really!? I'm so lucky!

12
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:59,047
Everyone should have friends
who are talented at cooking!

13
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:01,615
Mako-chan, I love you!

14
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:05,113
My cooking isn't about talent.

15
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:10,290
I just think that
big, boyish girls...

16
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,025
...need to be good at
something like cooking.

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,260
So I find myself trying hard.

18
00:01:18,738 --> 00:01:23,004
Even if you couldn't cook,
you're feminine enough, Mako-chan.

19
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,468
Thanks...

20
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:29,005
- I mean it.
- Really?

21
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,778
Yeah. When I first
met you, Mako-chan...

22
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:34,548
...I was thinking what
a cute person you were!

23
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:36,919
You're praising me too much!
But that makes me happy...

24
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:39,220
...so I'll give you an
extra-large portion, Usagi.

25
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:42,458
I did it!

26
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:49,695
Usagi!

27
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:57,202
Sorry!
Are you all right?

28
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,983
Are you injured!?
Does it hurt anywhere!?

29
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:13,257
Ow...

30
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:14,950
Haruka...

31
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:16,621
Did you hit your head..?

32
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:19,995
Oh, no, I'm all right.
What about you, Mako-chan?

33
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:25,665
You, over there.
You're bleeding a bit.

34
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:28,966
Huh? You're right.

35
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,703
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,211
No, I'm fine if
it's only this much.

37
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:39,176
I was just thinking a
little about something...

38
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:41,983
...so I wasn't paying attention
to what was in front of me.

39
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:44,216
I have no excuse for this.

40
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:47,115
No, it's all right...

41
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,166
You're brave, and you look
out for your friends.

42
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,305
I'm sorry to have
surprised you.

43
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:07,312
No, no...

44
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,711
See ya!

45
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,049
Bye!

46
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:18,857
Mako-chan, thanks
for covering for... me...

47
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:27,227
Mako-chan?

48
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,426
You shouldn't!

49
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:31,994
Even if she's really attractive,
Haruka is a female!

50
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,364
Sheesh...!
W-What are you saying?

51
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:37,740
Of course!
It's nothing like that!

52
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:44,415
You're right,
what AM I saying?

53
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:59,887
We have to find the
messiah at any cost.

54
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:04,665
The three talismans that are
the key to finding the messiah...

55
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:07,036
...are sealed
inside pure hearts.

56
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,604
I will make sure they
fall into our hands.

57
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:14,704
Even if we sacrifice the
owner of that pure heart?

58
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:19,016
Even if we sacrifice the
owner of that pure heart.

59
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:21,744
For world peace?

60
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:24,221
For world peace.

61
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:26,087
We have little time left.

62
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,355
Silence is soon
approaching us...

63
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:34,258
You're right. We have
to find the messiah.

64
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,131
At any cost.

65
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:48,479
The sea is in an uproar.

66
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,917
Yeah, it's around here.

67
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,715
I feel a presence,
but it's not moving yet.

68
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:59,752
Hey, does anyone know
where Haruka's house is?

69
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:01,721
No, I haven't asked.

70
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:04,161
Haruka?
You mean THAT Haruka?

71
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:07,996
What are you going to
do with her address?

72
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,766
W-Well, I have to
return this to her!

73
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:25,047
The target has
been confirmed.

74
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:36,658
W-Wait!

75
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,754
If I don't have that, I don't
have an excuse to see Haruka!

76
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,265
Excuse...?

77
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,565
Wait!

78
00:05:50,843 --> 00:05:52,401
Where did it fall...?

79
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,780
It's not here...

80
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:00,579
It's there!

81
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:09,786
Just a bit more!

82
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:29,742
Got it!

83
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,014
SCAR...

84
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,517
W-W-W-What is that!?

85
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:44,654
SCAR...

86
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:49,825
I will take your
pure heart, SCAR!

87
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:53,000
- That's...!
- A Daimohn!

88
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,733
- Mako-cha--
- Let's transform!

89
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:55,797
Oh, sure thing.

90
00:06:57,776 --> 00:07:02,907
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

91
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:38,673
MERCURY STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

92
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:54,829
SCAR...

93
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:03,034
SHINE AQUA ILLUSION!

94
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:07,943
SCAR!

95
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:11,345
What are you doing
so early in the morning!?

96
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:13,943
Get away from that girl!

97
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:17,382
I'm already interrupted.

98
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:19,516
For now, retreat, Scar!

99
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,726
SCAR!

100
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:25,389
It's flying!?

101
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:32,529
W-What in the
world is that?

102
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,472
That girl is the
target this time.

103
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:43,675
I couldn't tell if she was
the owner of a talisman.

104
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:47,452
Sailor Moon sure did
something unnecessary.

105
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,380
Why don't we tell them
everything and fight together?

106
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,683
Silence is approaching.

107
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:59,528
To stop it, we must
sacrifice someone.

108
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:01,692
Can they do that?

109
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:03,861
So, what are
we going to do?

110
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:06,200
They'll be after
her again.

111
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:08,399
We have to keep an eye
on her for a while.

112
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,461
Mako-chan! Let's go home!

113
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:41,871
Oh? Ms. Kino went home already.

114
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:47,735
That's funny...
Where did it go?

115
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,179
Mako-chan!

116
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:52,983
What are you doing here
all by yourself?

117
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:54,212
Oh, I'm sorry.

118
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:56,517
Actually, I haven't
found Haruka's scarf...

119
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,420
...since I lost it
here this morning.

120
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:02,422
Y-You know, Mako-chan, I told
you this yesterday, too...

121
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,656
I-I've been saying
it's nothing like that.

122
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:06,289
Are you sure?

123
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:08,323
I'm sure!

124
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:13,631
Hi. I'm glad I bumped
into you again today.

125
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,964
Haruka...

126
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:17,839
I have something to ask you.

127
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,901
Do you mind joining me?

128
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:22,778
Do you mean me?
S-Sure!

129
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:27,216
Mako-chan, don't you think
there's a slight problem here?

130
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,517
What, girls can't go
on a drive together?

131
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:34,981
I wasn't saying that...

132
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:36,324
Then it's all right.

133
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:38,592
I'll borrow your
friend for a bit.

134
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,461
You'll come with me, right?

135
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:41,830
S-Sure!

136
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,892
M-Mako-chan?

137
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,465
I don't care about
this anymore...

138
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,038
That's Michiru.
She's in the same grade as I.

139
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,706
I believe we've
met once before.

140
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:57,079
Nice to meet you.

141
00:10:57,116 --> 00:11:02,144
I-I see... Same grade?
How old are you two?

142
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,756
We're in tenth grade.

143
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,886
Tenth grade? Then is it all
right for you to drive a car?

144
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:11,290
Is it all right?

145
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,063
Let's see... I-I got
a license overseas.

146
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:20,997
So she says.

147
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:25,509
Those are pretty ear rings.
They look good on you.

148
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:28,603
Do you think so...?

149
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,279
Was it bad for us to
force you like this?

150
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,375
No, not at all!

151
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:38,187
So, what did you want to ask me?

152
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:41,492
I want to be better
friends with you...

153
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,897
A DATE!?

154
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:51,493
Y-Yeah...

155
00:11:51,537 --> 00:11:54,335
But it's with a woman.

156
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:55,863
A woman?

157
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:57,466
This is a problem...

158
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,977
Did Mako-chan's
preferences change?

159
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,377
It's not that!

160
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:04,211
And it was Haruka
she went off with!

161
00:12:04,783 --> 00:12:07,445
I can't laugh that one off.

162
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,385
No matter how
attractive she is...

163
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:12,219
...I can't believe that
she's chasing after women.

164
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:13,554
It's not that!

165
00:12:13,592 --> 00:12:17,050
But, Rei, you have THIS, too!

166
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:21,465
Don't pull out other people's
books without their permission!

167
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,365
That's not the problem!

168
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:30,606
W-We shouldn't leave
Mako-chan alone.

169
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:34,544
The enemy is after Mako-chan's
pure heart this time!

170
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,313
Y-Yeah...

171
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:46,851
I'm pretty close...
I'm at Kaiouzu Park.

172
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,689
We'll be right there.

173
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,958
I'm all right. If an enemy
comes, I'll defeat it.

174
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:55,128
Please, let me do what
I want for today.

175
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:05,307
- Mako-chan! Mako-chan!
- Don't give up!

176
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:08,575
That's right! There are plenty of
good-looking guys in the world!

177
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:10,343
Sheesh, no wisn't
the time for--

178
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:11,781
But this is a
big problem, too!

179
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:14,012
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
problem for Mako-chan!

180
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:17,317
It's all right. It's really
nothing like that.

181
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:20,123
I don't know how
to say this...

182
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:22,558
You know how Haruka
is attractive, right?

183
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,926
I just look up to someone
that attractive...

184
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,835
SCAR!

185
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:34,203
SCAR!

186
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:35,263
SCAR!

187
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,941
- Mako-chan!
- Mako-chan!

188
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:48,510
Your pure heart that looks
up to your ideal woman!

189
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:49,646
This time, I will...

190
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,591
Haruka!

191
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,150
You monster!
Let go of Mako-chan!

192
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:59,163
You can't!
Run, both of you! Hurry!

193
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:02,196
It's dangerous
to throw rocks!

194
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,836
Haruka! Michiru!

195
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:10,865
The interruptions
have disappeared.

196
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:13,878
Scar, take the pure
heart from that girl!

197
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:18,973
SCAR!

198
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:31,725
Right according to plan.

199
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:34,891
Yeah... I feel sorry for her,
but we have to do this.

200
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:53,979
SCAR!

201
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,452
You're...!

202
00:14:56,755 --> 00:15:01,021
Sorry... We need the
talisman at any cost.

203
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:05,520
Damn you!
Scar! Get rid of them!

204
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:09,631
SCAR!

205
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:13,668
SCAR!

206
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,002
I won't let you have
the pure heart!

207
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,737
So, that's why they've
been hiding until now?

208
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,308
They didn't feel
anything at all...

209
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:25,145
...as they watched Haruka
and Michiru get beaten up!?

210
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:26,614
That's the end!

211
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:27,448
SCAR?

212
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:31,753
The villain that snatches
away a pure maiden's heart!

213
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,384
As a pretty soldier,
I can't forgive you!

214
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:39,655
In the name ofthe moon,
I punish you!

215
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,058
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

216
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:45,001
BURNING MANDALA!

217
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:47,203
SCAR!

218
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,340
SCAR!

219
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,169
This isn't a talisman, either.

220
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:55,577
Wait!

221
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:58,816
Please, return
this girl's heart!

222
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,780
Hurry and return it to her.

223
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,247
Hurry, Sailor Moon!

224
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:11,021
They seem to be
having a tough fight.

225
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:13,190
They're pathetic.

226
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:23,104
DEEP SUBMERGE!

227
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:28,574
SCAR!

228
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,016
Are you all right?

229
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,643
Yeah. Thanks.

230
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:39,089
- Rest for today.
- No, I can't do that...

231
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:43,885
JUPITER STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

232
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:01,574
SCAR!

233
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,215
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

234
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:10,682
Jupiter!

235
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:12,417
Now, Sailor Moon!

236
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:39,981
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

237
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:48,156
SCAR!

238
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:53,996
LOVELY!

239
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:04,007
Wait! I don't know
what you mean by this...

240
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:08,536
...but you always appear like thieves
and try to steal the pure hearts!

241
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,276
You guys are just
like the Daimohn!

242
00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:13,273
What if that's the case?

243
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,546
I can't forgive you,
especially today.

244
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:17,111
I'll straighten out that
demented mentality of yours!

245
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:27,823
Jupiter!

246
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:30,894
Jupiter!

247
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:39,205
You're being immature.
You should hold back a little.

248
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:41,472
Uranus?

249
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:44,414
She's powerful.

250
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:48,049
This is...

251
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,815
Why is it here?

252
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,753
Haruka and
Michiru are here!

253
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,190
Haruka! Haruka!

254
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:59,754
Haruka! Haruka!

255
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,764
Haruka! I'm so glad...

256
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:07,501
Oh... M-Mako-chan.

257
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,568
What about that monster?

258
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,410
She says the Sailor Soldiers
came and defeated it.

259
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,382
- I see...
- Haruka! I'm so glad!

260
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:26,347
I'm sorry...

261
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:29,660
It's because you
were with me...

262
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,628
Haruka, you
injured your hand!

263
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,068
Oh, you're right...

264
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:40,767
Huh? This is...

265
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,272
Oh, I'm sorry.

266
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,504
I intended to return
this scarf to you.

267
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,384
Haruka is
wonderful after all...

268
00:19:55,887 --> 00:20:02,952
I hope I can be a wonderful
woman like her someday.

269
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:08,028
Hey, hey, what do you think
of Mako-chan's attitude?

270
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,897
That looks rather serious.

271
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:11,197
I don't know...

272
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:14,672
Maybe it's like usual, and she
just resembled that other guy.

273
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:16,674
But isn't it a little bad?

274
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,039
Yeah, it's bad, it's bad.

275
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,737
Mako-chan?

276
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:26,737
