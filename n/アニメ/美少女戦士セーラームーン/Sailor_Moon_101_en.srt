1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,792
It's almost my birthday!

2
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:06,326
I wonder what Mamo-chan will
get me as a birthday gift!

3
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:09,636
I want wonderful
glass slippers...

4
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:11,733
But, but you over there!

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:14,711
The Daimohn that completely
ruins such an important day!

6
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:19,513
I, Sailor Moon, will punish
you in the name of the moon!

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,237
Kaorinite...

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,328
Have you found
our new target?

9
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:37,169
Yes... I'm sure
of it this time.

10
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:40,734
Oh, is that really so?

11
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:45,805
This time we have someone with
a heart of unbelievable purity.

12
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:49,318
I declare it to be a
talisman without mistake.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,589
I see... Then I will hand
you the best Daimohn I have.

14
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:19,448
You're the only one I
can count on, Kaorinite.

15
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:21,916
Thank you very much.

16
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:39,395
Today, June 30,
is my BIRTHDAY!

17
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:43,237
Congrats.

18
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:44,934
That's great...

19
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:48,274
Oh, you had a
birthday too, Usagi?

20
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,973
Let's try to act
our age from now on.

21
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:56,511
W-What coldhearted
people they are!

22
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,451
W-W-W-Wait a minute!

23
00:02:05,495 --> 00:02:07,690
Is that all you
have to say?

24
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:09,062
That's it!

25
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,067
Even if it's your
birthday today...

26
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:14,264
...don't be late for
our study group at 4:00 PM!

27
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:16,272
See ya!

28
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:18,206
T-T-This can't be happening...

29
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:20,971
You guys are all so cruel!

30
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:34,918
Wow, they're beautiful!

31
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:41,026
They're so nice...

32
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:46,195
I wish someone would give me such
beautiful shoes as a birthday gift...

33
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:52,335
I know!

34
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:05,720
It's the prince who naturally brings
Cinderella her glass slipper!

35
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,157
I'll have my prince
buy it for me!

36
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:19,361
Oh...

37
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,307
Mamo-chan!

38
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:27,469
Hey! What are you
doing all of a sudden?

39
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:31,975
Mamo-chan, I've been looking
around for you for a long time!

40
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,880
Oh... Why is that?

41
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,350
"Why?" he asks.

42
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:39,116
Mamo-chan is pretending
he's clueless...

43
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:41,350
I guess what people
really need after all...

44
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:43,382
...are lovers and
not close friends.

45
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:48,658
Mamo-chan, I want
something as my gift.

46
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:55,064
If I'm getting something from
a prince, I want glass slippers.

47
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:59,369
They're at the glass sculpture shop
on the corner of the third block.

48
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,309
Please, buy them,
buy them, buy them for me!

49
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:03,346
We can go
together right now!

50
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,245
I see... It must be those
glass slippers after all.

51
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:12,518
Come on, Christmas is
still a while off.

52
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:14,216
Of course it is!

53
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,885
Mamo-chan, don't you know
what day it is today?!

54
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,395
Today? What's today?

55
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:22,895
You're kidding!

56
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:26,098
I'm kidding... I'm just joking.

57
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:28,900
I wouldn't forget an
important day like this.

58
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:32,041
Of course you
wouldn't, Mamo-chan!

59
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:36,571
Right... I know! It's the
day we first met, right, Usako?

60
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,181
It isn't, you blockhead!

61
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:49,421
W-What's up with that?

62
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,803
What's wrong, buns?

63
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,037
Tears don't look
good on you. Here...

64
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:10,642
Thank you.

65
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:22,889
I see, so that's
what happened.

66
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:25,520
Mamoru forgot
his girlfriend's birthday...

67
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:28,224
He has some nerve.

68
00:05:28,264 --> 00:05:31,358
He's not my boyfriend
or anything anymore!

69
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:34,632
Oh, then does that mean
I have a chance now?

70
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,335
There you go again, Haruka.

71
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,107
I'm not kidding...

72
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:44,306
I am rather fond
of you, buns-head.

73
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:47,343
Well, um, er...

74
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:49,574
Oh, that's right!

75
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:52,144
I have to go
to Rei's place!

76
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:53,120
Bye!

77
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:58,853
She really is cute.

78
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:02,823
But a girl like that might
be the owner of a talisman.

79
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05,328
I-Impossible...

80
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:15,234
Yes, Hino residence.

81
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:17,303
Oh, Mamoru?

82
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:19,281
Usagi isn't here yet.

83
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,943
I see... I don't
really know why...

84
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:24,249
...but I seem to
have upset Usako.

85
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,847
I see.
That's what's going on...

86
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:30,956
Sheesh. You were
always like this, Mamoru!

87
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:33,554
You don't understand
how a woman feels!

88
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,061
W-What do you mean by that?

89
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,965
Today is Usagi's
birthday, you know.

90
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:43,565
I see now. So that's
why Usako was so upset.

91
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:59,379
Maybe I did do something
bad to Mamo-chan...

92
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,992
Sorry. Did I keep you all waiting?

93
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:17,998
Happy Birthday!

94
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:23,544
Now, now, the main guest
should sit down. Sit.

95
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,448
Eat up! I made these
the best I could!

96
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:31,053
Here you go, Usagi.
A gift from us.

97
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:33,487
A set of problems
often seen on exams.

98
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,015
T-Thanks...

99
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:40,426
What's this? We held a
surprise party for you...

100
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:43,296
...so can't you be at least
a little bit livelier?

101
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:45,891
Y-Yeah, you're right.

102
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:50,031
Today we can forget about
studying and really party!

103
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:52,803
Yeah, yeah! Let's go
all-out and party!

104
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:54,707
It's just for today, guys.

105
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:57,575
Ami, you're so...!

106
00:07:57,614 --> 00:08:01,015
Now, now...
Let's have a drink first.

107
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:06,484
I really did want a
gift from Mamo-chan, too...

108
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:10,825
Let's see,
the third block...

109
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:34,246
This should do it...

110
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:37,251
Welcome!

111
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:40,779
Excuse me. Can I have
these glass slippers?

112
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:42,848
Sure, right away...

113
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:47,727
That's...?!

114
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm sure that was Kaorinite.

115
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,530
Yeah... The target this
time might be that guy.

116
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:07,508
Congrats, Usagi!

117
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:11,651
What's wrong?
You don't look very cheerful...

118
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:16,283
Y-Yeah... I slapped
Mamo-chan across the cheek.

119
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:22,688
It was sorta spontaneous, but
I just couldn't forgive him...

120
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:27,192
You're saying Mamoru forgot that
today was your birthday, right?

121
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:31,503
But, Usagi, Mamoru didn't
forget. He never knew.

122
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:36,773
Usagi, did you ever tell
Mamoru when your birthday was?

123
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,278
Come to think of it,
I never told him!

124
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:44,284
B-But, but, if you
really love each other...

125
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,254
...you'd realize
things like that!

126
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,853
Then, do you know
Mamoru's birthday, Usagi?

127
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:54,488
Of course I do!
Let's see...

128
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,297
October 10 is Sports Day
and December 25 is Christmas...

129
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:03,138
I don't know! Sorry!

130
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:07,340
I'm going to go
apologize to Mamo-chan.

131
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:20,948
Mamo-chan!

132
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:22,685
Usako!

133
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:27,521
I'm sorry, Mamo-chan!

134
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:30,054
I have been looking
for you, Princess...

135
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,001
Now, let's check to see
if it's the correct size...

136
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:37,801
M-Mamo-chan...

137
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:40,171
Thank you.

138
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:48,282
What is it?!

139
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,660
SENISHENTA!

140
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:37,057
I will take your pure heart
that cares about that guy-SHENTA!

141
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,960
W-What does this all mean?!

142
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:45,397
Usako!

143
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:47,466
Get out of the way-SHENTA!

144
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:49,610
Mamo-chan!

145
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:53,578
N-No!

146
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:55,846
No, no, no, no, no, NO!

147
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:58,115
Come on, behave-SHENTA...

148
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:00,417
In this case...

149
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,789
MOON COSMIC POWER...MAKE--

150
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:10,563
You tried to punch
me with THAT?!

151
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,592
You are a tremendously
dangerous person-SHENTA!

152
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:15,398
My transformation brooch...!

153
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:25,108
What is this...?!

154
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:27,946
Now you can't
fight back-SHENTA!

155
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:33,946
Buns-head...

156
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,117
...was the target this time?

157
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,232
Don't worry-SHENTA!

158
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:47,862
All I'll do is take out
your pure heart-SHENTA!

159
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:52,998
NO!

160
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:02,718
Uranus, shouldn't we help her?

161
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:07,921
Well... She might be the
owner of the talisman.

162
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:09,391
Oh?

163
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,359
It's written all
over your face.

164
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:13,521
What should you do if
that really is the case?

165
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:15,292
Don't be ridiculous!

166
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,831
Neptune!

167
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:24,105
Oh, this must be the light
of a talisman-SHENTA!

168
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:27,005
You're kidding...

169
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,504
It is different from all
the previous glimmers.

170
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:32,207
What are you
going to do?

171
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:34,216
If it is a talisman,
we'll take it, of course!

172
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,410
Wait!

173
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:38,110
That's not what I mean!

174
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:42,883
If that really is a talisman...

175
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,359
...then you won't
return it to her, right?

176
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:47,261
Y-Yeah...

177
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:49,992
Then that also means
that girl's death.

178
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:13,381
What's...?

179
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:18,817
Who is it-SHENTA?!

180
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:21,763
A pure heart
is a ray of light...

181
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,492
...that brightens the
darkness of the night.

182
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:27,128
I will make sure to protect
the glimmer of the pure heart!!

183
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:30,339
Take this!

184
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:36,102
Speak to me!

185
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:39,440
Let's go!

186
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,113
Dammit, where are
you going-SHENTA?

187
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:47,149
Usako... You should transform
into Sailor Moon as well.

188
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:49,117
Uh, about that...

189
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,990
Senishenta...
What happened to that girl?

190
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,965
Actually, we've had
an unexpected disturbance.

191
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,263
You idiot!
Look for her immediately!

192
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:02,066
Yes, I will look for
her immediately-SHENTA!

193
00:15:06,142 --> 00:15:07,575
This is...

194
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:13,142
Can that girl be...?!

195
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:15,047
Uh-oh, this is bad...

196
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:17,848
We can't do anything about it.
We should retreat for now.

197
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:20,014
But, my transformation brooch...!

198
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:22,547
Now isn't the time to
be saying such things.

199
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:24,992
The person that
they're after is YOU.

200
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:26,756
O-Okay...

201
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:29,631
I'm sorry, Usako...

202
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:33,726
It's all my fault that you're
in this dangerous situation.

203
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:35,794
T-That's not true...

204
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:38,739
Come on, Tuxedo Mask, let's hurry!

205
00:15:38,774 --> 00:15:39,832
Yeah...

206
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,705
There they are-SHENTA!

207
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:43,938
You found them?!

208
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,038
Yes!

209
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:45,809
Follow them!

210
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,213
Yes!!

211
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:51,013
Looks like
they've found us...

212
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:02,762
Tuxedo Mask, please
leave me here and run!

213
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:04,993
I'm sure that
I got in your way...

214
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:06,626
...and let them find us!

215
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,933
- That's not true!
- B-But...

216
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:35,354
You should give up.

217
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:37,832
I won't let you
run away anywhere.

218
00:16:42,872 --> 00:16:44,897
I know! Luna!
Help me, Luna!

219
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:57,743
It's no use trying to call
your friends here, Sailor Moon.

220
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:06,818
Are you sure about this, Uranus?

221
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:09,055
Yeah. It's okay...

222
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:13,093
Our mission is to collect
the three talismans...

223
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:15,035
...and get a hold
of the Holy Grail.

224
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:18,768
For that purpose, a little
sacrifice is unavoidable.

225
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:21,737
Uranus...

226
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:26,475
Should we really have
eaten all of Usagi's cake?

227
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:28,978
It's all right! It is!

228
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:31,713
I'm sure she made up
with Mamoru by now.

229
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:35,553
I'm jealous.

230
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:37,354
Me, too.

231
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:40,328
I can't quite solve
this equation...

232
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:44,999
Everyone, we have a problem!

233
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:47,395
What's the trouble, Luna?

234
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:49,404
Something must have
happened to Usagi!

235
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:50,530
Everyone, it's time to act!

236
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:53,041
- All right! Let's go, everyone!
- Right!

237
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:00,648
Stand back, Usako.

238
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:02,651
Tuxedo Mask...

239
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:05,886
When they drop their guard,
run away. Got that?

240
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:07,920
Now, I challenge you!

241
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:09,683
How stupid...

242
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:12,193
Senishenta, take care of him.

243
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:22,360
You're pretty tough-SHENTA...

244
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:41,683
Usako, now!

245
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:43,621
I couldn't do such a thing...

246
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:45,592
- Hurry up!
- R-Right...

247
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,695
I said you won't
be able to escape.

248
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:55,597
Usako!

249
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:57,401
Where are you looking-SHENTA?!

250
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,703
Your opponent is ME-SHENTA!

251
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:07,441
Don't you want
to get this back?

252
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,449
T-That's...!

253
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:16,019
You don't need it?

254
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:19,050
If you don't need it,
I guess I'll destroy it.

255
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,740
Now be obedient and let
your pure heart be taken!

256
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:36,768
Otherwise...

257
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:41,349
Stop it!

258
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:47,983
Usako!!!

259
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:49,422
Fool!

260
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:01,158
Impossible...!

261
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:04,906
U-Usako...

262
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:08,342
Mamo-chan!

263
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:15,342
