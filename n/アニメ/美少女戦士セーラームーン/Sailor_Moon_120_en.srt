1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,468
Hotaru is missing...

2
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:06,937
Nobody is at her house, either...

3
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:10,373
Haruka's group said that she
was the warrior of destruction...

4
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:13,867
...but I won't let them kill her!

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,643
I, Sailor Moon, WILL save her!

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,968
You don't know the horror of silence!

7
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:41,604
Unless we kill that girl,
Sailor Saturn will awaken.

8
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,347
If Saturn awakens,
it means the end of this planet.

9
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:04,060
Chibiusa...

10
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:18,583
Small Lady...

11
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:21,217
Plu...

12
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:24,087
Where... Where did you take Hotaru!?

13
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:29,823
When I got here,
everyone had already disappeared...

14
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:32,353
That's a lie!
Hotaru is my friend!

15
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:35,128
She wouldn't disappear
without telling me!

16
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:36,032
Plu...

17
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,195
It's your fault, Plu!

18
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:40,296
She disappeared because
you guys said mean things, Plu!

19
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,568
Hotaru...

20
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:43,131
Hotaru is my...

21
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:45,144
F-Friend...!!

22
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:48,170
Small Lady...

23
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:50,512
Plu...

24
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,745
I hate you, Plu...!

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,154
Small Lady...

26
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:00,758
Nobody was in Hotaru's house.

27
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:05,093
Neither Professor Tomoe,
her father... or his assistant, Kaori...

28
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:07,759
And they didn't leave even one clue...

29
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:11,164
What can you find out using
the computer, Mamo-chan?

30
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:15,265
Information about Professor Tomoe should
be registered in the academic files...

31
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:17,435
Perhaps there's a clue there...

32
00:02:17,477 --> 00:02:18,409
Here it is!

33
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:22,540
Soichi Tomoe, the pioneer
man in genetic engineering...

34
00:02:22,582 --> 00:02:24,277
Professor at Mugen Academy...?

35
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:25,915
Mugen Academy...?

36
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:27,920
That's where Haruka and
company attend, right?

37
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:29,114
Hotaru, too.

38
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:33,752
That's the elite school with strict
standards, full of geniuses, right?

39
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:34,760
Yes.

40
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:37,490
An education from elementary school
all the way up to its university.

41
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,555
I hear that the high-rise
building which serves as...

42
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,624
...their campus is filled
with state-of-the-art equipment.

43
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,662
What's wrong?

44
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:48,401
Not only is Soichi Tomoe
a professor at Mugen Academy...

45
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:50,306
...but he's also the owner.

46
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:54,638
Owner... you mean it's his school?

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,045
What does that mean?

48
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:59,381
Perhaps there is a clue at that school...

49
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,819
It looks like we need to investigate...

50
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:03,347
Setsuna!

51
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,754
Chibiusa!

52
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,019
What's wrong?

53
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:08,322
You shouldn't walk around so late at night...

54
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:09,555
Wait...

55
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:12,029
Chibiusa, you're soaked!

56
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:13,588
What are you doing?

57
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:15,658
You didn't take an umbrella with you?

58
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:19,660
Sheesh, you're so soaked...
You'll catch a cold.

59
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:21,172
Now, come over here...

60
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:22,871
Usako.

61
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,604
Mamo-chan...

62
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:28,113
Thanks for walking her back here.

63
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:29,876
Then, I will be on my way.

64
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,178
No, wait.

65
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:34,582
We would like to ask a little
about Mugen Academy.

66
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,178
Do you mind?

67
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:45,696
Mugen Academy is a school that
Soichi Tomoe created three years ago.

68
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:49,724
However, many strange incidents
have happened on campus.

69
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,603
So Uranus and Neptune, who'd been thinking
the school was suspicious for a while...

70
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,368
...entered Mugen Academy
as students to investigate.

71
00:03:55,408 --> 00:03:56,773
Undercover operation...

72
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:58,208
Then, Professor Tomoe is...

73
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:03,206
We feel that he has something
to do with the Death Busters...

74
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:06,482
But then, Hotaru...

75
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,680
...is part of the Death Busters, too?

76
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:10,450
We don't know...

77
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,723
All we know is that Hotaru Tomoe is
the reincarnation of Sailor Saturn.

78
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:18,220
That's right...

79
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:21,528
There's no way that
Hotaru can be our enemy!

80
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,795
Chibiusa...

81
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:25,736
Hotaru is a really good, kind girl!

82
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:26,835
You can't...

83
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:28,773
You can't kill her!

84
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:31,902
You just can't do something like that!

85
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:33,241
Setsuna...

86
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:36,504
Even if Saturn was
the soldier of destruction...

87
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:38,244
...she's still a Sailor
Soldier like us, right?

88
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:43,053
Isn't there another way around this?

89
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:52,263
This is why we didn't want to
involve all of you in this battle...

90
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:03,573
It's me...

91
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:05,770
Professor, it's Mimet.

92
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:08,279
I found the next target!

93
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:12,284
The authority on the physics of
alternate dimensions, Dr. Sergai Ajimov!

94
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:16,283
He's holding a special lecture
at Mugen Academy today.

95
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:20,416
The theory of an alternate universe...
A very curious hypothesis.

96
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:21,448
Then...!

97
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:25,294
No, unfortunately, there is no
need for you to head out for now.

98
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:28,793
But he's very cool and handsome...

99
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:32,797
Well, I'll be contacting you soon, Mimet.

100
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:37,436
I understand... I will be waiting.

101
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:50,816
It's time to go, Telulu.

102
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,923
Oh, my!

103
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,019
She is doing her best...

104
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:58,326
But, I'm not getting
the results I really want...

105
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:03,092
So I decided that I should
put my hopes upon you.

106
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:07,834
If you succeed, you will become
the next executive! Do your best!

107
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:09,340
Yes, Professor!

108
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:11,633
Then, I'll be going now...

109
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:15,939
You've got to be kidding!

110
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:17,847
This has to be a joke!

111
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:25,517
Yes, Telulu here.

112
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,822
I'm sorry to bother you again, Telulu...

113
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,193
But that operation has been canceled.

114
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,857
I will call you again.

115
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:36,356
Just you sit there and wait!

116
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:39,864
"Just you"...?

117
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:45,274
I am the next executive
of the Death Busters!!

118
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:46,141
Fine!

119
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:50,877
I'll just have to get rid of the Sailor Soldiers
myself and show them what power I have!

120
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,382
Oh, Chief Eugeal!

121
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:58,956
I'll borrow that machine you
were making for a little bit!

122
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:14,099
This is creepy...

123
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,506
I do feel something ominous here.

124
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:17,702
Mugen Academy...

125
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:19,108
It really is suspicious.

126
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:23,138
It seems like this school is holding a
special lecture with a guest speaker today.

127
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:25,650
It says that anyone can
enter the school today.

128
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:27,346
It's our chance! Let's go!

129
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,353
Yeah!

130
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:36,962
An article from 4 years ago...?

131
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:39,829
A huge fire at a genetic engineering lab...

132
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:42,663
All the research staffers died...

133
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:46,103
Professor Tomoe and his eldest
daughter's miraculous survival...

134
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:50,566
They were able to escape from a building
lost in a huge fire without a scratch...?

135
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:51,940
Just the two of them?

136
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:53,968
What does this mean?

137
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,685
Hotaru is a kind girl!

138
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:05,486
You can't just kill her like that!

139
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:14,288
Nobody's here.

140
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,824
Everyone must be at the lecture hall.

141
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:17,665
What should we do?

142
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:20,331
For now, let's look for the computer room.

143
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:22,499
We might be able to find
something out if we look there.

144
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:27,437
What is it, Mako-chan?

145
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:32,684
I said, what is it?

146
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:36,746
- Hey, Mako-chan, stop it.
- No, it's not me, it isn't!

147
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,381
I said, stop it!

148
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:40,016
Hey! Can't you stay quiet... huh?

149
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,525
What are you doing here?!

150
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:51,528
Um, we were wondering where the lecture
hall was... We're kinda lost... yeah...

151
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:55,438
The lecture hall is that way.
Turn right when you get to the wall.

152
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:58,034
- Oh, yeah, I see.
- Thanks a lot.

153
00:08:58,444 --> 00:08:59,536
Wait.

154
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:03,272
You forgot something.

155
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,380
I-I'm a little weak in the knees...

156
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:10,950
What are you doing?
You're so embarrassing!

157
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,720
I'm so sorry...

158
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:18,995
H-Hey, you, hold it right there!

159
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:23,233
I'm not suspicious or anything!

160
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:25,229
You're TOO suspicious!

161
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:28,299
Let me take a look
at what you got there!

162
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,240
W-Wait a minute!

163
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,709
No!

164
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:32,301
Show it!

165
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:35,142
No, no, stop it!

166
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,213
I don't have anything to lose anymore...

167
00:09:40,252 --> 00:09:42,243
Will you stay out of my way?

168
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:13,242
An alternate universe.
It's not a faraway existence.

169
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:16,644
The possibility that an alternate
dimension and our own universe...

170
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:21,251
...are ALWAYS working in parallel
to one another is very large!

171
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:24,758
For instance, take a small nebula like this.

172
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:27,197
Perhaps it's that nebulas such as this...

173
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:31,761
...are just invisible to us,
and may as well exist right next to us.

174
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:36,565
And there is the further possibility
that there are life-forms inside.

175
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:38,770
We are unable to see them.

176
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:44,446
But, at the same time, I believe that
the rare unable to see us, either.

177
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:52,948
Likewise, there's a possibility that outside our
universe, there lies an even bigger universe.

178
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:55,123
We are unable to see it for now.

179
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,024
But...

180
00:10:56,061 --> 00:11:02,660
...if the conditions are right, we will be able
to find such a universe... and observe it.

181
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,936
I'm glad that the school
staff are all so academic.

182
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:18,177
We can even come inside
off-limits places like this as a result.

183
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:23,547
But the entrance to the central
headquarters of the Death Busters...

184
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:28,056
...is not that easy to find, huh...?

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,433
Don't surprise us...

186
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:39,835
The girls are also investigating
this Mugen Academy.

187
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:41,834
I see...

188
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:44,367
This is only my hypothesis, but...

189
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:50,349
...perhaps it's true that the alternate
universe in itself maybe one giant life-form.

190
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:06,491
The time for our beautiful space to swallow the
Milky Way galaxy in its entirety is approaching.

191
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,266
Papa!

192
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:23,778
Now, Hotaru, it's dangerous if
you poke your head out like that.

193
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:25,711
Look.

194
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:30,779
This is a special space that I prepared
for delicate gene splicing experiments.

195
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,798
Papa... What's that?

196
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:54,378
Hotaru! Hang in there, Hotaru!

197
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:55,573
Hotaru...

198
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:57,309
Oh, what a horrible thing!

199
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:58,782
Hotaru...

200
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:06,784
Do you want to save
The life of that girl?

201
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,284
What...!?

202
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:15,934
I will save the lives of you and that girl.
But I have one condition.

203
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:20,434
P-Please, save us!

204
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:22,872
I don't care what happens
to me, but Hotaru...!!

205
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:27,345
I see...
Then, I'll take over your bodies.

206
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:44,662
Now, awaken.

207
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:47,722
For our true purpose!!

208
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:55,470
Now...

209
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:59,568
Next, I'll start explaining the equations for the
structure of the alternate dimensional universe.

210
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:08,578
Everyone, although we are in the middle of
the lecture, Dr. Ajimov will be leaving now.

211
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,417
Please pardon the inconvenience!

212
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:18,459
It's so nice to be the center of attention...

213
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:21,694
I won't let Telulu take this joy away from me!

214
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:28,598
CHARM...

215
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,131
...BUSTER!

216
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:39,715
Appear, Daimohn!

217
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,714
Upasocon!

218
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:46,719
Oh, an appearance that truly experiments
with the alternate dimension theory!

219
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:56,262
Now, do it all in one shot, Upasocon!

220
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:57,097
Roger!

221
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:03,307
Preparations complete!

222
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:04,240
Suction!

223
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:16,514
Mimet!

224
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:20,582
Trying to steal the heart of a professor,
the treasure of humankind!

225
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:22,389
We won't forgive people like that!

226
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:24,361
Heaven knows, the earth knows,
and people know.

227
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:26,387
For love and justice,
the Sailor Team!

228
00:15:26,431 --> 00:15:28,160
In the name of the moon,
we'll punish you!

229
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:33,301
All you do is talk nonsense!

230
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:35,033
Upasocon, get them!

231
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:35,664
Roger!

232
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,672
Prepare for attack.

233
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:40,108
Mount!

234
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:42,936
Confirm targets.

235
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:44,915
First attack!

236
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:51,584
BURNING...

237
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:53,090
...MANDALA!!

238
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,950
SPARKLING WIDE...

239
00:15:57,863 --> 00:15:59,490
...PRESSURE!

240
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:00,793
You did it!

241
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:01,560
Not yet!

242
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,933
They're still hiding
somewhere around there!

243
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,805
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

244
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:15,542
Being off guard is bad for you!

245
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:16,980
Jupiter! Mars!

246
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:19,381
I'm over here, too, you know!

247
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:21,682
CHARM...

248
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,154
...BUSTER!

249
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:29,891
Mercury! Venus!

250
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:31,657
Counterattack!

251
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:35,595
Jupiter! Mars!

252
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:40,001
Well done, Upasocon.

253
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:41,801
An honor greater than imagined!

254
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,436
If I bring back a pure heart,
and also defeat these little brats...

255
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:49,413
I will make it back in the group!
A comeback!

256
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:52,608
Now, Upasocon, finish them off!.

257
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:53,345
Roger!

258
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,875
PINK SUGAR...

259
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,048
...HEART ATTACK!

260
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,991
Sailor Moon! Now!

261
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:04,292
Right!

262
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:08,290
CRISIS...

263
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,733
MAKE UP!

264
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:41,696
RAINBOW...

265
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,098
...MOON...

266
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:46,104
...HEART ACHE!

267
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:53,910
Careless!

268
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:03,246
Love-Lovely!

269
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:10,093
Now, Mimet, give up!

270
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:15,728
What are you talking about?

271
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:18,099
Do you have that much strength left?

272
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:21,972
I still have the ultimate weapon!

273
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:23,738
What!?

274
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,968
WITCHES...

275
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:27,911
...ELECTRIC...

276
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:30,346
...WARP!

277
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,743
She disappeared?

278
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:37,584
What's going on?

279
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,581
W-Where is she?

280
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:44,721
Now, Mimet will be
perform in gonstage!

281
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,802
Were you surprised?

282
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:03,281
But it's not just my
body that grew bigger.

283
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:07,877
This machine makes my powers
tens of times as strong as well!

284
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,511
It feels so good...

285
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:14,218
To see me on stage like this,
you guys are really lucky!

286
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,558
Now, let's go!

287
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:20,193
Wonderful, Mimet...
You really are wonderful.

288
00:19:20,232 --> 00:19:22,996
T-That voice...!! Telulu!

289
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:27,729
But it's not good to take someone
else's work away, you know...

290
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:30,606
S-Shut up!
Don't get in my wary!

291
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:35,079
Do you know why our old chief
Eugeal didn't use that machine...?

292
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:36,878
T-That's...!!

293
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:39,110
Yup. One thing about that machine...

294
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:44,589
When you turn off the power while you're in
the monitor, you're trapped in there forever.

295
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:46,288
S-Stop!

296
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:47,757
Please, stop!

297
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:49,124
Come on, I'll apologize!

298
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:51,186
Any thing but that!

299
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:54,687
Just don't pull that plug!

300
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,394
Farewell, idiot.

301
00:19:57,102 --> 00:20:00,162
NOOOOO!!!

302
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,109
F-Fighting amongst themselves...?

303
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:13,140
What in the world is going on?

304
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:14,550
Super Sailor Moon!?

305
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:15,382
Are you all right!

306
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,751
Hang in there!

307
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:17,948
I'm all right...

308
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:20,184
I'm just a little tired...

309
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:27,184
