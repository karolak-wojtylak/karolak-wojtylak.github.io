WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.298
What is a pure heart?

00:04.335 --> 00:06.428
A pure heart that loves someone.

00:06.471 --> 00:09.634
Our pure hearts of
friendship and kindness.

00:09.674 --> 00:12.575
I want to treasure
such pure hearts.

00:12.610 --> 00:16.376
Chibiusa, even if you return
to the future, don't ever forget...

00:16.414 --> 00:20.282
That our hearts are
always together as one!

00:25.000 --> 00:26.865
What a beautiful moon.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.733
Yeah.

00:32.174 --> 00:33.163
It's quiet.

00:33.209 --> 00:36.406
Yeah... Peaceful nights are so nice.

00:36.445 --> 00:37.912
Mamo-chan...

00:39.215 --> 00:41.513
You know... um...

00:41.550 --> 00:43.780
Isn't it a little cold?

00:43.819 --> 00:46.481
I guess it is...

00:48.424 --> 00:51.552
I want you to warm me up...

00:52.628 --> 00:54.755
Mamo-chan...

00:55.998 --> 00:58.330
Mamo-chan?

00:59.001 --> 01:00.332
What are you doing?

01:00.369 --> 01:02.234
What? Well, you're cold, right?

01:02.271 --> 01:06.037
How about we go inside
and have some warm cocoa...

01:06.075 --> 01:08.168
What's wrong?
Why are you pouting?

01:08.210 --> 01:11.373
Sheesh! Mamo-chan,
you're so dense!

01:24.760 --> 01:27.126
A beautiful starry sky...

01:37.072 --> 01:38.198
A letter?

01:38.741 --> 01:40.265
It's from Mama.

01:40.309 --> 01:41.435
"To Small Lady.

01:41.477 --> 01:42.842
How are you doing?

01:42.878 --> 01:44.607
I'm lonely because I can't see you.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.137
It's about time you came home.

01:46.182 --> 01:47.114
-- From Mama.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.946
PS. Papa is waiting, too."

01:50.920 --> 01:53.081
Mama...

01:55.691 --> 01:58.216
Small Lady.

01:58.561 --> 02:00.961
Small Lady.

02:01.564 --> 02:04.328
Papa... Mama...

02:06.869 --> 02:07.961
I'm home!

02:11.140 --> 02:12.072
Usagi...

02:12.107 --> 02:14.473
What's wrong?
What are you holding?

02:18.047 --> 02:19.139
This...

02:19.181 --> 02:21.877
Oh, let me see...

02:25.054 --> 02:27.022
Chibiusa ... This...?

02:27.056 --> 02:27.852
Yeah...

02:28.824 --> 02:30.849
A letter from the future?

02:31.126 --> 02:33.788
Yeah... she said it was
a letter from her mom...

02:33.829 --> 02:36.354
Of course, that would be me...

02:36.899 --> 02:40.130
And... was it all in hiragana?

02:41.537 --> 02:43.004
Minako!!

02:43.038 --> 02:46.030
It's not the time for that, is it!?

02:46.075 --> 02:48.270
- Sorry!
- So, what was written on it?

02:48.377 --> 02:51.278
Well... for her to come back now...

02:51.947 --> 02:54.279
And, what did Chibiusa say?

02:54.516 --> 02:56.279
Well...

02:56.318 --> 02:58.980
It doesn't have to be right now...

02:59.021 --> 03:01.751
If I wanted to go home,
I can go back when ever I want...

03:04.026 --> 03:06.722
She's at that age where she wants
to be spoiled by her parents...

03:06.762 --> 03:08.559
I think she does want
to see them after all...

03:08.597 --> 03:10.565
I think so, too.

03:10.599 --> 03:13.762
Maybe she just can't honestly
say that she wants to go back...

03:13.802 --> 03:16.566
Chibiusa is the type who doesn't
want to show her weakness to others...

03:17.706 --> 03:20.539
Now that the trouble
has settled down...

03:20.576 --> 03:24.512
I would like to send Chibiusa
back to her parents' place.

03:24.546 --> 03:27.572
Let's give her some
good memories of us!

03:27.616 --> 03:29.846
Is there a good way?

03:30.552 --> 03:32.850
How about a farewell party?

03:33.022 --> 03:35.718
Oh, you say something
good once in a while.

03:35.758 --> 03:37.282
That's a good idea.

03:37.326 --> 03:39.226
Let's start getting ready for it!

03:39.261 --> 03:41.855
Then, I'll make a feast!

03:42.264 --> 03:44.027
Hey, and where are
we going to have it?

03:44.066 --> 03:47.126
How about Mamoru's condo?
Usagi, can you ask?

03:47.169 --> 03:47.863
Yeah...

03:49.204 --> 03:51.365
A farewell party?

03:51.774 --> 03:55.870
That's right. We decided to have it
at Mamo-chan's place tomorrow.

03:56.178 --> 03:59.306
That can't be... I haven't decided
on going back immediately yet...

03:59.348 --> 04:01.873
We all talked it out and decided.

04:01.917 --> 04:03.851
You don't need to hold back.

04:03.886 --> 04:07.117
Let's have a huge party
and have a rowdy time!

04:07.723 --> 04:11.124
You want me to go back that badly?

04:13.762 --> 04:15.696
Nothing!

04:16.332 --> 04:17.629
Chibiusa!?

04:18.033 --> 04:19.000
How strange...

04:19.034 --> 04:22.299
It doesn't look like she's
too happy about it.

04:22.338 --> 04:24.135
Yeah...

04:25.040 --> 04:26.769
Usagi, you idiot!

04:26.809 --> 04:29.403
If I go back to the future,
it means that...

04:29.445 --> 04:34.280
...I won't be able to see you,
Mamo-chan, or everyone else!

04:35.484 --> 04:37.281
To not be able to see everyone...

04:41.623 --> 04:43.557
I don't want that...

04:49.631 --> 04:51.690
I don't want that at all.

04:51.734 --> 04:53.565
I don't!!

04:54.536 --> 04:56.163
You know, Usagi...

04:56.205 --> 05:02.075
You mentioned a gift for Chibiusa, but didn't
you spend all of your allowance already?

05:02.277 --> 05:03.437
It's all right.

05:03.479 --> 05:06.175
It's a gift for Chibiusa who's
going back to the future!

05:06.215 --> 05:10.117
It has to be a wonderful gift
that money can't buy!

05:10.152 --> 05:11.312
Here it is!

05:12.287 --> 05:16.986
This is the one-piece dress that
I really liked when I was little!

05:22.531 --> 05:23.589
Chibiusa?

05:23.632 --> 05:24.599
Mamo-chan...

05:26.235 --> 05:27.600
What's wrong?

05:31.273 --> 05:33.605
I can't understand if you stay quiet.

05:33.642 --> 05:35.371
Anyway, come on in.

05:35.411 --> 05:36.605
Y-Yeah...

05:45.554 --> 05:49.115
Mamo-chan, does everyone hate me?

05:49.892 --> 05:51.723
Why do you think that?

05:51.760 --> 05:55.526
This farewell party is so sudden...

05:55.564 --> 05:58.124
It sounds like they want
me to go back so soon.

05:59.735 --> 06:04.138
Everyone is thinking about how
nice it would be if you could stay...

06:04.773 --> 06:07.742
But you're still a child, Chibiusa.

06:07.776 --> 06:10.609
It's best for you to
live with your parents.

06:10.646 --> 06:14.776
Don't you want to see your
parents as well, Chibiusa?

06:15.617 --> 06:19.383
It's tough for Usako and the others
to be parting with you, too, Chibiusa.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.816
Mamo-chan...

06:26.261 --> 06:30.857
Are you going to be
sad, too, Mamo-chan?

06:31.333 --> 06:33.858
Of course I will, too.

06:34.803 --> 06:36.771
Mamo-chan!

06:36.805 --> 06:39.205
Mamo-chan!

06:48.350 --> 06:50.545
Ouch!

06:54.356 --> 06:56.153
Usagi?

06:56.191 --> 06:57.624
What are you doing?

06:57.993 --> 07:00.120
N-Nothing.

07:00.162 --> 07:02.323
Kids should go to sleep early!

07:02.364 --> 07:04.594
But...

07:05.033 --> 07:05.965
Good night.

07:07.736 --> 07:10.728
I'm sorry, Chibiusa...

07:11.607 --> 07:13.734
Usagi, you're an idiot!

07:13.775 --> 07:17.802
You don't understand
my feelings at ALL!

08:04.259 --> 08:07.126
To Chibiusa's future!

08:07.496 --> 08:09.623
Now, eat up!

08:09.965 --> 08:11.933
Chibiusa, cheer up.

08:11.967 --> 08:16.404
The future is just a little further than
Hokkaido, and it's closer than heaven.

08:16.438 --> 08:19.134
You can come back
again anytime you want!

08:19.174 --> 08:22.473
Usagi, have you
ever gone to heaven?

08:22.511 --> 08:23.739
No...

08:23.779 --> 08:26.009
Why do you need to correct her?

08:26.048 --> 08:29.643
Well, let's have a blast!
First, I'll sing a song!

08:29.818 --> 08:31.649
Yeah! I've been waiting for that!

08:50.439 --> 08:53.636
Rangy!

08:55.410 --> 08:57.970
Pure hearts...

09:00.449 --> 09:03.646
I must collect pure hearts...

09:27.876 --> 09:31.539
Now, Chibiusa, we have
presents foryou.

09:31.580 --> 09:33.639
You go first, Mako-chan.

09:34.149 --> 09:38.085
Here, Chibiusa.
I packed you a lunch!

09:38.120 --> 09:41.180
Heat it up in the microwave
and eat it with your parents!

09:41.223 --> 09:42.781
Thanks, Mako-chan.

09:42.824 --> 09:45.088
I programmed this.

09:45.127 --> 09:48.619
Sheesh, Ami, academics
even for a time like this?

09:48.664 --> 09:51.633
Studying when you are
young is very important...

09:51.667 --> 09:55.103
Study hard, and when
you're tired, play with this.

09:55.137 --> 09:58.038
It's an original game I made,
and everyone's in it.

09:58.507 --> 10:00.031
Thanks, Ami.

10:00.709 --> 10:05.373
The gift from me is a cassette
with my singing in it!

10:05.414 --> 10:08.645
I made the last song
Just for you, Chibiusa.

10:08.684 --> 10:10.117
Take time to listen to it.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.380
Thanks, Rei.

10:11.420 --> 10:15.652
I compiled all the photos we
took together in an album.

10:16.525 --> 10:19.358
See? They're all our fun memories.

10:19.394 --> 10:20.361
Here, can you hold all of it?

10:20.395 --> 10:22.363
Yeah. Thanks, Minako.

10:22.397 --> 10:24.763
Chibiusa.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.060
Mamo-chan.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.830
A red rosebud means
"purity" and "cuteness."

10:33.208 --> 10:35.403
It fits you perfectly, Chibiusa.

10:35.444 --> 10:36.843
Mamo-chan...

10:38.046 --> 10:41.573
Will everyone's gifts fit in this...?

10:42.984 --> 10:44.713
Usagi... this is...?

10:44.753 --> 10:47.813
Well... it doesn't look all that great, but...

10:47.856 --> 10:50.586
Wow, a cute backpack of a puppy!!

10:50.625 --> 10:51.785
It's well-made!

10:51.827 --> 10:54.762
Rei! This isn't a puppy!
It's a rabbit!!

10:55.030 --> 10:58.761
Oh... I-I'm sorry, it is a rabbit now
that I looked at it more closely.

10:59.067 --> 11:02.332
Rei, you always make
fun of me like that!

11:02.371 --> 11:03.998
Do you have some grudge
against me or something!?

11:04.039 --> 11:06.564
What!? You don't have to put it that way!

11:06.608 --> 11:08.769
I just said a dog because
it looked like a dog!

11:08.810 --> 11:11.404
You don't have to keep
saying "dog" like that!

11:11.446 --> 11:14.677
You're so annoying!
Don't bark at me like some stray dog!

11:14.716 --> 11:17.082
There, you said "dog" again!

11:17.119 --> 11:19.644
Sheesh, you overexerted
yourself knowing you're clumsy!

11:19.688 --> 11:21.781
You've got scratches all over!
Here!

11:22.257 --> 11:24.282
At least put bandages on them.

11:25.594 --> 11:26.492
Thanks.

11:26.528 --> 11:28.462
Here, I'll put them on for you.

11:28.497 --> 11:31.295
I'll help you with those, Chibiusa.
Let me see...

11:31.700 --> 11:37.002
Chibiusa, Usagi seems to have made that to
the best of her ability, after many failures...

11:37.038 --> 11:38.630
I'm jealous...

11:38.673 --> 11:42.302
Rei and Usagi can say
anything they want to each other...

11:42.344 --> 11:44.778
They say that the more you argue,
the better friends you are...

11:44.813 --> 11:47.805
I wish I had a friend that
I could be like that with...

11:54.856 --> 11:56.756
Here is fine.

11:57.726 --> 11:59.125
It will only be tougher...

11:59.161 --> 12:01.823
Thanks, everyone.

12:04.699 --> 12:07.327
I troubled you for lots of things...

12:07.769 --> 12:10.329
Keep doing your best even
when you go back to the future.

12:10.372 --> 12:13.034
Listen to what your
parents have to say.

12:13.074 --> 12:15.702
Please give my regards
to everyone in the future.

12:15.744 --> 12:16.768
Take care.

12:16.812 --> 12:20.043
Do remember us every so often.

12:22.217 --> 12:23.912
Usagi.

12:27.689 --> 12:30.123
Chibiusa...

12:33.728 --> 12:36.219
Good-bye...

12:38.467 --> 12:39.900
Chibiusa!

12:39.935 --> 12:41.425
- Usagi!
- Wait!

12:42.270 --> 12:44.431
Can you leave them alone...?

12:57.085 --> 12:58.552
Oh, Guardian of Time...

12:58.587 --> 13:02.853
Doors of time, break open the skies,
and release them for me!

13:02.891 --> 13:06.258
I call out your true name,
oh almighty lord of time...

13:07.262 --> 13:09.696
Father of guardians, Chronos!

13:09.731 --> 13:11.631
Guide me!

13:11.666 --> 13:13.759
Protect me!

13:13.802 --> 13:16.828
Show me the path of light!

13:19.941 --> 13:21.067
Chibiusa!

13:22.077 --> 13:23.066
Usagi!!

13:28.517 --> 13:31.008
You can't... be crying.

13:31.052 --> 13:36.080
You're going to go back to
your parents' place, and you're...

13:36.625 --> 13:38.183
You're going to be happy...

13:38.226 --> 13:42.856
Idiot Usagi...
You're the one who's crying.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.032
It's funny...
I promised not to cry.

13:48.069 --> 13:51.869
I made up my mind that I would
see you off without crying...

14:00.215 --> 14:01.614
Usagi! I don't want to!!

14:03.485 --> 14:08.616
Be on good terms with
your parents of the future...!!

14:18.867 --> 14:21.097
Good-bye, Usagi!

14:33.481 --> 14:35.711
Usagi!

14:39.020 --> 14:40.920
A terrible thing has happened!

14:42.691 --> 14:45.285
One of the Death Busters'
eggs was still left.

14:45.327 --> 14:47.557
And that egg turned into a Daimohn!

14:47.596 --> 14:49.860
The pure hearts of people all over
town are getting sucked into it!

14:49.898 --> 14:50.830
Where is it?

14:50.865 --> 14:53.390
At the Tenoh Sandbank...
Where Mugen Academy used to be!

14:58.506 --> 15:01.339
Mama! Mama!!

15:13.888 --> 15:17.847
I can't ever forgive you for taking
pure hearts from everyone!

15:18.760 --> 15:21.991
For love and justice,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

15:22.030 --> 15:23.861
Sailor Moon!

15:23.898 --> 15:25.957
And the Sailor Team!

15:26.001 --> 15:28.367
And I, Tuxedo Mask...

15:30.372 --> 15:33.637
In the name of the moon,
we'll punish you!

15:35.210 --> 15:36.302
That doesn't work at all!

15:37.512 --> 15:38.774
Pure hearts...

15:38.813 --> 15:40.246
Pure hearts...

15:40.281 --> 15:43.682
BURNING...

15:46.755 --> 15:49.246
...MANDALA!!

15:54.729 --> 15:56.993
Dammit!

15:59.267 --> 16:00.427
SPARKLING...

16:00.468 --> 16:03.164
...WIDE PRESSURE!

16:05.440 --> 16:07.965
Rangy!

16:11.413 --> 16:13.745
SHINE AQUA...

16:13.815 --> 16:15.680
...ILLUSION!

16:22.891 --> 16:23.915
VENUS...

16:23.958 --> 16:25.152
...LOVE ME...

16:25.193 --> 16:27.161
...CHAIN!

16:40.875 --> 16:43.105
Pure hearts...

16:43.144 --> 16:44.076
I-It's strong...!!

16:56.591 --> 16:58.582
It's Crystal Tokyo...

16:59.260 --> 17:01.592
Papa... Mama...!!

17:11.206 --> 17:14.004
Pure hearts...

17:29.557 --> 17:31.889
Pure hearts...

17:33.495 --> 17:34.928
Pure hearts...

17:34.963 --> 17:38.626
I-If only I had the Grail...
I could become Super Sailor Moon!

17:38.666 --> 17:41.328
S-Sailor Moon...

17:42.237 --> 17:44.330
PINK SUGAR...

17:44.372 --> 17:47.398
...HEART ATTACK!!

17:49.310 --> 17:50.299
Chibi Moon!

17:50.345 --> 17:52.779
Chibi Moon!

17:54.816 --> 17:58.308
The Sailor Team are my dear friends!

17:58.486 --> 18:02.183
I can't forgive you for
going after their pure hearts!

18:02.223 --> 18:06.284
For love and Justice, an apprentice
to a pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

18:06.327 --> 18:08.659
Sailor Chibi Moon!

18:08.696 --> 18:10.994
In the name of the future moon...

18:11.032 --> 18:13.000
...I'll punish you!

18:15.203 --> 18:17.535
Look out!

18:17.572 --> 18:19.301
It's no time to be posing!!

18:26.781 --> 18:31.047
A maiden's heart that thinks of others is
stronger and more beautiful than anything else.

18:31.085 --> 18:36.421
I, Tuxedo Mask, will not forgive anyone
who threatens the safety off air maidens!

18:36.457 --> 18:39.051
Sailor Moon, believe in your friends!

18:39.594 --> 18:40.322
Right!

18:50.471 --> 18:53.406
That's right...
Even if I don't have a Grail...

18:53.441 --> 18:58.401
...I can protect everyone with my
pure heart that cares about others!

19:00.582 --> 19:04.609
MOON SPIRAL...

19:04.652 --> 19:07.780
...HEART...

19:07.822 --> 19:10.256
...ATTACK!!

19:19.434 --> 19:21.766
LOVELY!!

19:32.180 --> 19:34.774
You did it, Sailor Moon!

19:34.816 --> 19:37.512
Well done, Sailor Moon.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.213
Perhaps the Grail...

19:39.254 --> 19:43.520
...is actually the pure heart itself
that cares about others.

19:47.195 --> 19:49.959
Wow! What a beautiful sunrise!

19:49.998 --> 19:51.659
Why are you here!?

19:51.699 --> 19:54.395
You guys are so helpless without me!

19:54.435 --> 19:55.527
What was that!?

19:55.570 --> 19:57.629
All right, everyone, let's get her!

20:05.580 --> 20:07.411
Oh, it's Luna-P!

20:07.448 --> 20:09.040
It's got a letter in its mouth.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.284
"Dear Small Lady.

20:11.319 --> 20:13.378
Thanks for the souvenirs!

20:13.421 --> 20:17.858
Don't be too much of a nuisance to your
big sister Usagi, and be a good girl!

20:17.892 --> 20:19.120
Bye!

20:19.160 --> 20:22.857
P.S. Bring more souvenirs
back next time!"

20:23.331 --> 20:26.323
It is Usagi after all...

20:28.836 --> 20:31.168
So, I'll be around for a bit more!

20:34.168 --> 20:38.168
