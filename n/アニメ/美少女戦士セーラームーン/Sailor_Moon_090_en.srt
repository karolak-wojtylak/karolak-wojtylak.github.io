1
00:00:01,948 --> 00:00:07,181
The tough battle has ended, and
peace has returned... or so I thought.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,381
We're in ninth grade now!?

3
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:11,983
We have to study for
high school entrance exams!

4
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:16,155
And now there are new enemies
on top of all of this!

5
00:00:16,196 --> 00:00:17,356
Sheesh!

6
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:20,230
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you all!

7
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:39,036
Silence is approaching!

8
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:44,046
It's no good... I can't win!

9
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:48,618
Are you the Messiah?

10
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:54,985
Please help everyone!

11
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:02,759
Wait!

12
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:33,763
What's wrong, Rei?

13
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,460
You seemed to be having a nightmare.

14
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,868
Oh, um, sorry, it's nothing.

15
00:01:38,904 --> 00:01:40,235
It's just that...

16
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:41,705
I had a strange dream...

17
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,298
A strange dream?

18
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:47,177
I had a weird dream, too.

19
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:50,704
I went to the hospital because
I ate too much ice cream.

20
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:52,216
And there...

21
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:56,119
Mamo-chan was brought in on a stretcher
because he ate too many mooncakes!

22
00:01:56,154 --> 00:02:00,784
And we bumped into each other
in the kitchen of the hospital...

23
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:02,157
Isn't it funny?

24
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,928
It's funny...

25
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:06,692
But it's no time for us
to be having dreams like that.

26
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:09,963
Usagi, how did you do on
that exam we had two days ago?

27
00:02:13,438 --> 00:02:16,498
Well, I don't think
I got zero points...

28
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:19,342
We're in ninth grade now!

29
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:21,744
We have less than a year before
high school entrance exams!

30
00:02:22,214 --> 00:02:22,839
Yeah...

31
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:25,577
We have to catch up academically;
we're behind because of our battles!

32
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:28,745
They say, "Don't regret
the fish eggs from before."

33
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:32,085
Wait, Usagi. Don't memorize that.

34
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:34,991
It should be "No use
crying over spilt milk."

35
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:37,291
Oh yeah, you can say it that way, too.

36
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:40,127
But "the fish eggs from before"
sounds better to me...

37
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:40,995
Yeah.

38
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:44,764
Like when Artemis eats the fish eggs
I was looking forward to snacking on...

39
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,430
I think, why didn't I eat them earlier?

40
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,336
But you'd get it wrong on the exam.

41
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,274
Hey, Ami, how do you solve this?

42
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:57,274
For this problem, you do this...

43
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:35,811
Kaorinite.

44
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:38,823
Right here.

45
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,518
The Daimohn Egg has
finally been completed.

46
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:48,500
Daimohn selects humans with pure
hearts, and steals their hearts.

47
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,296
Pure hearts?

48
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:51,563
Yes!

49
00:03:51,603 --> 00:03:55,471
The holy grail that allows the holder
to do anything they wish to this world!

50
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:59,603
It will appear when the three
talismans are gathered at one place!

51
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:03,206
The three talismans are
the crystallization of...

52
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:07,082
...the pure, yes, pure
hearts of the chosen ones!

53
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:12,113
Therefore, if we find the chosen ones,
and get a hold of the talismans--

54
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:17,227
We will have the holy grail,
and the world, in our hands!!

55
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:45,022
I'm at a loss!

56
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:50,853
This score is bad no matter
how you look at it...

57
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:57,699
I wonder what Mom and Dad
will say when they see this...

58
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:00,364
More over, what if Rei sees this...

59
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:06,977
And of course, I always bump
into Rei at times like this!

60
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,175
OW!

61
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:13,377
Usagi?

62
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:17,721
Sheesh, Usagi! You're just
standing there all spaced out!

63
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:21,592
You were all spaced out yourself, Rei!

64
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:22,718
Move over!

65
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:26,861
Well, I can't blame you for being
so down with a test score like that.

66
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:29,359
Well, excuse me!

67
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:35,870
But, Usagi, you have a lot of good traits
outside of studying, so don't worry.

68
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:39,103
Oh? You're not like how
you usually are, Rei.

69
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:47,008
You think so...?

70
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:50,112
Hey, what do you dream of
doing in the future, Usagi?

71
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:53,890
Dream...?

72
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,723
I don't know, everything
is so mixed up...

73
00:05:56,762 --> 00:05:58,127
How about you, Rei?

74
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,090
Me?

75
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:08,631
A singer-songwriter, a model,
a wonderful voice actress, and...

76
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:14,339
And?

77
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:16,846
I can't!

78
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:22,182
A loving wife to someone I love!
I can't say that!

79
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,211
But you just did.

80
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:28,158
You're going to marry
Mamoru someday, right, Usagi?

81
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:30,957
Oh! You embarrass me!
So embarrassing! Embarrassing!

82
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:34,957
With a pathetic score like that, Mamoru
would be more embarrassed than you are.

83
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:36,964
That hurt.

84
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:41,533
Studying isn't everything,
but for the future...

85
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:45,202
Usagi, you have to try a little
harder for Mamoru's sake as well.

86
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:47,473
Well, I'll see you later.

87
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,846
Cheer up, Usagi.

88
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:53,976
That's really your only good trait.

89
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:56,154
Sheesh!

90
00:06:56,188 --> 00:07:03,094
She talks tough, but she honestly wants
the best for me and all of our friends.

91
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:04,493
Thanks, Rei.

92
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,588
Hurry and appear...

93
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:37,822
...the one with a pure heart.

94
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:50,165
But what Rei says IS right...

95
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,173
If Mamo-chan saw a test
score like this...

96
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:59,012
This is horrible...

97
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,018
...he would say, I'm sure...

98
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:06,348
Such great weather out today!

99
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:08,086
Usako...

100
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:14,588
Well, so we're all getting
together at Rei's house to study!

101
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:17,025
Looks like you should do that...

102
00:08:17,068 --> 00:08:20,936
Since we haven't been able to study much
due to all the fighting we've been doing.

103
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,703
Then, it will be a little lonely, but I
guess we won't be able to date for a bit.

104
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:30,814
Well, uh, I don't think...
you need to go... that far...

105
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:32,908
Now, go do your best.

106
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:34,748
Thanks.

107
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:35,946
See ya.

108
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:40,949
This is tough!

109
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:52,226
What was that dream last night...?

110
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,234
Rin-byou-tou-sha-kai-jin-retsu-zai-zen!

111
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:11,115
No good... I can't feel anything...

112
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:19,257
I wonder if it's nothing after all...

113
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:29,766
Number 27...

114
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:48,251
I hope that everyone will live happily
without anything bad happening...

115
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:50,492
What!?

116
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,500
MIKUJI!

117
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:08,373
W-What is this...?

118
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:12,850
I will have your pure heart
that worries about your friends!

119
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:17,343
Fighting here will get Grandpa
and the others involved too!

120
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:59,823
Your fortune today is VERY BAD.

121
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:02,159
Daimohn Mikuji.

122
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,761
There might be a talisman
hidden within this girl.

123
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:08,272
Take her pure heart.

124
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,269
Daimohn?

125
00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:11,773
MIKUJI!

126
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,118
It is a matter of time
before we see results.

127
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:30,253
I shall go seek other humans that have
the possibility of holding talismans.

128
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:43,372
I'd rather go on a date with Mamo-chan
instead of studying after all...

129
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:44,636
You can't.

130
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:46,803
I'll go do that after all!

131
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:51,578
Now, Usagi! You promised everyone
that you would study, didn't you!?

132
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:53,516
BUT!

133
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,712
If you don't go, I'll--

134
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:58,218
All right!

135
00:11:58,256 --> 00:12:01,817
Really, Luna, you don't
understand what a girl feels...

136
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,193
You mean how a sloth feels.

137
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:07,991
That's Rei's voice!

138
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:09,397
I wonder what's going on?

139
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:19,443
W-W-W-What is that!?

140
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:22,571
I don't know,
but you should transform.

141
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:27,643
MOON CRYSTAL POWER...

142
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:30,279
...MAKE UP!

143
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,250
Hold it right there!

144
00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:12,195
For love and justice...

145
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,994
...the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

146
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,997
Sailor Moon!

147
00:13:22,707 --> 00:13:23,833
Sailor Moon?

148
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:28,339
I can't for give you for harassing
my pure-hearted friend!

149
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:33,606
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

150
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:37,847
She was targeted because
of her pure heart!

151
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:40,123
The target is a pure heart?

152
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,116
Your fortune is...

153
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:46,689
...VERY BAD!

154
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,402
What is that monster?

155
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,532
Another monster?

156
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,701
Let's transform and fight!

157
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:03,474
Your fortunes are...

158
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:10,012
BAD!

159
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
It's strong...

160
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,555
Several times stronger
than previous enemies...

161
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:21,063
How should I get rid of
these pesky interruptions?

162
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:27,671
Who is that!?

163
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:35,242
Ruffian who creates a storm of
riots in the warm sun of spring!

164
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,679
Retreat now!

165
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:39,447
Shall I tell your fortune too?

166
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:41,809
Now, Sailor Moon!

167
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:43,311
Okay!

168
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,736
MOON PRINCESS...

169
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:09,975
...HALATION!

170
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,215
Damn you!

171
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:17,187
VERY BAD TRIANGLE!

172
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:29,865
THE MOST UNLUCKY DAY!

173
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,686
Can such a thing...?

174
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:57,217
Sailor... Mo-

175
00:15:57,662 --> 00:15:59,721
Usako!

176
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:01,793
Your fortune is...

177
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,232
BAD!

178
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,760
Tuxedo Mask!

179
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:08,769
I can't watch anymore.

180
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:10,068
Luna!

181
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:11,302
Damn you!

182
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,379
- Artemis!
- Luna!

183
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:19,815
Is that the last interruption?

184
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:23,014
Then, I shall take my time
to get the pure heart.

185
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:34,655
Stop!

186
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,074
Rei!

187
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:48,373
Rei!!

188
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:52,410
Rei! Hold yourself together!

189
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,551
Rei! Rei!!

190
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:57,713
What do you dream of doing
in the future, Usagi?

191
00:16:57,755 --> 00:17:05,890
Me? A singer-songwriter, amodel,
a wonderful voiceactress, and...

192
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:12,665
I can't! A loving wife to someone
I love. I can't say that!

193
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,967
Cheer up, Usagi.

194
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:18,669
That's really your only good trait.

195
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,109
Usagi!

196
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:23,710
Rei...

197
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:31,247
There must be a talisman inside
this crystal of her pure heart.

198
00:17:32,123 --> 00:17:33,181
Give that back!

199
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:36,159
Give that back to Rei!

200
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:38,754
I won't forgive you!

201
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:42,624
Humans...

202
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:46,159
Such pathetic creaturrrrrrr...

203
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:52,806
Wha--!?
What in the world is going on!?

204
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:56,439
EVIL WARD!

205
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:21,337
Rei! Rei!

206
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:22,201
Hold yourself together!

207
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,367
- Rei!
- REI!!

208
00:18:27,144 --> 00:18:28,236
Rei!

209
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,272
Hold yourself together! Rei...

210
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:35,109
This is not a talisman!

211
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,382
Looks like they had the wrong target.

212
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,887
A trip wasted.

213
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,658
Rei...

214
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:47,763
Answer me!

215
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,149
Rei...?

216
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:22,923
She came to...

217
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,162
I...

218
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,733
Rei is back to normal!

219
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:34,570
I'm so glad!

220
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,079
Usagi...

221
00:19:40,217 --> 00:19:41,741
Are you sure you're not hurt at all?

222
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:43,686
Yeah, I'm all right.

223
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:45,120
You don't feel pain?

224
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:47,021
No.

225
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:48,787
Do you itch anywhere?

226
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:50,054
No.

227
00:19:50,094 --> 00:19:54,554
- Do you have anything you want to eat?
- Those two...

228
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,500
Don't cry anymore.

229
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:03,702
Kaorinite. It seems the target
wasn't the holder of a talisman.

230
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:06,402
Correct. We also had an
uncalculated interruption.

231
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:09,208
I will be careful in the future.

232
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:13,307
The new enemy seems to be
after people with pure hearts.

233
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:16,809
They said something about
talismans being inside them...

234
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:20,312
And those two mysterious people...

235
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:26,727
A... new battle is about to begin...?

236
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:33,727
