00:01.900 --> 00:03.925
If you have just a little bit of courage...

00:03.969 --> 00:06.403
...people can really be soldiers.

00:06.438 --> 00:08.235
If you have feelings for other people...

00:08.273 --> 00:10.764
...anyone can become a messiah.

00:10.809 --> 00:12.572
No matter how much you change...

00:12.610 --> 00:15.773
...please don't forget that there
are people who care for you.

00:15.814 --> 00:18.977
I'll make sure to save you!!

00:22.936 --> 00:24.665
I'm sorry...

00:24.704 --> 00:29.403
Chibiusa... I'm sorry...

00:32.746 --> 00:35.738
She finally went away...

00:46.192 --> 00:47.318
Hotaru!!

00:47.360 --> 00:50.727
Give it up already!
She is no longer Hotaru!!

00:53.099 --> 00:57.229
That's right...
Hotaru Tomoe died just now.

00:59.105 --> 01:00.231
You're lying!!

01:03.877 --> 01:09.042
The giant power that's fast
approaching through this Tau Nebula...

01:09.082 --> 01:11.448
...is the master of
us Death Busters!

01:11.484 --> 01:14.612
The ruler of silence, Pharaoh 90!

01:14.654 --> 01:17.555
Now, if I can get a hold of the Grail...

01:17.591 --> 01:22.119
...Pharaoh 90 will appear,
and the age of silence will begin!

01:26.199 --> 01:28.326
Then, we will defeat you now!

01:31.338 --> 01:32.635
Resign yourself!.

01:32.672 --> 01:34.230
WORLD...

01:34.274 --> 01:36.242
...SHAKING!

01:36.276 --> 01:38.039
DEEP...

01:38.078 --> 01:39.841
...SUBMERGE!

01:43.049 --> 01:44.016
You can't!

01:49.522 --> 01:50.750
Why, thank you.

01:50.790 --> 01:51.415
You idiot!

01:51.458 --> 01:52.550
Don't get in our way!

01:59.799 --> 02:00.891
Shoot!

02:12.746 --> 02:16.773
If you don't want these two killed right
before your eyes, hand over the Grail.

02:17.017 --> 02:18.541
You can't!!

02:21.688 --> 02:23.883
Shall I get rid of one of them first?

02:25.759 --> 02:26.384
Wait!

02:27.427 --> 02:31.625
I-If you hand the Grail over to her,
I will detest you!!

02:31.965 --> 02:33.125
But...

02:33.533 --> 02:34.966
Stop it!

02:35.001 --> 02:36.263
Sailor Moon!

02:45.645 --> 02:47.579
Stop it!!

02:57.424 --> 02:58.823
Hotaru...

02:59.693 --> 03:02.355
Hotaru's... dad?

03:05.465 --> 03:07.330
Hotaru...

03:07.767 --> 03:09.928
It's me...

03:09.969 --> 03:11.834
Your Papa...

03:11.871 --> 03:16.069
Hotaru... you ended up
like this because of me...

03:18.011 --> 03:20.138
The empty shell of Germatoid...?

03:20.180 --> 03:23.343
You're just a shell!
Don't touch me! How filthy!

03:33.626 --> 03:35.685
Stop it already!

03:35.729 --> 03:38.129
Stop it...

03:38.765 --> 03:41.131
Please...

03:45.605 --> 03:47.072
Everyone, hang in there!

03:47.574 --> 03:49.303
It's gaining power...

03:49.676 --> 03:51.234
I won't lose!

03:51.544 --> 03:53.739
We won't let this Daimohn
loose into the city!

03:59.786 --> 04:01.777
Hotaru...

04:04.090 --> 04:06.251
Papa...

04:12.031 --> 04:14.465
Papa...

04:15.735 --> 04:17.362
Impossible!

04:18.171 --> 04:20.105
Hotaru...

04:30.683 --> 04:33.846
The body is rejecting me...?

04:38.424 --> 04:41.359
This hurts, Papa...

04:46.099 --> 04:48.192
Finish her, Sailor Moon!

04:48.234 --> 04:49.428
No!

04:49.936 --> 04:51.904
Because...

04:51.938 --> 04:54.202
Hotaru is alive...

04:54.407 --> 04:57.103
Don't be fooled!!

04:58.978 --> 05:02.106
Hotaru, are you in pain...?

05:02.882 --> 05:04.179
The Grail...

05:04.217 --> 05:05.309
The Grail?

05:05.351 --> 05:09.151
If I don't have the Grail...
I no longer...

05:11.391 --> 05:14.451
Hang in there, Hotaru...

05:14.494 --> 05:16.985
This Grail...

05:17.030 --> 05:19.726
...where is it, Hotaru!?

05:20.967 --> 05:22.229
Papa...?

05:34.747 --> 05:37.739
Why, Sailor Moon!?

05:47.894 --> 05:51.295
You're not the messiah or anything...

05:51.331 --> 05:54.232
You have no right to do with
the Grail as you please!!

05:54.267 --> 05:56.428
Hotaru is still alive...

05:56.469 --> 05:58.198
She's alive!!

05:58.238 --> 06:02.868
We can't save the world unless
innocent little Hotaru dies...!?

06:03.776 --> 06:05.767
That just can't be true!!

06:10.316 --> 06:12.784
Oh... is this...

06:12.819 --> 06:14.286
Is that the Grail?

06:18.791 --> 06:21.157
Please, can I...?

06:21.194 --> 06:22.786
For Hotaru...?

06:27.667 --> 06:29.294
Thank you...

06:32.972 --> 06:34.564
Now, Hotaru...

06:34.607 --> 06:37.542
The Grail... You want this?

06:37.577 --> 06:39.545
Yes... Hurry...

06:53.426 --> 06:54.916
Dammit!!

06:59.399 --> 07:01.390
Sailor Moon...

07:02.802 --> 07:06.329
After I greet Pharaoh 90, I will
give you a special choice...

07:06.372 --> 07:09.933
...to continue living as
a body for a Daimohn.

07:10.143 --> 07:12.668
Hotaru!
Hotaru, you can hear me, right!?

07:12.712 --> 07:14.441
Hotaru!!

07:16.149 --> 07:18.140
It's no use...

07:18.184 --> 07:20.448
No matter what you do,
it's too late now.

07:20.920 --> 07:26.449
Hotaru or this world...
I won't let either go as you please!!

07:26.793 --> 07:28.693
Why don't you give up?

07:28.728 --> 07:33.062
This Grail is an ultra-pure
crystal among all pure hearts.

07:33.099 --> 07:40.471
Love, hate, happiness, anger, sadness...
elevated to the highest level.

07:42.175 --> 07:45.144
To win against Pharaoh 90
after he takes in the Grail...

07:45.178 --> 07:48.477
...you'd need to create a pure
heart crystal that surpasses it!

07:51.784 --> 07:54.947
There's no way you can win!!

08:09.369 --> 08:10.495
What!?

08:10.703 --> 08:12.500
What's going on inside!?

08:14.340 --> 08:15.773
Sailor Moon!

08:22.715 --> 08:24.012
The Grail...!?

08:31.424 --> 08:34.518
Yes, this way, Pharaoh 90!!

08:51.711 --> 08:55.545
Look! This is the result of
your methods full of idealism!!

08:57.750 --> 09:00.514
MOON COSMIC POWER!!

09:15.501 --> 09:17.969
You, who cannot even undergo
the second transformation...

09:18.004 --> 09:20.802
...cannot stop the silence!

09:20.840 --> 09:24.674
The world for the master
and myself will now begin!

09:27.346 --> 09:29.678
Impossible!!

10:56.002 --> 10:57.560
Hotaru...

10:59.138 --> 11:00.070
Papa...?

11:01.307 --> 11:03.207
Hotaru?

11:03.242 --> 11:05.574
Papa...

11:05.611 --> 11:07.169
Hotaru...

11:07.213 --> 11:09.681
Papa... where are you?

11:09.715 --> 11:12.275
Where are you?
It's dark here...

11:12.318 --> 11:13.785
I'm right here.

11:13.819 --> 11:16.185
I have to save Chibiusa...

11:16.222 --> 11:18.986
Papa, let me out of here...

11:19.025 --> 11:22.654
I'm sorry...
I don't know what to do...

11:23.596 --> 11:26.030
Forgive me...

11:26.065 --> 11:29.091
If only I could go back...
to those days once more...

11:33.673 --> 11:35.868
Papa!

11:36.142 --> 11:38.110
Hotaru!

11:39.312 --> 11:41.109
Papa!

11:41.948 --> 11:44.109
Sheesh, papa!

11:45.518 --> 11:47.110
Papa...

11:49.121 --> 11:51.385
Papa...

11:54.794 --> 11:56.625
I'm sorry...

12:05.471 --> 12:07.132
Papa.

12:14.647 --> 12:16.638
H-Hotaru...

12:24.257 --> 12:25.451
Don't come here...

12:25.491 --> 12:27.083
You little pest...

12:27.126 --> 12:28.184
Hurry up and...

12:28.227 --> 12:30.491
...begone!

12:30.529 --> 12:32.121
Even if you live...

12:32.164 --> 12:34.428
...your life is useless...

12:34.467 --> 12:36.560
Do not get...

12:36.602 --> 12:38.160
...in our way!

12:40.273 --> 12:43.140
Begone! Be destroyed!

12:43.542 --> 12:44.702
No!

12:44.744 --> 12:46.974
I will definitely NOT!

12:48.514 --> 12:50.607
Dammit...

12:50.650 --> 12:53.016
I... I...

12:57.390 --> 12:59.085
I have people dear to me!!

13:13.572 --> 13:15.199
H-Hotaru...

13:16.208 --> 13:19.200
The revival of the Warrior of Ruin...!?

13:30.122 --> 13:31.885
You are...?

13:34.927 --> 13:38.328
Chibiusa... You're all right now...

13:53.679 --> 13:56.147
Sailor Saturn...!

13:56.182 --> 13:58.013
Hotaru...?

14:00.219 --> 14:03.120
Thank you, Chibiusa...

14:03.656 --> 14:05.715
Thank you.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.723
Pharaoh 90 is gaining power!

14:11.831 --> 14:16.097
Now, we have no means
to stop the silence...

14:16.869 --> 14:18.598
Hotaru!

14:43.863 --> 14:47.390
In the end...
Everything we did goes to waste...?

14:48.367 --> 14:49.891
This is the end.

14:51.103 --> 14:54.834
Are you satisfied with
this, Sailor Moon!?

14:56.675 --> 14:59.109
Answer me!!

15:01.881 --> 15:04.372
Sailor Moon.

15:14.393 --> 15:17.191
Thank you for protecting my body...

15:17.229 --> 15:19.322
It's all thanks to you.

15:19.365 --> 15:20.923
Sailor Saturn...

15:22.401 --> 15:23.925
Hotaru?

15:25.538 --> 15:26.436
Hotaru!!

15:27.773 --> 15:30.571
I am no longer Hotaru.

15:30.609 --> 15:34.602
The only one who can save
the world from silence now is me.

15:34.647 --> 15:35.944
Leave everything else to me.

15:35.981 --> 15:37.642
Wait! I'll go with you!

15:37.683 --> 15:38.877
No...

15:38.918 --> 15:46.086
To defeat Pharaoh 90, you need to enter
its core and make it all disappear at once...

15:46.125 --> 15:49.925
I don't know about Super Sailor Moon,
but as you stand now...

15:49.962 --> 15:54.922
...you can't even enter Pharaoh 90
now that it has the power of the Grail.

15:54.967 --> 15:56.958
This is my job now.

15:57.937 --> 16:01.464
When you defeat Pharaoh 90...
what will happen to you?

16:02.274 --> 16:04.765
The reason I am called
the Warrior of Ruin...

16:04.810 --> 16:08.837
...is because I am given enough
power to destroy a planet.

16:08.881 --> 16:09.973
However...

16:10.015 --> 16:13.416
...when I use that power,
I myself will also...

16:15.187 --> 16:16.449
You can't!

16:21.994 --> 16:24.326
Farewell...

16:37.510 --> 16:38.374
Hotaru!

16:51.257 --> 16:53.851
CRISIS MAKE UP!

16:58.864 --> 17:01.458
CRISIS MAKE UP!

17:05.671 --> 17:07.901
CRISIS MAKE UP!

17:08.407 --> 17:11.001
CRISIS MAKE UP!

17:11.510 --> 17:13.910
Please, transform!!

17:24.323 --> 17:27.918
CRISIS MAKE UP...

17:29.862 --> 17:31.921
Sailor Moon...

17:32.798 --> 17:34.925
Sailor Moon...

17:35.868 --> 17:37.927
Sailor Moon...

17:39.038 --> 17:40.938
Sailor Moon...

17:52.685 --> 17:54.949
CRISIS...

17:55.654 --> 17:59.715
MAKE UP!

18:24.850 --> 18:27.478
Farewell...

19:23.075 --> 19:26.943
If you are able to
meet the real Messiah...

19:27.479 --> 19:30.414
The real... Messiah...!?

19:33.414 --> 19:37.414
