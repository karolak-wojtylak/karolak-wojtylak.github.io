WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:03.895
There's a talisman
inside my heart?!

00:03.935 --> 00:06.529
On top of that, the enemy
found out who I really am!!!

00:06.571 --> 00:09.438
Kaorinite took my brooch,
so I can't transform!

00:09.474 --> 00:12.875
And Mamo-chan got imprisoned
in glass trying to protect me!

00:12.911 --> 00:15.436
We're in huge trouble!
Tell me, everyone!

00:15.480 --> 00:18.711
What in the world
should I do?!

00:29.500 --> 00:31.263
Tuxedo Mask!!

00:36.641 --> 00:38.108
That's enough!

00:38.376 --> 00:41.868
The pretty soldiers in sailor
suits now make their entrance!

00:42.513 --> 00:44.674
So, you've shown up...

00:47.018 --> 00:49.384
Usagi Tsukino and
the Sailor Soldiers!

00:49.821 --> 00:53.450
If you want to save Tuxedo Mask,
come to Tokyo Tower!

00:53.491 --> 00:56.153
That will be where
you all will die!

00:59.897 --> 01:01.728
Mamo-chan!

01:01.766 --> 01:03.393
Usagi!

01:06.070 --> 01:07.765
That's...!

01:08.406 --> 01:10.203
Neptune and Uranus...

01:10.241 --> 01:13.574
I'm sure they were
after Usagi's pure heart!

01:13.611 --> 01:15.602
Those guys are like hyenas...!

01:17.381 --> 01:18.279
Usagi!

01:18.316 --> 01:19.908
Wait!

01:19.984 --> 01:21.884
I'm sure the enemy
is waiting for us...

01:21.919 --> 01:23.352
...with a trap
ready to spring!

01:23.387 --> 01:25.150
Now that you can't
transform, Usagi...

01:25.189 --> 01:27.180
...we have to come
up with some plan!

01:29.360 --> 01:31.521
But, but...

01:34.098 --> 01:37.397
Because Mamo-chan
tried to save me...

01:39.504 --> 01:42.405
I'm still going
to save Mamo-chan!

01:43.508 --> 01:44.941
Usagi!

01:52.049 --> 01:53.311
Haruka!

01:53.384 --> 01:55.579
Hey, buns-head.

01:55.620 --> 01:57.281
Going somewhere so late?

01:57.889 --> 02:00.187
Please! Haruka, can you
give me a ride?!

02:01.793 --> 02:03.090
Sure...

02:06.430 --> 02:08.261
Usagi! Usagi!

02:08.299 --> 02:10.164
Usagi, you're so...

02:10.601 --> 02:13.001
She's not thinking at all...!

02:13.037 --> 02:16.370
Do you think you can do
everything all by yourself?!

02:23.014 --> 02:24.481
Usagi.

02:24.515 --> 02:27.109
Have you made up
with your boyfriend?

02:29.487 --> 02:31.045
Y-Yeah...

02:33.491 --> 02:34.822
Buns-head...

02:37.094 --> 02:41.224
Humans all live by
sacrificing someone in the end.

02:41.632 --> 02:43.759
Don't you think so?

02:45.036 --> 02:47.095
What do you mean by that?

02:47.138 --> 02:49.265
For instance...

02:49.307 --> 02:51.639
Let's say that someone
you know is in danger...

02:51.676 --> 02:54.042
...because they were
covering your back.

02:55.947 --> 02:58.211
At times like that,
the person in danger...

02:58.249 --> 03:02.652
...won't think about himself
and wishes you to be safe.

03:03.454 --> 03:07.390
It could be your friend
or it could be your parent...

03:08.392 --> 03:11.953
Everyone lives by
stepping upon someone else.

03:21.405 --> 03:23.498
I know that we
will have victims!

03:23.541 --> 03:25.031
Then why?!

03:25.076 --> 03:27.169
It's our mission!

03:28.212 --> 03:30.544
Nobody wants any victims.

03:30.882 --> 03:34.545
But if that's going to
save the entire world...

03:34.619 --> 03:36.018
What would you do?

03:47.832 --> 03:49.959
Don't you think so, Usagi?

03:52.270 --> 03:53.635
But...

03:53.671 --> 03:56.970
The people doing the stepping
might be fine with that...

03:57.008 --> 03:59.272
...but what about the people
who are getting stepped on?!

04:00.011 --> 04:03.276
Shouldn't you think about the
people who are being sacrificed?!

04:03.781 --> 04:09.048
I can't ignore other people
suffering just to save myself!

04:09.587 --> 04:11.384
It might be impossible
for me alone...

04:11.422 --> 04:13.390
...but if we all joined forces...

04:13.424 --> 04:16.951
...we'd be able to find a way
to avoid sacrificing anyone!

04:16.994 --> 04:21.556
- I'm sure of it!
- Usagi... You're a kind girl.

04:28.839 --> 04:30.272
Is this the place?

04:30.308 --> 04:32.708
Yes. Thank you very much.

04:44.322 --> 04:46.222
Are you all right
with this, Haruka?

04:47.191 --> 04:49.887
That girl...is going to die.

04:51.796 --> 04:53.730
We can't help it!

04:53.764 --> 04:59.066
To get the Grail, to save
the world from silence...

04:59.136 --> 05:02.071
...buns-head will have
to be our sacrifice!!

05:14.485 --> 05:16.715
Welcome, Usagi Tsukino.

05:17.722 --> 05:20.520
Now, get on the elevator.

05:20.558 --> 05:23.083
I will show you a route
straight to heaven.

05:39.176 --> 05:41.303
- No good!
- Looks like it won't even budge.

05:42.346 --> 05:44.007
Guess we'll have
to break it open!

05:44.048 --> 05:47.279
That's impossible! There's a
strong barrier on the front side!

05:47.718 --> 05:50.414
- Let's use the stairs.
- That seems a better way.

05:50.454 --> 05:52.149
All right, let's go!

05:52.189 --> 05:53.781
Wait, Venus!

05:53.824 --> 05:56.520
Whether or not this will
succeed depends on you!

06:04.568 --> 06:06.035
Tuxedo Mask...!

06:06.570 --> 06:07.764
Welcome...

06:07.805 --> 06:12.765
But any closer and I'll
shatter this glass sculpture.

06:13.577 --> 06:15.772
I don't care what
happens to me!

06:15.913 --> 06:19.280
But don't lay a
finger on Tuxedo Mask!

06:19.316 --> 06:21.841
All right... Senishenta!

06:21.886 --> 06:22.910
Yes!

06:41.405 --> 06:42.667
What?!

06:47.878 --> 06:49.311
You...!

06:49.713 --> 06:51.305
Well?

06:54.285 --> 06:57.812
This is...! It's not.
This isn't a talisman!

06:58.989 --> 06:59.978
What?!

07:00.024 --> 07:04.017
Despite the brilliance it emits,
it still isn't a talisman?!

07:04.061 --> 07:05.426
That can't be....!

07:05.463 --> 07:09.729
How brilliant it is seems to
be only a barometer of purity...

07:09.767 --> 07:11.997
...and has nothing to do with
whether or not it's a talisman.

07:13.571 --> 07:15.835
Looks like this was
another wasted trip.

07:26.484 --> 07:28.384
Are you all right?

07:30.754 --> 07:32.654
You guys saved me...?

07:33.357 --> 07:34.654
I'm glad...

07:35.426 --> 07:37.485
Even if it wasn't a talisman...

07:37.528 --> 07:40.691
...I'll have your life,
Usagi Tsukino--

07:40.731 --> 07:42.221
Or, rather, Sailor Moon!

07:44.802 --> 07:45.996
What...?!

07:47.338 --> 07:49.397
That girl
isn't Sailor Moon!

07:52.343 --> 07:54.038
You're...?!

07:54.979 --> 07:58.176
Stalking after an
innocent girl's pure heart...

07:58.215 --> 08:00.581
...and then mistaking
her for me on top of it!

08:00.618 --> 08:01.252
Ten million insults
and a thousand needles!

08:01.252 --> 08:02.879
Y-You're joking...
Ten million insults
and a thousand needles!

08:06.257 --> 08:08.987
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

08:34.051 --> 08:35.211
You're...

08:36.654 --> 08:38.144
...Sailor Moon?!

08:41.225 --> 08:42.453
Minako...

08:42.726 --> 08:44.125
But...

08:45.062 --> 08:47.053
You're different, somehow...

08:47.464 --> 08:49.989
What! Do you have something
against my perfect dis--

08:50.067 --> 08:51.329
She's the real one!

08:51.368 --> 08:53.302
We guarantee that she is!

08:54.805 --> 08:57.933
Then, who is this girl-SHENTA?!

08:58.742 --> 09:00.004
I have no clue!

09:00.044 --> 09:02.478
Maybe she's a fan of
mine or something?

09:02.513 --> 09:05.175
First of all,
such a clumsy crybaby...

09:05.249 --> 09:07.308
...can't possibly
be a Sailor Soldier!

09:07.351 --> 09:08.978
- Yeah!
- To be a Sailor Soldier...

09:09.053 --> 09:10.418
T-Then, this is a fake?!

09:10.454 --> 09:12.422
...you have to be smart,
attractive, and cool like me!

09:12.456 --> 09:15.619
Venus, you seem awfully
sincere about all that.

09:16.493 --> 09:18.085
What a farce.

09:18.162 --> 09:20.687
If you'll excuse us...

09:21.699 --> 09:23.462
I won't let you get
away like that!

09:27.571 --> 09:29.562
I have to take care
of you thoroughly.

09:31.008 --> 09:32.600
No need to stay too long.

09:32.643 --> 09:34.577
- Let's go, Neptune.
- Right.

09:36.981 --> 09:38.812
I won't let you escape.

09:42.620 --> 09:43.985
Senishenta!

09:44.054 --> 09:46.386
You take care of Sailor
Moon and her entourage!

09:46.423 --> 09:48.050
Yes-SHENTA!

09:57.468 --> 09:58.765
You give me no choice.

09:58.802 --> 10:01.236
If you really want
to settle things...

10:01.272 --> 10:02.830
...we will accept
your challenge!

10:04.108 --> 10:07.737
How long can you keep
up with your wisecracks?

10:17.588 --> 10:19.249
SAILOR KICK!

10:23.027 --> 10:25.188
My arm, my arm!!

10:28.165 --> 10:31.692
"If the merchandise breaks,
we'll replace it with a new one."

10:32.369 --> 10:35.634
Whew! I'm glad
I'm under warranty...

10:36.073 --> 10:38.268
How can you be
so violent-SHENTA?!

10:38.876 --> 10:42.141
You're the violent one!
Special Attack --

10:42.179 --> 10:44.943
LOVE ME MOON CHAIN!!

10:45.949 --> 10:48.782
There's no such attack!

10:49.286 --> 10:50.776
Usagi!

10:50.954 --> 10:52.785
Don't just sit there.
Transform!

10:56.527 --> 11:02.193
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

11:32.996 --> 11:34.258
What?!

11:34.298 --> 11:37.199
So you really were
Sailor Moon-SHENTA?!

11:38.001 --> 11:39.195
That's right!

11:40.104 --> 11:42.231
The one, the only,
the most famous!

11:42.406 --> 11:44.567
Fashionable, attractive, and cool!

11:44.608 --> 11:46.576
The pretty soldier
in a sailor suit!

11:46.610 --> 11:48.237
Sailor Moon!

11:50.147 --> 11:53.446
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!!

11:53.617 --> 11:54.948
Dammit!

12:15.305 --> 12:22.837
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

12:26.283 --> 12:29.411
YOU LIAR!

12:32.990 --> 12:35.584
LOVELY!

12:49.473 --> 12:51.338
Tuxedo Mask!!

12:52.342 --> 12:53.502
I'm so glad!!

12:53.544 --> 12:56.411
Mamo-chan... I'm so glad...

12:57.514 --> 12:58.776
Usako...

12:59.416 --> 13:00.781
Mamo-chan!

13:02.186 --> 13:04.984
Senishenta...!
So, you were defeated!

13:08.559 --> 13:12.051
WORLD SHAKING!

13:23.240 --> 13:24.104
Uranus!

13:24.141 --> 13:25.870
Don't let your
guard down, Neptune.

13:25.909 --> 13:27.433
She's quite powerful!

13:28.645 --> 13:31.205
Hurry over here, Sailor Soldiers!

13:34.885 --> 13:36.216
Up above!

13:36.286 --> 13:39.312
That's right! Everyone, we have
to help those two up there!

13:40.457 --> 13:41.321
Why?!

13:41.391 --> 13:43.859
We should just
leave them be!

13:43.927 --> 13:48.227
We can't! Besides,
they saved me before!!

13:48.298 --> 13:50.289
They're not bad guys!

13:51.468 --> 13:54.232
All right, that's it!
I guess we'll give it our best!

13:54.271 --> 13:56.262
But before that, Venus...

13:57.474 --> 14:00.375
Please, get rid
of that disguise.

14:01.178 --> 14:03.305
Why? Why? Is something
wrong with it?

14:03.580 --> 14:06.606
I borrowed the transformation
pen from Luna and everything!

14:10.687 --> 14:11.415
Dammit!

14:13.357 --> 14:14.585
Hold it right there!

14:15.626 --> 14:17.753
I won't allow you to
blow up the tower...

14:17.794 --> 14:19.853
...that sends happy
fun TV programs...

14:19.897 --> 14:21.694
...to living rooms all
over the country!

14:22.165 --> 14:25.134
In the name of the viewers,
we punish you!

14:25.502 --> 14:27.026
So, you're finally here...

14:28.372 --> 14:31.068
So, now what'll you do?
Run away like usual?

14:32.509 --> 14:36.445
Why do you think I called
you all the way out here?

14:38.949 --> 14:40.177
That shoe!

14:40.217 --> 14:41.343
Listen up.

14:42.286 --> 14:44.379
This is something I
researched on my own...

14:44.421 --> 14:46.446
Growth fluid for Daimohn.

14:46.823 --> 14:48.347
If I combine
these two...

14:49.993 --> 14:52.757
...I get the same power...

14:54.464 --> 14:55.863
...as Senishenta!!

14:58.035 --> 14:59.559
Look out!

15:01.872 --> 15:04.102
Seven glass figurines
of the Sailor Soldiers...

15:04.575 --> 15:06.668
I'm sure our professor
will be happy about this.

15:07.945 --> 15:10.209
Uranus! You're wounded!

15:11.515 --> 15:12.743
This is nothing!!

15:12.783 --> 15:15.684
Leave this fight
to us and run!

15:15.719 --> 15:17.186
What...?!

15:17.821 --> 15:19.880
Now, now... What's wrong?

15:19.957 --> 15:22.687
Where's the fun if you
stand there and do nothing?!

15:26.997 --> 15:28.760
Hurry! Run away!

15:28.799 --> 15:30.596
Do as she says!

15:30.634 --> 15:32.693
Since you couldn't
find the talisman...

15:32.736 --> 15:34.601
...you have no reason
to stay here, right?

15:36.039 --> 15:37.597
That's true...

15:39.409 --> 15:41.070
Let's go, Neptune...

15:41.111 --> 15:44.672
They're saying that they'll
sacrifice themselves for us.

15:44.715 --> 15:47.081
We should take them
up on their offer.

15:48.719 --> 15:50.619
I thought I said I won't
let you escape!

15:54.591 --> 15:58.220
Now you have nowhere left
to run. Are you ready now?

15:58.762 --> 16:00.320
We will never...

16:00.731 --> 16:02.426
...give up!

16:02.933 --> 16:09.361
BURNING MANDALA!

16:10.674 --> 16:13.199
SUPREME THUNDER!

16:17.347 --> 16:19.110
Impossible...!

16:19.316 --> 16:23.753
She has a strong shield
around herself as well!

16:24.788 --> 16:27.552
It's dangerous if we stay
in one place! Split up!

16:27.891 --> 16:29.586
No! We shouldn't separate!!

16:30.594 --> 16:32.619
Do you have a plan?!

16:32.663 --> 16:34.688
The only way for us to
break through that shield...

16:34.731 --> 16:36.790
...is to use the
Sailor Planet Attack!

16:36.833 --> 16:40.735
Impossible! She'll get us
while we're powering up!!

16:41.571 --> 16:42.970
You're finished!

16:46.543 --> 16:48.272
Tuxedo Mask!!

16:48.311 --> 16:51.678
Kaorinite!
I am your opponent!

16:51.748 --> 16:53.113
Come on!

16:53.150 --> 16:54.674
Mamo-chan....!!

17:03.860 --> 17:06.454
MOON COSMIC POWER...!

17:06.897 --> 17:08.626
MARS STAR POWER...!

17:08.665 --> 17:10.223
MERCURY STAR POWER...!

17:11.468 --> 17:13.459
JUPITER STAR POWER...!

17:13.503 --> 17:15.494
VENUS STAR POWER...!

17:15.572 --> 17:17.335
I've got you now!

17:20.844 --> 17:22.072
NOW!

17:22.112 --> 17:24.546
SAILOR PLANET...

17:27.984 --> 17:29.815
...ATTACK!!

17:31.088 --> 17:32.248
What?!

17:41.064 --> 17:43.123
D-Did we get her...?!

17:46.703 --> 17:50.002
It looks like you just
used up all of your powers.

17:50.207 --> 17:51.834
This can't be...!

17:54.945 --> 17:57.675
The people doing the stepping
might be fine with that...

17:57.748 --> 18:00.979
...but what about the people
who are getting stepped on?!

18:02.519 --> 18:04.282
If we all joined forces...

18:04.354 --> 18:08.415
...we'd be able to find a way
to avoid sacrificing anyone!

18:09.359 --> 18:10.986
DIE!

18:15.265 --> 18:18.962
WORLD SHAKING!

18:25.208 --> 18:27.073
What?!

18:31.648 --> 18:33.616
This can't be...happening...!

18:34.584 --> 18:36.347
PROFESSOR!!!

18:50.200 --> 18:52.168
- We did it...
- Yeah...

18:53.603 --> 18:56.163
Where's Uranus and Neptune?!

18:56.406 --> 19:00.809
Those two... Why, in the very,
very end did they save us?

19:05.749 --> 19:08.775
Really... What kind
of a whim was that?

19:09.152 --> 19:11.279
Don't make so
much fun of me.

19:12.656 --> 19:15.648
For some reason,
I thought Sailor Moon...

19:15.692 --> 19:18.058
...looked like buns-head.

19:24.634 --> 19:28.070
Usako... I'm sorry
that your gift is gone.

19:28.405 --> 19:30.202
No, it's all right...

19:30.273 --> 19:33.674
I'm sorry I put you in
danger because of me.

19:33.710 --> 19:39.080
And I always get a lot of love
from you anyway, Mamo-chan!!

19:40.150 --> 19:44.143
Man, talk about setting up a
mood in someone else's house!

19:44.187 --> 19:46.178
I tried so hard, too!

19:46.957 --> 19:49.323
Really, this
bunch of girls...

19:49.359 --> 19:51.350
They really don't
mesh together.

19:51.394 --> 19:54.488
Hey, are you listening?!
Come on, we aren't an inn!!

19:54.531 --> 19:56.590
If you're going to be all
cuddly-snuggly, go home!

19:56.633 --> 19:57.861
I'm hungry!

20:01.771 --> 20:03.762
It's me.

20:05.542 --> 20:09.137
I see. Kaorinite has been...

20:13.216 --> 20:18.017
Then I want you to
take over her task.

20:19.356 --> 20:23.554
You are my only hope, Yujial.

20:26.554 --> 20:30.554
