WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.991
The moon whispers in the breeze.

00:04.035 --> 00:06.333
A waltz drifts in the air
of the mansion of roses.

00:06.371 --> 00:11.104
And a song of hope for the future,
sung in a high voice by a Daimohn...

00:11.142 --> 00:12.905
Hey, wait a minute!

00:12.944 --> 00:15.105
That's not a waltz at all!

00:15.146 --> 00:17.376
You're just singing a strange yodel!

00:17.415 --> 00:20.213
The rhythm of a waltz
is un-deux-trois!

00:21.600 --> 00:23.320
An afternoon in the late summer heat.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.130
In your nicely air-conditioned room...

00:26.170 --> 00:30.500
...the happiness as I
have a romantic daydream.

00:32.370 --> 00:33.430
USAGI!!

00:33.470 --> 00:36.410
It's no time to be daydreaming!

00:36.810 --> 00:38.470
Sheesh, Usagi. You're so...

00:38.510 --> 00:40.140
You have to keep yourself together.

00:40.180 --> 00:42.550
You said you wanted me to tutor you...

00:42.580 --> 00:44.710
Let me guess, the air conditioning
was what you were after?

00:44.750 --> 00:45.840
No, not at all...

00:45.890 --> 00:49.150
The herb tea is delicious too... Oh...

00:49.190 --> 00:51.050
Thanks for the compliments...

00:51.560 --> 00:53.120
Ami, what are you doing?

00:53.160 --> 00:54.460
Did you find an interesting book?

00:54.490 --> 00:57.990
Yes... all academic books
of very high caliber.

00:58.030 --> 01:00.300
Basic Dictionary of
Ancient Babylonian Language.

01:00.330 --> 01:02.730
Fluid Mechanics and Wave Mechanics.

01:02.770 --> 01:05.430
Computer Programming Languages
and Symbolic Logic.

01:05.470 --> 01:08.310
You Can Make Your Own Curry
Dishes from Around the World.

01:08.340 --> 01:11.570
But, these subjects
don't seem very consistent...

01:11.910 --> 01:14.140
All of them are really interesting.

01:14.180 --> 01:17.580
I just can't bring myself to
specifying any one field as my major.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.550
Wow, that's amazing!

01:19.590 --> 01:22.580
Wouldn't you say that you're a jack of
all trades but a master of none?

01:22.620 --> 01:26.580
Just for reference...
That's not really a compliment.

01:27.260 --> 01:30.160
You guys really DO need
to study some more.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.360
Well, we'll start
with the English readers.

01:33.630 --> 01:36.120
I'm terrible at English!

01:36.170 --> 01:38.470
In your case, Usako... you're
terrible at English AS WELL, right?

01:38.510 --> 01:40.700
Hey, someone's here!
Coming, coming!

01:51.180 --> 01:54.240
U-Uh... We're fine if
you're selling newspapers...

01:58.360 --> 02:00.620
I AM... ...English...

02:00.660 --> 02:02.250
...NO, NO, CAN'T... ...see?

02:09.300 --> 02:11.830
Young lady, is Mamoru around?

02:13.070 --> 02:17.100
M-Mamoru... ...IS...
...here, that he is...

02:17.840 --> 02:20.750
Oh, man!
You can speak Japanese!

02:20.780 --> 02:22.610
Edwards!

02:23.020 --> 02:25.580
Hello, Mamoru. Long time no see.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.610
Hello, young ladies.

02:33.990 --> 02:36.460
Mako-chan, I don't
think that's quite it...

02:36.500 --> 02:37.360
I was afraid of that.

02:37.830 --> 02:39.530
If you'd like,
you can have some tea...

02:39.570 --> 02:40.930
No, don't mind me.

02:40.970 --> 02:44.960
Actually, a group of youngsters are
coming over to my place again today.

02:45.010 --> 02:47.870
They told me to invite
you to the gathering.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.140
Thanks for coming all
the way out here...

02:50.680 --> 02:52.580
Oh, I just came here as
part of my daily walk.

02:52.610 --> 02:56.070
Oh, yes, if they would like to come,
the young ladies are also invited.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.670
It's a very fun party.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.780
Party!!?

03:09.260 --> 03:11.250
Edwards is an English
gentleman who lives...

03:11.300 --> 03:13.290
...in the European mansion
on the outskirts of town.

03:14.630 --> 03:17.800
So he's the much-rumored English gentleman
who lives in that European mansion!

03:18.270 --> 03:18.930
Yeah.

03:18.970 --> 03:21.240
Edwards often invites
young exchange students...

03:21.270 --> 03:23.540
...to his mansion,
and holds parties for them.

03:23.880 --> 03:27.180
The mansion on top of the hill...
The graceful melodies of a waltz...

03:27.210 --> 03:29.110
It's wonderful that you
can communicate between...

03:29.150 --> 03:31.050
...cultures with people
from various countries.

03:31.450 --> 03:34.350
In a wonderful European mansion...
a party with Mamo-chan!

03:34.390 --> 03:36.820
Starting today,
I too am a global person!

03:36.860 --> 03:40.160
But... the fact that it's
a party for exchange students...

03:40.190 --> 03:41.660
Yeah. Most of the
conversation is in English.

03:41.660 --> 03:42.820
ENGLISH
Yeah. Most of the
conversation is in English.

03:43.260 --> 03:46.100
So, in order for you not
to be embarrassed at the party...

03:46.130 --> 03:47.160
...let's brush up your English skills.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.370
Party with Mamo-chan...

03:49.400 --> 03:51.100
ENGLISH
But in English.

03:51.610 --> 03:54.100
T-That's why we're going to
go over English now, right?

03:54.140 --> 03:56.070
Party with Mamo-chan...

03:56.110 --> 03:58.100
ENGLISH
But in English.

03:58.140 --> 04:01.110
Hello? Usako?

04:01.480 --> 04:03.640
I guess we're calling it a day now...

04:03.680 --> 04:06.880
We couldn't study at all again today...

04:10.120 --> 04:12.280
The elegant melody of the waltz.

04:12.330 --> 04:14.290
The three-beat rhythm represents...

04:14.330 --> 04:16.850
...intelligence, education,
and the will to fight.

04:16.900 --> 04:21.390
It is the ultimate music that
represents us, the Death Busters.

04:21.430 --> 04:23.460
Excuse me a moment...

04:24.170 --> 04:27.110
The song title is
""Hope for the Future.""

04:27.140 --> 04:29.470
It's a piece I composed
when I was young.

04:30.010 --> 04:30.870
In other words...

04:30.910 --> 04:33.170
This time, we're
targeting someone with...

04:33.210 --> 04:35.480
...a pure heart that fits
the images of a waltz well.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.980
Yes... and the "Hope
for the Future" as well.

04:39.390 --> 04:40.410
Yes...

04:40.450 --> 04:42.720
An owner of a pure heart
who loves a waltz...

04:42.760 --> 04:44.990
...and is passionate about
hope for the future.

04:45.190 --> 04:47.520
Gloria!

04:52.830 --> 04:57.360
I-I didn't know that
this was a waltz at all...

04:57.900 --> 04:59.000
P-Professor!?

04:59.210 --> 05:00.140
Professor!?

05:00.170 --> 05:01.000
Professor!?

05:02.440 --> 05:04.970
Sheesh, what part of that was a waltz!?

05:05.010 --> 05:06.740
Boy, I have a bad feeling about this...

05:31.270 --> 05:34.570
Chiquon!

05:58.260 --> 05:59.130
You're kidding!

06:06.170 --> 06:08.140
W-What was that!?

06:14.380 --> 06:17.350
Wow, lots of handsome guys!

06:17.380 --> 06:19.150
Lots of tall people!

06:20.220 --> 06:23.050
They really ARE talking in English!!

06:23.090 --> 06:25.420
Usagi, love has no boundaries!!

06:25.460 --> 06:26.720
The one who talks wins!

06:26.760 --> 06:28.590
You say that, but...

06:28.630 --> 06:32.660
Usagi, this is a chance to
really use English! Try your best!

06:32.930 --> 06:36.160
I haven't studied enough to
think that this is a chance!

06:42.340 --> 06:43.600
L-LONG TIE...

06:46.750 --> 06:48.010
T-They're coming!!

06:50.620 --> 06:55.990
Mamoru, please hurry up and introduce
us to these lovely young ladies.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.680
They are... very good at Japanese.

06:58.730 --> 07:01.920
We do attend a Japanese university.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.830
We lucked out, Usagi.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.160
Where's Usagi?

07:06.200 --> 07:07.860
Maybe in the bathroom?

07:07.900 --> 07:09.030
H-HOW... ARE... YOU...

07:09.070 --> 07:11.500
NICE...? NICE TO...?

07:11.540 --> 07:13.200
MEAT... No, not that...

07:13.240 --> 07:15.940
...MEET YOU...

07:16.740 --> 07:18.370
Everyone is so amazing!

07:18.410 --> 07:20.350
Even Rei and Mako-chan
are speaking in English...

07:20.380 --> 07:23.710
Well, for now, I'll drink
some juice and calm down.

07:26.020 --> 07:30.290
Mamoru, you should pursue theoretical
physics. It's a wonderful field.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.420
George, you shouldn't force
your likes on others...

07:33.460 --> 07:34.950
What are you studying, Ned?

07:35.560 --> 07:39.760
They all study very
advanced subjects...

07:39.800 --> 07:42.360
They are reliable young individuals.

07:42.400 --> 07:47.970
It's my pleasure to provide this mansion
as a place for them to socialize.

07:48.310 --> 07:51.800
A beautiful waltz, and young individuals
who are full of possibilities.

07:51.850 --> 07:56.180
Life is rosy when you have those
two things. That is what I believe.

07:56.220 --> 07:57.580
That's amazing...

07:57.620 --> 08:01.990
I think I can see that rosy future.

08:02.220 --> 08:05.280
I want you to become one of those
people who create that rosy future.

08:05.330 --> 08:06.490
Yes, I will do my best.

08:06.760 --> 08:07.620
All too amazing.

08:07.660 --> 08:10.690
The conversation level is
so high, I can't keep up.

08:10.730 --> 08:13.320
Ami really IS a genius.

08:13.370 --> 08:15.600
Hey, Mamo-chan!

08:15.640 --> 08:16.500
Usagi?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.670
The pudding of relativity?
Let's see...

08:19.710 --> 08:24.640
Well, in other words, you take eggs,
milk, and sugar, and you stir it all up.

08:24.680 --> 08:29.140
Then you put a lid on it, and for
about 30 minutes you steam it...

08:29.180 --> 08:32.670
Oh! If you forget the whipped cream,
you're no good as a woman. Yeah.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.350
Interesting... to make a metaphor out of
the theory of relativity and pudding...

08:36.390 --> 08:38.690
That's a pretty unique perspective.

08:38.730 --> 08:42.320
Oh, mister, you're speaking Japanese!

08:42.360 --> 08:45.850
You're such an Edo kid!
Have some sushi, yeah!

08:46.200 --> 08:47.060
U-Usako?

08:47.100 --> 08:50.930
Now, Mamo-chan, you too.
About international socialization...

08:50.970 --> 08:52.370
Make it flamboyant!

08:52.770 --> 08:54.970
Usagi, you are an individualist.

08:55.010 --> 08:58.710
Well... NICE TO MEET YOU, CREAM STEW!

08:58.750 --> 09:00.740
She's drunk.

09:01.350 --> 09:04.370
DON'T WORRY... Big bowl, curry!

09:04.780 --> 09:06.680
Lady, if you could come over here...

09:06.720 --> 09:08.950
SEE YOU AGAIN!
I won't give you anything!

09:08.990 --> 09:11.550
Mamoru, escort the young
lady over to the balcony...

09:11.590 --> 09:13.420
Right...

09:13.460 --> 09:17.620
Everyone, we have invited
two new guests tonight.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.890
Please direct your
attention to the stage.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.400
Miss Haruka Tenoh and
Miss Michiru Kaioh.

09:23.570 --> 09:24.500
Haruka!?

09:24.540 --> 09:25.830
Michiru, too!

09:25.870 --> 09:28.430
Everyone, listen...

09:28.470 --> 09:29.410
Usagi is...?

09:32.550 --> 09:33.770
Here, have some water.

09:33.810 --> 09:35.510
How did she drink booze--

09:35.550 --> 09:37.850
I didn't drink booze at all...

09:37.880 --> 09:43.550
I drank some juice. Like this...
Just like this...

09:43.590 --> 09:45.420
- Usagi, wait a minute!
- Usagi, pull yourself together!

10:01.210 --> 10:02.700
Show time.

10:04.210 --> 10:06.140
Are you all right, Usagi?

10:06.180 --> 10:06.980
Somehow...

10:07.010 --> 10:07.910
Hello, girls.

10:07.950 --> 10:08.680
Good evening.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.700
Haruka.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.810
This is a wonderful party.

10:11.850 --> 10:13.410
A waltz just started.

10:13.450 --> 10:15.550
Mamoru, would you care
to join me in a dance?

10:15.590 --> 10:17.820
No! Mamo-chan's dancing with ME...

10:17.860 --> 10:21.990
Oh, my... then buns-head
can dance with me.

10:22.030 --> 10:24.000
Yes, gladly!

10:27.600 --> 10:30.760
That's it... You're pretty good.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.830
Yes... it's just like
I'm having a dream.

10:35.210 --> 10:36.540
Usagi is...

10:36.580 --> 10:37.870
...dancing.

10:37.910 --> 10:40.040
It's thanks to Haruka's lead.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.010
I'm jealous...
I want the next dance...

10:42.050 --> 10:44.780
All right! We'll arm-wrestle
for who goes next!

10:44.820 --> 10:47.380
C-Can we make that
paper-rock-scissors, at least?

10:47.420 --> 10:48.680
G-Guys...

10:48.720 --> 10:50.020
Ready, set...

10:50.260 --> 10:52.690
The master of this mansion
apparently helps...

10:52.730 --> 10:55.630
...young individuals,
and he never holds out.

10:55.660 --> 11:00.160
When he was young, Edwards gained his
wealth by stomping on top of other people.

11:00.200 --> 11:04.360
He'd firmly believed that money was what
you needed to build a brighter future.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.130
However, he realized something one day.

11:07.170 --> 11:09.970
Without family or friends,
he was all alone.

11:10.010 --> 11:13.040
He wondered who he could
entrust the rosy future to...

11:13.310 --> 11:15.280
Rosy future?

11:15.310 --> 11:17.010
He's a romantic person, isn't he?

11:17.050 --> 11:21.540
A future is something that you need
to pay a huge sacrifice to attain.

11:22.020 --> 11:24.790
Even a future that you get
by paying many sacrifices...

11:24.820 --> 11:27.550
...means nothing if there
is nobody to look after it.

11:28.130 --> 11:30.650
It's impossible to
do that by yourself...

11:30.700 --> 11:32.390
Ready, set, toss!

11:32.430 --> 11:34.260
Tie, set, toss!

11:34.300 --> 11:35.960
Tie, set, toss!

11:36.000 --> 11:38.600
Tie, set, toss!

11:38.640 --> 11:41.400
- Hey, Rei put her hand in a bit late!
- Hey, I haven't done such a thing!

11:41.440 --> 11:44.000
- Sure you did!
- Did not!

12:07.600 --> 12:09.300
Oh, tres bien!

12:09.340 --> 12:10.320
Khorosho!

12:10.370 --> 12:11.530
What a fitting couple!

12:12.910 --> 12:14.870
U-Um...

12:14.910 --> 12:17.810
Can I ask for... the next dance?

12:17.840 --> 12:20.110
Hey, that's not fair.
I would like the next dance...

12:20.150 --> 12:21.700
Young lady, I would
like the next dance...

12:21.750 --> 12:23.740
No, with me...

12:25.890 --> 12:28.620
U-Um, hello...?

12:29.360 --> 12:32.650
Oh, boy, the next
dance already started.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.760
Hey, Mako-chan, guys...
What are all of you doing?

12:37.800 --> 12:40.630
Hey, Mamo-chan...

12:40.970 --> 12:42.660
H-Haruka...

12:42.700 --> 12:43.930
I-Impossible!

12:43.970 --> 12:45.300
What in the world...

12:45.340 --> 12:47.860
...have we been doing?

12:47.910 --> 12:49.340
Young ladies...

12:49.580 --> 12:52.200
Dancing is a fine thing,
but how about something else?

12:52.250 --> 12:54.610
Can I ask you to join
me for a little while?

12:55.150 --> 12:57.550
I can show you a very special place.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.610
A special place?

13:00.950 --> 13:03.290
Wow, this is beautiful!

13:03.320 --> 13:05.120
How beautiful!

13:05.160 --> 13:07.630
Hey, that area must
be the Juban district.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.290
I feel like I'm in some dream!

13:10.330 --> 13:12.420
I take it that you
are satisfied with this?

13:12.470 --> 13:14.630
Yes! It truly is wonderful!

13:14.670 --> 13:16.230
Thank you very much.

13:16.270 --> 13:22.000
My dream is that young individuals
nurture a beautiful future...

13:22.040 --> 13:24.310
...much like the
flowers in this garden.

13:24.340 --> 13:27.280
I am looking forward to
all of your futures as well.

13:28.250 --> 13:31.310
Well, I will have drinks
and some cake brought out now.

13:31.350 --> 13:33.250
Yippee!

13:33.290 --> 13:34.150
U-Usagi...

13:35.490 --> 13:38.150
To make such beautiful flowers bloom...

13:38.190 --> 13:41.460
Mr. Edwards is such
a kindhearted person.

13:41.490 --> 13:46.120
A waltz, young people full of hope,
and Mr. Edwards' pure heart...

13:46.170 --> 13:49.660
It's just as though this mansion
is filled with a rosy future...

13:59.310 --> 14:00.840
No! Don't open that door!

14:09.260 --> 14:10.350
Oh, no!

14:10.860 --> 14:12.320
W-What in the world is this?

14:14.130 --> 14:15.060
Y-Young lady...

14:15.530 --> 14:18.050
Hurry outside!
Young lady?

14:24.300 --> 14:25.430
Edwards!

14:25.840 --> 14:27.270
Captured!!

14:36.880 --> 14:39.040
Well, you do want to
choose your own cake.

14:39.090 --> 14:40.850
What is this smoke!?

14:43.620 --> 14:45.250
This one looks very likely...

14:46.190 --> 14:48.820
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

14:48.860 --> 14:51.260
MAKE UP!

15:04.610 --> 15:07.010
URANUS PLANET POWER...

15:07.050 --> 15:09.450
MAKE UP!

15:25.200 --> 15:27.790
DEEP...

15:27.830 --> 15:30.430
...SUBMERGE!

15:35.110 --> 15:37.300
We can't let you take this.

15:37.340 --> 15:39.040
Daimohn!!

15:39.080 --> 15:42.340
Backing up, backing up...

15:43.150 --> 15:45.950
Appear, Daimohn!

15:52.690 --> 15:54.020
Daimohn?

15:54.060 --> 15:55.990
Hey, what are you doing!?

15:56.230 --> 15:57.700
T-The dress is...

15:57.730 --> 15:59.720
...heavy...

16:00.370 --> 16:02.560
Oh, I have a headache...

16:02.600 --> 16:04.470
I want to go home now...

16:04.500 --> 16:05.990
Not so fast!

16:08.440 --> 16:10.970
The bell for midnight
hasn't struck yet!

16:11.010 --> 16:13.240
If you're already saying
that you're going home, you...

16:13.280 --> 16:15.340
...definitely aren't Cinderella.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.680
An intruder, an uninvited one!

16:17.720 --> 16:22.310
The witch in Sleeping Beauty,
the evil lord in Swan Lake...

16:22.360 --> 16:25.450
Villains who disrupt
parties are always defeated!

16:25.690 --> 16:29.630
Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty,
Princess Odette, and... ur...

16:29.660 --> 16:32.650
In the name of all the others!

16:32.700 --> 16:34.190
We'll punish you!

16:35.230 --> 16:37.200
Another cause for a headache!

16:37.500 --> 16:39.900
This isn't a talisman.

16:39.940 --> 16:41.370
There you have it.

16:41.410 --> 16:43.000
It was a wasted trip, Eugeal.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.770
So my bad feeling was right!

16:45.810 --> 16:47.010
Chiquon!

16:47.580 --> 16:48.670
Chiquon!

16:49.720 --> 16:52.580
So, I'm leaving the rest for you!

16:53.190 --> 16:54.520
Chiquon!

16:55.960 --> 16:58.720
UN DEUX TROIS!

17:01.190 --> 17:03.320
UN DEUX TROIS!

17:06.100 --> 17:06.930
Sailor Moon!

17:10.470 --> 17:11.440
Chiquon!

17:12.710 --> 17:13.690
I can't stand to watch this.

17:16.740 --> 17:19.010
WORLD...

17:19.040 --> 17:21.210
...SHAKING!

17:30.790 --> 17:31.920
Uranus!

17:31.960 --> 17:34.520
Whoops, was that unnecessary?

17:34.560 --> 17:36.290
How do you do?

17:36.960 --> 17:38.360
Chiquon!

17:38.400 --> 17:39.520
Oh, it hasn't been defeated yet!

17:39.570 --> 17:40.550
It's rather persistent!

17:41.900 --> 17:42.800
Chiquon!

17:44.370 --> 17:49.240
Hell's Waltz!

17:52.210 --> 17:53.510
What in the world is this!?

17:53.550 --> 17:55.910
What is this!?
Even if you throw musical notes...

17:58.920 --> 18:00.650
This is totally unfair!

18:00.690 --> 18:04.450
If you're a record player, why can't you
fight using music like a record player!?

18:04.490 --> 18:05.290
Sheesh!

18:05.960 --> 18:07.820
You have a good point there.

18:07.860 --> 18:08.690
In that case...

18:08.730 --> 18:11.560
A brand-new composition that
I just finished right now!

18:12.030 --> 18:15.060
The Devil's Yodel!

18:20.470 --> 18:21.960
It hurts!

18:22.010 --> 18:23.800
W-What is with this sound!?

18:24.780 --> 18:28.800
This sound stimulates and destroys
the central nervous system of people!

18:33.190 --> 18:34.170
Who is it!?

18:35.960 --> 18:38.250
The sound of music is
meant to be appreciated!

18:38.290 --> 18:40.690
It is not something to
give pain to other people!

18:40.730 --> 18:42.460
Tuxedo Mask!

18:42.730 --> 18:46.190
I will not forgive anyone
who defiles beautiful music!

18:49.870 --> 18:51.770
Oh, no, my last weapon!

18:52.070 --> 18:53.770
Now, Sailor Moon!

18:54.170 --> 18:54.760
Okay!

19:15.030 --> 19:18.930
MOON SPIRAL...

19:18.960 --> 19:21.990
...HEART...

19:22.030 --> 19:24.530
...ATTACK!

19:27.070 --> 19:30.800
I shouldn't have thrown away the bell!

19:33.780 --> 19:37.770
LOVELY!

19:54.300 --> 19:57.130
Did I fall asleep or something?

19:57.170 --> 20:00.230
Oh? I didn't notice anything...

20:00.270 --> 20:02.370
Oh, man, they look so happy...

20:02.410 --> 20:04.070
I'm jealous...

20:04.110 --> 20:07.010
Oh, yeah, where's Haruka?
I have to ask her for a dance!

20:07.050 --> 20:08.780
All right!
We can play rock-paper-scissors again!

20:08.810 --> 20:10.010
- All right!
- Y-You guys...

20:11.780 --> 20:15.520
Believing only in a rosy future, and
entrusting that dream to the next generation.

20:15.550 --> 20:18.020
I guess that's one way to live.

20:18.060 --> 20:23.190
But we have no time left. The silence
of this world is quickly approaching.

20:23.230 --> 20:27.820
To prevent that from happening, we
must hurry up and find the talismans...

20:30.820 --> 20:34.820
