00:02.382 --> 00:06.148
Ami, you've been weird lately.
Something worrying you?

00:06.186 --> 00:08.211
Hey, you can talk to
me about anything.

00:08.255 --> 00:12.453
Perhaps a clumsy girl
like me can't do much...

00:12.492 --> 00:14.983
...but I'll do
everything I can.

00:15.028 --> 00:17.792
Bad kids who make fun
of my precious friends...

00:17.864 --> 00:20.162
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

00:26.000 --> 00:27.433
Oh, Mizuno.

00:27.468 --> 00:28.992
Yes?

00:29.037 --> 00:31.301
This was in the
audio/video room.

00:31.339 --> 00:33.239
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:33.274 --> 00:36.402
It's unlike you to forget
a guidebook somewhere.

00:36.444 --> 00:38.639
Is something bothering you?

00:38.680 --> 00:40.671
Oh, no, not really.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.509
This year is finally the
year of the entrance exams.

00:43.584 --> 00:46.075
I have high hopes for you.
Do your best.

00:47.322 --> 00:49.085
Oh, Ami.

00:49.123 --> 00:51.091
I heard rumors
that you've been...

00:51.125 --> 00:54.458
...taking care of
delinquent students lately.

00:57.498 --> 00:59.864
I hope they aren't getting
in the way of your studies.

01:03.838 --> 01:05.863
If you ever feel like they're
dragging you down...

01:09.143 --> 01:11.805
...you can come talk to
me about it at any time.

01:11.846 --> 01:13.507
Even for you,
vice-principal...

01:13.548 --> 01:15.948
...I don't think "dragging me
down" is a good thing to say.

01:15.984 --> 01:17.975
Oh, no! That's just
a play on words.

01:18.019 --> 01:21.682
Well, I just want you to
concentrate on your academics.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.852
I'll see you around.

01:24.359 --> 01:26.190
Dragging her down...

01:26.227 --> 01:28.661
I guess that's true.

01:28.896 --> 01:30.488
Hey, I finally found you!

01:30.531 --> 01:31.896
Oh, Naru.

01:31.933 --> 01:34.731
You promised you'd buy me pizza
for letting you copy my homework.

01:34.769 --> 01:37.237
I won't let you say that
you've already forgotten.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.795
Oh, was that the case?

01:38.873 --> 01:40.841
Umino's share, too.

01:47.315 --> 01:50.148
Only on my academics...

02:09.837 --> 02:10.769
Hey.

02:10.805 --> 02:12.568
Mamoru...

02:12.607 --> 02:15.542
What's the matter?
You look dazed there.

02:15.843 --> 02:18.107
Something worrying you?

02:18.479 --> 02:20.879
That's not like
you somehow...

02:20.915 --> 02:22.815
Mamoru...

02:22.850 --> 02:26.843
What do you think is left of
me if you took academics away?

02:26.888 --> 02:29.186
Huh? What do you mean?

02:29.257 --> 02:32.624
I'm sorry for asking
such a strange question.

02:32.660 --> 02:35.288
But, I've been
thinking lately...

02:35.329 --> 02:37.991
My mother is a doctor,
so I decided at an early age...

02:38.066 --> 02:40.125
...that I wanted to
become a doctor myself.

02:40.168 --> 02:43.763
And I've been studying without
a doubt to become one.

02:44.405 --> 02:48.637
I thought that becoming a good
doctor was my dream, but...

02:49.577 --> 02:51.408
It's not?

02:51.446 --> 02:54.938
I've been feeling that I
really have no dream at all.

02:54.982 --> 02:56.449
Why?

02:56.484 --> 02:59.647
I think becoming a good
doctor is a wonderful dream.

03:00.721 --> 03:04.987
But people with real
dreams shine brighter.

03:05.927 --> 03:07.792
Usagi, for example,
is full of dreams...

03:07.862 --> 03:12.026
She shines so brightly
that I can't even compare.

03:12.066 --> 03:15.661
True, she does have more than
the average amount of dreams.

03:15.703 --> 03:17.694
The only thing I
have is academics.

03:17.738 --> 03:20.764
Maybe I can't become
a good doctor like that.

03:22.877 --> 03:25.675
But that's a shame.

03:25.713 --> 03:27.806
If it's a cute doctor like you...

03:27.849 --> 03:31.649
...I was thinking that I could
bear getting a shot or two.

03:31.686 --> 03:34.553
Mamoru, you dislike
getting shots?

03:36.023 --> 03:37.991
I hate it.

03:38.426 --> 03:41.418
- Is that funny?
- Yes, it's funny.

03:41.462 --> 03:43.327
You think so?

03:45.733 --> 03:49.134
Thank you. I feel a
little bit better now.

03:49.170 --> 03:52.333
That's good. Is the study
group about to begin?

03:52.373 --> 03:53.533
Yes...

03:53.574 --> 03:56.668
Oh, but I'm going to go swim in
the pool for a bit before that.

03:56.744 --> 03:57.676
See you.

03:57.712 --> 03:58.974
Yeah.

04:00.715 --> 04:04.082
You shine enough
just the way you are.

04:07.321 --> 04:10.051
That is the famous
genius girl...

04:10.424 --> 04:13.621
Then she must have a pure
heart full of confidence...

04:13.661 --> 04:16.528
...and skills that shine.

04:32.346 --> 04:36.442
Nobody's here.
Like it's reserved just for me.

04:55.937 --> 04:58.235
She swims so vibrantly.

05:11.652 --> 05:13.313
Beautiful...

05:18.659 --> 05:20.126
Hello.

05:20.161 --> 05:24.791
You came from a world of
water in your past life as well.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.761
I don't know...

05:35.042 --> 05:37.067
Let's have a race.

05:37.878 --> 05:39.436
Ready...

05:39.780 --> 05:41.771
- To the other side.
- Sure.

05:41.849 --> 05:43.407
Go!

05:50.358 --> 05:51.655
She's fast!

06:10.645 --> 06:12.442
A tie.

06:17.485 --> 06:18.452
Um...

06:25.359 --> 06:27.725
Why did you slow down?

06:29.430 --> 06:32.126
Were you trying to
make me feel better?

06:32.166 --> 06:35.829
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way...

06:36.904 --> 06:38.633
I'm sorry!

06:41.609 --> 06:42.439
Oh?

06:42.476 --> 06:44.967
Oh, boy, you made her cry.

06:45.046 --> 06:46.411
I didn't mean to...

06:46.447 --> 06:48.938
She just wanted
to be friends.

06:49.383 --> 06:51.681
Since she's the type that
isn't confident in herself...

06:51.752 --> 06:54.220
...she unconsciously avoided
a confrontation.

06:54.255 --> 06:56.086
And you made fun of that.

06:56.123 --> 06:57.750
I just wanted to say that...

06:57.792 --> 07:00.659
...I wanted to race her
with all of our strength.

07:01.829 --> 07:03.160
Sheesh...

07:03.764 --> 07:07.723
Still, I feel sorry
for her like this.

07:14.141 --> 07:16.871
I'm good for nothing...

07:22.183 --> 07:24.651
What did this
proverb mean again?

07:24.685 --> 07:26.585
Oh, I know, I know.

07:26.620 --> 07:30.989
It's something about Fukusuke
coming back for O-bon or not.

07:31.025 --> 07:32.959
You mean, "spilt water never
comes back to the bon (tray)."

07:32.993 --> 07:34.927
Oh, yeah, that one!

07:35.296 --> 07:37.526
Hey, Ami, about this one?!

07:37.565 --> 07:39.590
- The special-case verbs that start with k!
- Does a related object mean...

07:41.102 --> 07:45.402
Guys! Studying should be
done with your own abilities!

07:45.806 --> 07:47.330
Usagi is...

07:47.408 --> 07:49.535
...saying something decent!

07:49.577 --> 07:51.909
Do you want me to
take your temperature?

07:53.080 --> 07:54.445
WHY!?

07:54.482 --> 07:56.712
Usagi, it's all right.

07:56.751 --> 07:58.981
Everyone should keep
asking the questions.

07:59.019 --> 08:01.180
A no is a no!

08:02.089 --> 08:07.288
Ami has to study more and
more to become a doctor!

08:07.528 --> 08:09.519
She's not like us!

08:09.563 --> 08:14.000
From now on, I, Usagi, will not
allow anyone to get in her way!

08:14.835 --> 08:15.802
Usagi!

08:15.836 --> 08:17.929
It's all right, so don't
worry about it!

08:17.972 --> 08:21.339
Ami, you just have to study!

08:21.375 --> 08:22.967
Just study...?

08:25.479 --> 08:27.208
That's true...

08:27.848 --> 08:29.782
Thanks, Usagi.

08:29.850 --> 08:33.308
Oh, but I forgot
something. I'll go get it.

08:33.387 --> 08:34.479
Really?

08:34.555 --> 08:35.487
Yeah.

08:44.732 --> 08:47.064
Usagi's enthusiastic
about studying...

08:47.101 --> 08:48.762
...and Ami forgot something...?

08:48.803 --> 08:50.361
It's the opposite of usual.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.872
Well, let's do
our best studying.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.501
Before Usagi's
enthusiasm fades away.

08:55.543 --> 08:57.010
I forgot something, too!

08:59.413 --> 09:01.813
What is going on?!

09:02.550 --> 09:06.350
What should I do?
Did I say something bad?

09:08.622 --> 09:12.456
Even Usagi told me to
just do academics...

09:14.929 --> 09:18.990
But I really don't
have anything else...

09:20.267 --> 09:21.791
I'm so sick of this.

09:26.373 --> 09:27.397
Hey.

09:29.376 --> 09:32.243
My partner wants a rematch.

09:32.279 --> 09:35.840
Oh, don't run away and
cause me more trouble.

09:35.883 --> 09:38.875
Here, I'll take you
to the sports center.

09:38.919 --> 09:41.149
That's fine. I'll walk there!

09:41.956 --> 09:43.218
Suit yourself...

09:45.493 --> 09:47.461
It's a nice sunset.

09:47.495 --> 09:48.519
You think so?

09:48.596 --> 09:50.996
Is it not that great..?

09:51.031 --> 09:52.464
Oh?

09:54.768 --> 09:56.531
Ami.

09:56.604 --> 09:59.971
Ami should be studying with
everyone else right about now.

10:00.007 --> 10:03.067
- But that really was Ami.
- Hey, Luna!

10:13.721 --> 10:17.657
A new Daimohn egg
has been completed.

10:17.825 --> 10:22.387
Go, in search of a pure heart!

10:56.664 --> 10:59.792
I'm glad you could come,
Miss Ami Mizuno.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.734
Or did Haruka force
you to come over?

11:02.770 --> 11:05.295
I came on my own will.

11:05.339 --> 11:08.604
I'm sorry if I made you feel
bad by what happened earlier.

11:08.642 --> 11:11.042
Or is it that
you're mocking me?

11:12.279 --> 11:14.270
All I want to do
is have a rematch.

11:15.649 --> 11:17.048
I hope you'll accept.

11:18.786 --> 11:21.016
Ami went to
the sports center?

11:21.055 --> 11:22.545
Why?

11:22.590 --> 11:25.388
I don't know, but Luna's
watching over her now.

11:26.493 --> 11:27.824
Let's go there, Artemis.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.658
- All right, then follow me.
- Sure!

11:33.400 --> 11:36.267
I hope nothing
serious happens.

11:36.437 --> 11:38.166
Ami...

11:39.740 --> 11:42.504
100-meter freestyle
should be enough.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.634
Yes.

11:43.677 --> 11:45.076
Ready...

11:59.326 --> 12:00.691
She's fast!

12:00.728 --> 12:03.856
She really is amazing...
But I won't lose!

12:03.897 --> 12:05.797
She's smiling!?

12:13.941 --> 12:15.909
They're even.

12:20.714 --> 12:24.047
I've never met someone
like this before. I might lose.

12:26.587 --> 12:30.455
Why am I putting so much
effort into this right now?

12:30.491 --> 12:32.755
Is it because I
don't want to lose?

12:34.695 --> 12:36.822
No, it's because I
don't want to run away.

12:38.365 --> 12:41.562
If I don't give it everything
here, I'll end up running away...

12:43.070 --> 12:46.506
It's important to not run away
and give it everything I've got!

12:58.385 --> 13:00.182
Tie.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.814
It's a tie.

13:02.856 --> 13:06.724
See? Competing with all your
strength isn't a bad thing, is it?

13:08.462 --> 13:09.895
You're right.

13:20.641 --> 13:22.131
Thank you.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.167
No, thank you.

13:24.211 --> 13:27.374
It was fun.
We should do this again.

13:41.762 --> 13:44.230
I think I'll go for another swim...

14:09.823 --> 14:10.915
Mm-Mm-MON!

14:10.991 --> 14:12.720
What?!

14:13.861 --> 14:15.226
DOVLIN!

14:15.262 --> 14:18.129
I'll take your pure heart...

14:18.165 --> 14:21.328
...that's worried by the
doubts in your life!

14:25.839 --> 14:27.272
DOVUN!

14:35.749 --> 14:39.207
Lane 1, Dovlin!

14:40.587 --> 14:42.214
Here I go!

14:52.800 --> 14:55.200
Usagi! It looks like a
Daimohn's appeared!

14:59.106 --> 15:01.472
- Transform!
- Yeah!

15:03.644 --> 15:08.946
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

15:42.583 --> 15:44.210
Stop that!

15:44.251 --> 15:45.377
DOVUN?

15:45.919 --> 15:48.149
I came here in
search of a friend...

15:48.222 --> 15:50.349
...and something unwanted
is misbehaving!

15:51.491 --> 15:54.722
For love and justice, the
pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

15:54.761 --> 15:56.353
Sailor Moon!

15:57.965 --> 16:01.594
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

16:03.637 --> 16:04.899
Sailor Moon!

16:05.939 --> 16:09.204
Dovlin! Don't flinch!
Just grab the pure heart!

16:09.243 --> 16:10.608
DOVUN!

16:14.314 --> 16:15.246
DOVUN!

16:31.431 --> 16:32.420
Ami!

16:35.002 --> 16:37.163
Hey, give that back!

16:37.204 --> 16:41.300
Ami is kinder than anyone!
And she's smart...!

16:45.646 --> 16:48.638
She's going to become the
best doctor in the world!

16:48.949 --> 16:50.348
And she's my...

16:51.885 --> 16:54.410
My dear friend!

16:59.293 --> 17:01.557
This isn't a talisman either!

17:05.799 --> 17:07.699
I won't forgive anyone...

17:07.734 --> 17:10.794
...who hurts the pure hearts
of innocent maidens!

17:11.338 --> 17:13.101
Tuxedo Mask!

17:14.408 --> 17:17.707
Dovlin, get rid of
these nuisances.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.679
DOVUN!

17:29.723 --> 17:32.021
Good thing I was wearing
a floating ring.

17:37.965 --> 17:39.023
Damn you!

17:42.736 --> 17:44.704
Now, Sailor Moon!

17:44.738 --> 17:45.397
Right!

18:05.959 --> 18:13.889
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

18:24.945 --> 18:28.972
LOVELY!

18:41.661 --> 18:43.060
Ami!

19:07.354 --> 19:08.753
Sailor Moon...

19:09.956 --> 19:11.423
Ami...

19:11.458 --> 19:13.323
Thank you...

19:16.863 --> 19:20.731
It's a shame, but this one
wasn't a talisman, either.

19:20.767 --> 19:23.668
You're glad she's
all right, I bet.

19:25.439 --> 19:27.100
I'm sorry, Ami.

19:27.140 --> 19:29.802
Did I say something that
hurt your feelings?

19:29.876 --> 19:31.810
No, it's not that...

19:31.878 --> 19:34.540
I was just a
little depressed.

19:34.614 --> 19:37.913
But thanks to Sailor Moon,
I think I'll be better now.

19:37.984 --> 19:39.383
Thank you so much.

19:39.419 --> 19:40.818
Oh...

19:40.854 --> 19:42.947
You're welcome.

19:42.989 --> 19:44.354
It looks like you've
gotten over it.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.722
Yes.

19:45.759 --> 19:47.659
I finally understand.

19:47.694 --> 19:50.356
It's important to do something
with everything you have.

19:52.732 --> 19:55.826
To worry is the same
thing as to stop...

19:56.303 --> 19:57.930
So I won't run away.

19:57.971 --> 19:59.734
You know...

19:59.773 --> 20:02.606
Is this what you
call a "good mood"?

20:03.944 --> 20:09.405
Um, Ami, Tuxedo Mask
here is MY Tuxedo Mask!

20:09.449 --> 20:12.577
Oh? I won't
lose there, either!

20:13.053 --> 20:14.816
No, you can't! No, no!

20:14.855 --> 20:17.653
- I won't lose!
- No, no, no!

20:17.691 --> 20:19.318
I won't lose!

20:19.359 --> 20:20.758
No, no, no, NO!

20:20.794 --> 20:25.322
- I won't lose!
- No, no, no, NO!!

20:25.365 --> 20:29.131
Well, we can't do this forever,
so let's go back and study!

20:29.436 --> 20:31.097
D'oh!

20:34.097 --> 20:38.097
