1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,434
What is your dream?

2
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:06,997
No matter how far away it is...

3
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:09,006
...if you have a heart to keep wishing for it...

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,600
...your dreams are bound to come true.

5
00:00:11,643 --> 00:00:15,943
So stop doing evil deeds
and be a true good girl.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,609
If you can, Mimet,
you'll be the star tomorrow!

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,165
Pure hearts...

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:33,670
Hurry up and collect the pure
hearts that will complete me...

9
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:38,681
Our messiah of silence.

10
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:44,683
Now, my excellent minions
are planning as such.

11
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:47,951
Please, bear with us for just a while longer...

12
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:23,216
I suddenly look back...

13
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:27,220
...thinking someone called my name.

14
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:31,224
A pale fower of doubt suddenly bloomed.

15
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:35,262
Now, the next song...
Sorry to keep you waiting!

16
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:40,505
That's right, it's Jinta Araki's
new song, "Blue Crisis Love"!

17
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:46,213
Araki...

18
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,410
He's so wonderful!

19
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,400
Amazing.

20
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:06,562
Just like ants crawling over sugar.

21
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:09,334
I wonder if those chasers
have nothing better to do...

22
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:10,500
Chasers?

23
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,908
The people who chase after
musicians and other celebrities.

24
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,572
What do they do, chasing after celebrities?

25
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:18,081
They don't do much about it...

26
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:21,779
Yeah. I don't know how these people think.

27
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,117
Right, Minako?

28
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:26,487
Minako?

29
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,590
W-What?

30
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,790
What's wrong? You look dazed.

31
00:02:30,828 --> 00:02:32,625
O-Oh, nothing, really...

32
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:36,360
Even for us, chasing after
celebrities really isn't something...

33
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,301
O-Of course not!

34
00:02:38,336 --> 00:02:40,395
Hey, Mina? Jinta Araki is...

35
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:44,636
We're going to be in high school
next year! We can't be chasing...

36
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:46,768
Yeah, we got entrance exams
coming up, too...

37
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:47,470
Usagi.

38
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:49,639
- Do you really realize what that means!?
- ...and you have an announcement?

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,583
Yes. We would like to select the heroine
for the movie coming out next July...

40
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:56,985
...that I'll be the lead in... from one of you.

41
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:58,181
A public audition.

42
00:02:58,222 --> 00:03:02,921
The first cuts will be from 4:30p.m.
tomorrow at the Town Hallin Minato ward.

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,657
Since there'll be a swim suit competitionas
well, don't forget to bring your best swimsuit!

44
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:09,928
Let's have a hot summer with me next year!

45
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:12,265
My heroine--

46
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:18,139
A-About this problem...

47
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:19,268
Oh, this is...

48
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,510
Mimet.

49
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,520
Our messiah of silence is waiting.

50
00:03:29,554 --> 00:03:32,785
I hope you have the next plan already in gear.

51
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:35,520
Of course! Look at this, Professor...

52
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,122
Excuse me. Look at this.
He's the next target.

53
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:42,996
Oh?

54
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:46,128
Jinta Araki, also known as Alazin!
An 18-year-old with a wonderful smile.

55
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,628
His newly released song
"Blue Crisis Love" is on the rise!

56
00:03:49,674 --> 00:03:53,508
At the rate he's going, it's a matter
of time before he gets to the top...

57
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:56,646
A singer?

58
00:03:56,747 --> 00:04:03,516
Mimet... It seems like all
your targets are celebrities...

59
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:05,920
If you confuse our
objective with your hobbies...

60
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:09,188
...you won't go far here in Death Busters.

61
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:11,787
Y-You're kidding...!

62
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,959
T-That's not it.

63
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:22,370
Hobbies, that really isn't...

64
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:26,809
I choose celebrities only because
the hearts of people with...

65
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:31,281
...higher charisma are more effective
in awakening the true messiah.

66
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:33,215
Calling that my hobby...

67
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,186
I think I'm going to cry!

68
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,621
No, Mimet, you don't have to cry...

69
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:49,929
I am just worried about you, because
you have potential for a bright future.

70
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:52,397
P-Professor...

71
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:55,462
Keep doing a solid job from now on, all right?

72
00:04:55,506 --> 00:04:56,871
Sure!

73
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:59,877
The next high executive is you, Mimet!

74
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:01,708
I'll do my best!

75
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:03,577
Do a solid job.

76
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,846
"I love you, Araki!"

77
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:15,283
"I love Araki with a golden tan!"

78
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:25,224
And you substitute this X over here...

79
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:28,796
Usagi, you're amazing!
How do you understand this?

80
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,807
Not at all!

81
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,138
Hey... Where's Mina?

82
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:34,576
She said she had a fever from her cold,
so she'd stay at home and rest.

83
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,075
That probably means that Mina...

84
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,486
I'm here...

85
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:47,184
After all, I want to see just
one glimpse of the real Araki...

86
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:49,591
I didn't start being his fan just recently!

87
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:51,358
Um...

88
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:52,362
Yes?

89
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:57,095
A-Araki... When is Mr. Araki arriving?

90
00:05:58,002 --> 00:06:01,904
He won't be coming to today's audition.

91
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,601
He'll be appearing as a guest
during tomorrow's second round.

92
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,605
That can't be!

93
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:12,613
I thought I could get one glimpse of him...

94
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:15,617
You're...!

95
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:17,350
You're...!

96
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,053
This...

97
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:28,589
The original T-shirt that Alazin
released right when he debuted...

98
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:29,725
Not bad.

99
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,598
We both put in some years, haven't we?

100
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:34,597
I'm Minako Aino. Nice to meet you.

101
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:38,337
I'm Mime- no, Mimi. Mimi Hanyu.

102
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,612
Humans just have to put
everything into things they love!

103
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:47,117
Yeah!

104
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:50,679
Next, please...

105
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,086
Yes! Minako Aino!

106
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:56,093
I'm in 9th grade, and
my charm is my energy!

107
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:58,687
My special move is a flying, spinning dig!

108
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:05,202
There might be a kissing scene in
the scenario. What would you do?

109
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:10,700
Well, I will keep the whole movie
deal a secret from both my parents!

110
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,571
If you were to be accepted,
and were invited to dinner with the director...

111
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:20,049
What would you do?

112
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:23,884
Oh, I'll be fine!
I don't dislike any foods!

113
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,185
I can eat anything that is served to me!

114
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:29,488
Oh, but... I'm not too fond
of shitake mushrooms...

115
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:32,495
Next, please...

116
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:34,994
Oh, yes...

117
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:38,024
I-I'm Mime-- Mimi Hanyu.

118
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,004
My best wishes to all.

119
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:44,239
Why did you decide to take this audition?

120
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:48,006
Y-Yes... um, ur... uh...

121
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:51,609
You can talk slowly.
Just calm down...

122
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,550
I'm sorry... U-Um... er...

123
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:58,280
Thanks, that's enough.

124
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:03,049
I will announce the results of the first cuts.

125
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:05,558
Today, these 5 contestants will move on.

126
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,190
Only 5 will pass...

127
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:10,530
It's all but impossible...

128
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:13,537
Oh well, I just wanted to
catch a glimpse of Araki...

129
00:08:13,571 --> 00:08:14,629
#251 .

130
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:16,396
You're kidding!

131
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,738
That's amazing!

132
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:20,641
#252.

133
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,640
Those accepted, please step forward.

134
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:29,047
We will have these people move
on to the second cuts tomorrow.

135
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:31,611
Now, as we informed you earlier,
the final winner of this audition...

136
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:34,215
...will be playing a role in a movie
slated for release next summer...

137
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:11,793
If... I get accepted tomorrow...
What should I do?

138
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:14,430
Maybe I can be accepted...

139
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:16,524
NO, I'm sure I will be!

140
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,970
I'm beautiful, I got the right curves...

141
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:23,804
I, Mimet, can't possibly
lose against HUMANS!

142
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:36,049
Mimet!

143
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:41,718
Oh, Professor, you came!
How nice of you!

144
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:43,319
Mimet...

145
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,225
Yes?

146
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,766
It seems you have a fever...
and your eyes are bloodshot...

147
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,702
Working hard is nice and all,
but be careful of your health.

148
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:58,333
I don't want to lose talented workers like you...

149
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,239
S-Sure.

150
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,869
That's right...

151
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:03,641
I had totally forgotten.

152
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:07,515
I'm supposed to steal Araki's pure heart!

153
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:12,245
But then, Araki would die...

154
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:16,285
My loving Araki is going to die...

155
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:18,090
How pitiful...

156
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:22,758
Maybe this audition really
doesn't have any effect...

157
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,667
...and my professional debut as well...

158
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:32,871
I see... If I don't attack Araki,
I'll end up being a traitor...

159
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,711
...just when I'm about to fill the
role of the highest executive...

160
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:40,649
I'm counting on you...

161
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:45,621
Humans just have to put
everything into things they love!

162
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:48,925
That's right! That's got to be it!

163
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,723
I don't care about the
Death Busters anymore!

164
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:54,560
I will burn the summer away along with Araki!

165
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:59,559
I can become a traitor to
a syndicate like this for Araki!

166
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,233
In the first place, I'm a good girl deep
down, who can't do anything evil!

167
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:10,312
Who will wear the crown of the heroine...?

168
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:13,311
Today, we will have the members
of the audience helping us decide.

169
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:19,082
The person that 80% of the audience
backs up is the winner of our audition.

170
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:21,614
Now, the first person, please!

171
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,728
Artemis!!

172
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,396
Oh, no, how did you know...

173
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:36,338
It's not like you, Mina...
to keep it a secret from everyone...

174
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,743
Well... it became rather hard for me to tell
them that I've been chasing after Araki...

175
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:45,180
Now, please push the switch!

176
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:50,818
Mm... how unfortunate!

177
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:52,219
Next, #68.

178
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:00,222
I'm after the next one.

179
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:01,731
If you get accepted...

180
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:03,062
Yeah!

181
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,660
An idol pretty soldier will be born!

182
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:07,364
That's pretty ama--

183
00:12:09,273 --> 00:12:12,868
This morning, I had my favorite omelet.

184
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,775
In the future...

185
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:18,839
In the future, I would like
to become a big actress...

186
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:22,409
...a big actress who can handle any role...

187
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:26,355
I want to become an actress,
no matter what I do...

188
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:29,956
I want to be an actress...

189
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:33,827
We'll do our best...

190
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:35,161
How unfortunate.

191
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,827
Next, #251 ...

192
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:39,266
Okay!

193
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:46,176
#251 , Minako Aino.

194
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,611
I'm a 9th grader at Shiba Park
Junior High, in Minato ward.

195
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,608
It's a small world...

196
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:55,580
I give my best to you.

197
00:12:57,621 --> 00:12:59,851
This was really close!

198
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,381
Then, next person please...

199
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,191
- Do it well.
- Y-Yeah...

200
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:09,029
Oh, man, the dream of
becoming an idol pretty soldier...

201
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,365
But I guess it's okay
because I got to see Araki.

202
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:13,995
I'm honored.

203
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:17,905
That was really close.
But another chance will come by soon.

204
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:22,277
Araki... I'll keep cheering for you forever...

205
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:23,602
Thanks.

206
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:26,741
But you will someday forget about me...

207
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:28,684
No, not just you.

208
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,779
Everyone will forget
about me at some point...

209
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:33,221
But that's all right.

210
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:34,815
Even if you forget about me...

211
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:37,349
...the feelings you felt for me will remain.

212
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:40,921
After they move on from idols,
girls take their feelings of love...

213
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:43,694
...and learn what real romance is about.

214
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:45,224
Araki...!

215
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:48,067
But for now, give me your full support.

216
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:52,439
I don't plan to end as just an idol, either.

217
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:57,711
T-This morning, I had my favorite omelet.

218
00:13:57,748 --> 00:14:02,947
In the future, I would like to become a
big actress who can handle any role...

219
00:14:02,986 --> 00:14:04,783
Thank you for your consideration.

220
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:09,287
This is our final challenger.
Please push the switch!

221
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:25,807
This is most unfortunate.

222
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:36,881
Unfortunately, we end this audition
with no one making the cuts...

223
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,319
Are you all right, Miss Hanyu?

224
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,326
Miss Hanyu?

225
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:54,169
I am Mimet of the Death Busters!

226
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:59,904
I applied for this audition to take the pure
heart of Jinta Araki standing right there!

227
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:03,242
Appear, Daimohn Utahime!

228
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,817
Utahime!

229
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:12,854
CHARM...

230
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:18,183
...BUSTER!

231
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:27,062
Everyone is shaken up by my charm!

232
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:28,264
They're in pain...

233
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:29,237
Utahime...!

234
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:31,400
Oh, sorry, they're shaken up, right.

235
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,931
Get to it!

236
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:34,204
Yes!

237
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,249
A-Araki...

238
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:54,526
MOON TIARA...

239
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:56,192
...ACTION!

240
00:15:58,702 --> 00:15:59,930
What are you doing!?

241
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,562
That hurt!

242
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:04,570
You're the singer, and I'm the listener!

243
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,707
Songs are everyone's friends!

244
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:08,643
Bad guys who assault our idols!

245
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,476
We, fighters of love and justice...

246
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:11,572
...the Sailor Team...

247
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:16,784
...will punish you in the name of the moon!

248
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:18,285
Guys!

249
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:23,891
VENUS STAR POWER...

250
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,327
MAKE UP!

251
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:48,348
Mimet!

252
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:51,247
Pretending to be a chaser,
only to assault Araki...

253
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:52,949
You are the enemy to every fan!

254
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,121
Ally to every idol in the world...

255
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:57,319
Sailor Venus!

256
00:16:57,361 --> 00:17:02,298
I'll have the divine punishment
of love fall upon you.

257
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:03,893
Shut up!

258
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:05,868
I wasn't pretending!

259
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:09,304
But I'm Mimet of the Witches 5!

260
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:13,302
Then, you really care about Araki...?

261
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:16,712
That's none of your business!

262
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:20,877
This way, Araki's heart... is ours forever!

263
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:25,184
Chasers have their own set of rules!

264
00:17:25,222 --> 00:17:29,556
They're not supposed to cause trouble
to the idols that they chase! Sheesh!

265
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,089
Araki is going to die!

266
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,927
Geez! Of course!

267
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:37,490
The Death Busters is an evil syndicate!

268
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:41,971
Utahime! Kill all of them
with your killer songs!

269
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,438
Utahime!

270
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:49,645
What's wrong? Hurry up!

271
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,174
To get a perfect song,
please wait while I warm up my voice.

272
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:59,251
Hurry up!

273
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,314
KILLER SONG!

274
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:10,694
I forgot the lyrics...

275
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:11,826
W-What!?

276
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,835
N-Now, Sailor Moon!

277
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:15,565
Yeah!!

278
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:20,101
CRISIS...

279
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:22,543
MAKE UP!

280
00:18:49,973 --> 00:18:53,238
RAINBOW...

281
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:54,903
...MOON...

282
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:57,914
...HEART ACHE!

283
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:05,614
I remember now...

284
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,984
L-Love is...

285
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:16,524
Love-Lovely!

286
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:29,172
T-This I can't...

287
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:31,339
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

288
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:35,848
I'll get you for this!

289
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:39,249
They seem to be gathering pure hearts...

290
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:41,784
For what purpose now?

291
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:46,262
Pure hearts can become energy
for the ones who move the world.

292
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:49,455
Or, they have already found the evil one...

293
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:51,763
...the messiah of silence...

294
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:56,497
Here.

295
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,001
You return it, Venus.

296
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:01,773
You've been a fan since 7th grade, right?

297
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:04,042
I heard you've been chasing
after him all this time.

298
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,013
Amazing!

299
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,782
You blabbermouth!

300
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:13,050
I am terribly sorry.

301
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,785
I have failed.

302
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:16,690
I'm so frustrated!

303
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:20,423
I really am frustrated, Professor!

304
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:26,027
There is always tomorrow, Mimet...

305
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:33,027
