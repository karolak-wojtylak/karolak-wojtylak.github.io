WEBVTT

00:02.382 --> 00:05.579
We have to find the Messiah now!?

00:05.619 --> 00:09.316
On top of that, strange enemies are
appearing, and we're in a bind!

00:09.356 --> 00:13.258
Hey, Chibiusa! What are you running
around at a time like this for?

00:13.293 --> 00:15.659
What happened to your
"cherished meetings"?

00:15.696 --> 00:17.755
Bad girls who forget their training...

00:17.798 --> 00:20.528
...get punished in the name of the moon!

00:47.800 --> 00:50.496
Our messiah of silence...

00:50.536 --> 00:52.697
How are you feeling today?

00:53.239 --> 00:55.707
My head feels a little heavy...

00:55.741 --> 00:59.837
Hurry up and give me a perfect pure heart...

00:59.879 --> 01:01.471
I understand.

01:01.514 --> 01:05.211
I need to take perfect
pure hearts from humans...

01:05.251 --> 01:09.312
...and transfer them into
energy for your awakening.

01:23.869 --> 01:28.169
As you can see, cormorants
dive underwater to catch fish...

01:28.207 --> 01:30.903
...and keep the fish deep in their throats.

01:30.943 --> 01:33.377
"Ukai" is a fishing method
using this trait of these birds...

01:33.412 --> 01:37.143
...and we will use this method as reference
in getting pure hearts from now on.

01:37.183 --> 01:40.675
First, we approach the target,
and release a Daimohn.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.984
The Daimohn will swallow the pure heart...

01:43.022 --> 01:45.388
...and come back to me.

01:45.424 --> 01:48.951
Then, I will make it spit out the pure heart.

01:48.994 --> 01:53.226
It is a very safe yet effective method...

01:53.265 --> 01:54.596
Mimet!

01:56.535 --> 02:00.096
Are my lectures that boring?

02:00.272 --> 02:02.467
Um...

02:02.842 --> 02:05.606
To bring such things into your work place...

02:05.644 --> 02:09.512
It's nice following trends and all, but it
is troubling if you forget your work...

02:09.548 --> 02:12.483
Do you have clues as to where the
pure hearts are in the first place?

02:14.520 --> 02:16.784
Of course, Professor!

02:16.822 --> 02:21.054
I have already found someone
with a heart of amazing purity!

02:21.093 --> 02:25.792
I see... Then I shall sit back and
see how you work, Mimet.

02:26.365 --> 02:29.232
Sailor Moon isn't the true messiah, anyway.

02:30.102 --> 02:35.438
When the time comes,
the Grail will choose its own user.

02:35.474 --> 02:40.002
In other words, we will awaken
the messiah of silence first.

02:40.813 --> 02:44.681
That is correct, Mimet.

02:51.290 --> 02:53.690
Western!

03:24.256 --> 03:29.387
Celebrities who show dreams to their fans
must have hearts that are purer than most...

03:29.428 --> 03:33.762
I will use that energy to
awaken our messiah!

03:37.369 --> 03:40.167
If the correct person
gets a hold of the grail...

03:40.206 --> 03:44.472
...the world will be filled with divine light,
and evil of all sorts will be crushed.

03:44.810 --> 03:48.507
However, if evil hands
get a hold of the grail...

03:48.547 --> 03:53.985
...the entire world will be ruled by darkness,
and the age of shadows will begin.

03:54.486 --> 03:57.580
If that happens, the future will
change as well, of course...

04:00.226 --> 04:02.421
Then, that foretelling dream...!!

04:03.963 --> 04:08.400
Setsuna, you came here from the
future to tell us about that, right?

04:08.434 --> 04:09.731
Yes...

04:09.768 --> 04:11.360
Well, I'll be going now.

04:11.403 --> 04:13.132
Eh?! Why?

04:13.539 --> 04:19.569
I must find the messiah along
with Sailor Uranus and Neptune.

04:19.912 --> 04:22.073
W-Wait a minute!

04:26.252 --> 04:28.812
Why just the three of them...?

04:29.688 --> 04:33.124
Oh, man, she could have
told us a lot more stuff!.

04:33.158 --> 04:34.625
Don't ask for too much!

04:34.660 --> 04:37.424
I'm sure she has all sorts
of reasons of her own...

04:37.563 --> 04:39.622
But, you know...

04:39.665 --> 04:42.657
But... It's a shame that
Usagi isn't the messiah.

04:42.701 --> 04:46.137
In any case, we have to think
of how to find the messiah.

04:46.171 --> 04:48.503
But where do we look...?

04:48.540 --> 04:52.476
You know, how about
zeroing in on the diners?

04:52.511 --> 04:57.847
They say the messiah, so she just has
to be in a "meshi-ya"! (food place)

04:57.883 --> 04:58.872
Sheesh...

04:58.918 --> 05:00.385
Hello!

05:02.254 --> 05:03.721
Hey... Where's Plu?

05:03.756 --> 05:07.157
Setsuna left, saying she
had something to do.

05:07.893 --> 05:12.626
Darn... I was planning on
going to the park with her...

05:13.499 --> 05:16.730
Hey, no way! I can't!
I have no time for that now!

05:18.804 --> 05:20.135
Darn.

05:20.172 --> 05:23.266
Chibiusa, which park were
you planning to go to?

05:23.309 --> 05:25.903
Juban Natural Park...

05:25.945 --> 05:27.879
Then, I'll take you there!

05:27.913 --> 05:29.039
Really!?

05:29.081 --> 05:30.070
Come on...

05:30.115 --> 05:33.573
Minako! We're in the middle of
an important discussion, right!?

05:33.619 --> 05:37.419
Usagi, don't say that, you sound like Ami...

05:37.456 --> 05:40.425
Minako... what is in that park?

05:42.094 --> 05:43.186
Minako!

05:44.430 --> 05:47.058
Oh, all right! I'll confess!

05:47.099 --> 05:51.195
Actually, there's a filming for
a Yosaku Eda movie there today!

05:52.271 --> 05:54.831
Filming a Yosaku Eda movie!? Amazing!

05:54.873 --> 05:57.273
Chibiusa! I'll go along with you!

05:57.309 --> 05:58.333
You know...

05:59.011 --> 06:00.706
Yosaku Eda, huh...?

06:00.746 --> 06:03.647
He's so cool, it's a little like HI M...

06:03.682 --> 06:06.276
See? See? Don't you
want to see the real thing?

06:06.318 --> 06:08.411
Okay, that's it!
You're coming with us, right, Rei?

06:08.454 --> 06:11.651
Well, I guess I can go along...

06:11.690 --> 06:13.590
All right! Hey, let's go, Ami!

06:13.625 --> 06:16.526
Usagi, what are we going
to do about the messiah...?

06:16.562 --> 06:21.056
Well, well! You never know,
the messiah could be in such a place!

06:21.100 --> 06:22.397
Why?

06:22.434 --> 06:25.096
Why? Well, that's because... uh...

06:29.308 --> 06:32.505
I-In other words, a hunch! My hunch!

06:32.544 --> 06:34.307
All right, let's go.

06:34.346 --> 06:35.813
Even Ami...

06:35.848 --> 06:37.509
You guys aren't being serious!

06:37.549 --> 06:40.017
We need to change our pace every so often.

06:40.052 --> 06:43.283
I think it's better than worrying about
something and not getting anything done.

06:43.322 --> 06:48.624
That's right! And studying in the great
wilderness might help us learn, too!

06:48.660 --> 06:51.424
Oh, no, I thought we were
going there to have fun...?

06:51.463 --> 06:52.259
Oh...?

06:52.297 --> 06:56.063
All right! Let's all go to Juban Natural Park!

06:56.101 --> 06:57.625
Yeah!

06:57.669 --> 07:00.160
Oh, boy...

07:02.775 --> 07:06.973
Yosaku Eda is filming the movie
"The Akafuji Gunman" on location today...

07:07.012 --> 07:09.071
That must be it!

07:09.114 --> 07:11.605
Yosaku is...

07:11.850 --> 07:13.078
There, that's him!

07:14.153 --> 07:17.213
He really is handsome... Yosaku...

07:17.256 --> 07:19.247
Before I abduct his
pure heart and kill him...

07:19.291 --> 07:21.782
...I should at least have him
eat a handmade cake!

07:21.827 --> 07:23.317
Yosaku!

07:26.031 --> 07:28.693
What are you going to do,
approaching Yosaku like that!?

07:28.734 --> 07:31.726
Yosaku is in the middle of
very important work right now!

07:31.770 --> 07:35.206
It's distracting to see you in such
an outfit loitering around here!

07:35.240 --> 07:36.172
Yeah, really!

07:36.208 --> 07:39.143
All I wanted to do is to have
him eat a handmade cake...

07:39.178 --> 07:41.169
A cake? Ha!

07:41.213 --> 07:44.649
Yosaku hates sweet stuff!.

07:45.951 --> 07:49.284
Even ants won't touch a cake like that! Right?

07:49.321 --> 07:52.415
Yeah! Take this as your lesson,
and don't get near Yosaku!

07:52.458 --> 07:54.119
My cake...

07:54.159 --> 07:55.786
What's wrong?

07:57.963 --> 08:00.022
Those girls were my fans, right?

08:00.399 --> 08:01.798
Oh... No...

08:01.834 --> 08:04.803
Lately, they've been rather abrasive...

08:04.837 --> 08:07.032
This cake... was it actually for me...?

08:07.439 --> 08:08.872
Y-Yes...

08:08.907 --> 08:13.037
You took the time to bake it,
but it all went to waste...

08:13.979 --> 08:15.037
It's delicious.

08:17.015 --> 08:18.107
Thanks!

08:18.150 --> 08:19.640
- See ya!
- Stay and watch for a while.

08:20.419 --> 08:24.287
Yosaku... They said that
he didn't like sweets...

08:24.323 --> 08:26.655
It's love! This must be love!!

08:27.159 --> 08:31.255
Yosaku... He must have fallen
deeply in love with meat first glance!

08:31.296 --> 08:32.228
But...

08:32.264 --> 08:36.530
I am destined to take your
pure heart and kill you...

08:36.568 --> 08:39.401
I'm sure it's tough for you,
but give up on this romance...

08:40.139 --> 08:41.731
Don't come any closer!

08:41.773 --> 08:44.901
You're going to get into another fight anyway.

08:44.943 --> 08:46.774
If you're going to leave me alone...

08:46.812 --> 08:48.370
...don't come after me!

08:49.681 --> 08:52.514
I won't leave you all alone...!

08:52.551 --> 08:53.381
Joe...

08:53.619 --> 08:56.782
Oh... how handsome...

08:56.822 --> 08:58.619
Yosaku...

08:59.124 --> 09:02.150
If I steal your pure heart...

09:02.194 --> 09:04.424
...this movie will remain incomplete...

09:04.463 --> 09:06.522
But I won't forget.

09:06.565 --> 09:11.764
I will engrave your last
performance deep into my eyes!

09:17.409 --> 09:19.877
The hat that Moma-Ikuko bought for me!

09:20.345 --> 09:22.040
Someone catch it!

09:22.080 --> 09:24.913
It's an important hat!

09:29.821 --> 09:31.083
Wait...!

09:39.998 --> 09:41.295
Here...

09:41.333 --> 09:42.163
Thank you!

09:42.701 --> 09:46.797
I'm glad... it didn't fall into the river.

09:47.105 --> 09:48.231
Are you all right?

09:49.508 --> 09:52.136
It's just another seizure...

09:52.177 --> 09:53.474
Don't worry.

09:54.580 --> 09:55.979
But...

09:56.481 --> 09:59.917
It'll be over... in a minute.

10:06.892 --> 10:08.223
I'm all right now.

10:08.260 --> 10:10.023
I'm glad.

10:10.062 --> 10:11.996
I know! Do you want to play with me?

10:13.865 --> 10:15.662
I'm Chibiusa!

10:19.071 --> 10:20.663
I'm Hotaru.

10:36.021 --> 10:38.512
All right! Time for a break!

10:41.260 --> 10:44.024
Is could get at least an
autograph before I kill him...

10:45.998 --> 10:47.295
Yosaku...

10:51.336 --> 10:53.099
Is it all right? In a place like this...

10:53.138 --> 10:55.698
We don't have time to see each other
unless it's sometime like this, right?

10:55.741 --> 10:59.507
- That's true...
- Yosaku... He has me, and yet...

10:59.544 --> 11:01.205
How dare he!!

11:01.246 --> 11:03.305
In that case...

11:04.816 --> 11:07.546
Appear, Daimohn!

11:13.191 --> 11:15.591
Western!

11:40.218 --> 11:41.617
Western!

11:42.454 --> 11:43.443
Run!

11:43.755 --> 11:46.622
Yosaku really is after that woman...!

11:46.658 --> 11:49.991
Western! Take Yosaku's pure heart!

11:50.028 --> 11:52.724
Hi-yo, Silver!

11:53.899 --> 11:57.266
Western! Western! Western! Western!

11:57.302 --> 11:58.462
Hi-yo!

12:03.575 --> 12:05.065
Help us!

12:05.510 --> 12:06.340
What's going on!?

12:06.378 --> 12:07.436
Bang! Bang!

12:10.882 --> 12:13.248
I haven't paid you back for the cake yet!

12:13.285 --> 12:16.049
Western! Make sure you take
good care of those girls!!

12:16.088 --> 12:18.283
Bang! Bang! Bang!

12:18.323 --> 12:19.153
- Oh, my god!
- Help!

12:26.331 --> 12:27.320
What should I do...?

12:27.366 --> 12:30.358
I can't transform in front of Hotaru...

12:31.069 --> 12:33.367
Woohoo! Mako-chan's box lunch!

12:33.405 --> 12:37.102
But... how far did Chibiusa go to play?

12:37.142 --> 12:38.700
It's rather rowdy...

12:38.744 --> 12:41.838
Is break over already?

12:42.547 --> 12:43.138
That's...

12:43.181 --> 12:44.148
A Daimohn!

12:44.182 --> 12:46.776
Everyone! Let's transform!

12:47.285 --> 12:48.946
Western! That's enough!

12:48.987 --> 12:51.478
Hurry up and take Yosaku's pure heart!

12:51.656 --> 12:53.351
Okay! Western!

12:55.026 --> 12:56.220
Hold it right there!

12:59.398 --> 13:02.561
Interrupting the shooting of
a fun movie for people...

13:02.601 --> 13:05.570
...an outlaw chasing after
innocent people with a gun!

13:05.604 --> 13:09.870
Even if Wyatt Earp forgives you,
we won't forgive you!

13:09.908 --> 13:11.102
In the name of the moon...

13:11.143 --> 13:12.508
...we'll punish you!

13:13.078 --> 13:13.908
Shut up!

13:13.945 --> 13:15.913
Western, get them!

13:15.947 --> 13:17.881
Yeah! Western!

13:18.650 --> 13:20.015
Leave it to me!

13:40.238 --> 13:44.299
MOON SPIRAL...

13:44.342 --> 13:47.311
...HEART...

13:47.345 --> 13:49.836
...ATTACK!

13:51.316 --> 13:52.374
Bang!

13:52.417 --> 13:53.941
Bang! Bang!

13:56.154 --> 13:57.781
The attack doesn't work!?

13:57.823 --> 13:59.723
It's different from previous Daimohns!

14:01.626 --> 14:03.218
Western! Now's your chance!

14:08.767 --> 14:09.961
Yumi!

14:12.337 --> 14:13.964
Dammit...!

14:22.848 --> 14:24.338
You're kidding...

14:24.382 --> 14:25.576
She ate it!

14:25.617 --> 14:29.053
Well done, Western!
Let's go back to the professor now!

14:29.087 --> 14:30.111
Yeah! Western!

14:30.355 --> 14:32.585
WORLD SHAKING!

14:32.724 --> 14:35.249
DEEP SUBMERGE!

14:41.967 --> 14:42.797
What!?

14:43.034 --> 14:44.865
Guided by a new era...

14:44.903 --> 14:47.167
Sailor Uranus acts with elegance!

14:47.205 --> 14:49.799
Sailor Neptune acts with grace!

14:52.878 --> 14:53.810
That's it!

14:55.080 --> 14:57.674
Western! Grab those kids!!

15:02.220 --> 15:04.188
Look out!

15:04.222 --> 15:05.246
Chibiusa!

15:06.658 --> 15:08.250
Western!

15:08.293 --> 15:09.419
Chibiusa!

15:12.631 --> 15:15.532
Don't move until we're far, far away!

15:15.567 --> 15:19.469
If you move even just a
little bit, this girl... Well...

15:19.504 --> 15:21.438
I won't care what happens!

15:21.873 --> 15:23.773
Chibiusa...

15:26.478 --> 15:29.038
DEAD SCREAM...

15:36.421 --> 15:37.683
Plu!

15:38.256 --> 15:41.191
Sailor Moon!
Under go your second transformation!

15:45.030 --> 15:47.055
CRISIS...

15:47.098 --> 15:49.498
MAKE UP!

15:57.342 --> 15:58.468
Western!

16:18.730 --> 16:22.427
RAINBOW...

16:22.467 --> 16:23.991
...MOON...

16:24.035 --> 16:27.527
HEART ACHE!

16:37.082 --> 16:40.483
Love... LOVELY!

16:56.534 --> 16:59.662
I'll get you for this!!

17:02.040 --> 17:03.940
What was that?

17:03.975 --> 17:06.773
It seems like our new enemy...

17:10.248 --> 17:11.772
Usagi!

17:13.218 --> 17:14.776
This is really tough...

17:18.256 --> 17:19.280
Chibiusa...

17:19.324 --> 17:20.621
Hotaru!

17:20.659 --> 17:21.489
Ouch...

17:21.526 --> 17:22.925
Chibiusa!

17:22.961 --> 17:25.361
Oh, no! You're hurt!

17:25.397 --> 17:28.195
I'm sorry... it was because
you covered for me...

17:28.233 --> 17:30.861
It's just a scratch. I'm all right!

17:30.902 --> 17:32.767
Let me take a look at it.

17:47.886 --> 17:49.080
Amazing!

17:50.789 --> 17:54.987
Everyone in my class is scared of this...
And they won't come close to me...

17:55.026 --> 17:59.326
It really is creepy, to have powers like this.

17:59.597 --> 18:01.792
That's not true!

18:02.734 --> 18:05.328
It's wonderful! It really is!

18:06.271 --> 18:07.829
Really...?

18:08.339 --> 18:09.829
Yeah!

18:14.646 --> 18:16.978
Thank--

18:18.216 --> 18:20.377
Are you all right, Hotaru?

18:20.418 --> 18:22.545
I'm all right...

18:22.921 --> 18:25.014
Hey, Hotaru...?

18:25.056 --> 18:26.990
Hold it together, Hotaru!

18:31.896 --> 18:32.988
I'm glad...

18:33.031 --> 18:36.797
But why are they still after pure hearts?

18:36.835 --> 18:40.271
Sailor Moon!
I'll let you hold onto the Grail for a while.

18:40.305 --> 18:43.138
Wait! Hey, let's look for
the Messiah together!!

18:44.609 --> 18:46.236
That can't happen.

18:46.277 --> 18:48.074
We're different from you.

18:48.113 --> 18:50.172
We'll look for the Messiah.

18:50.215 --> 18:52.649
What do you mean by that?

18:59.257 --> 19:02.021
Why Pluto as well...?

19:02.060 --> 19:03.994
That's right, where's Chibiusa?

19:04.028 --> 19:05.859
She was here until a moment ago.

19:05.897 --> 19:09.162
Sheesh, that girl really...

19:13.338 --> 19:15.033
I'm sorry to make you worry...

19:15.073 --> 19:16.802
It's really all right!

19:16.841 --> 19:18.502
Oh, it's Papa.

19:18.543 --> 19:20.033
Is that you, Hotaru?

19:21.079 --> 19:24.810
What happened? I was worried
because you were so late.

19:24.849 --> 19:26.783
I just had a seizure...

19:27.118 --> 19:30.781
Papa, this is Chibiusa.
She walked me all the way home.

19:31.256 --> 19:34.521
I see... Thank you, Chibiusa.

19:34.859 --> 19:36.349
See ya.

19:36.394 --> 19:37.759
Can I see you again?

19:38.062 --> 19:40.530
Yeah! We're already friends!

19:41.032 --> 19:43.523
Friends...

19:44.936 --> 19:46.528
I'm happy for you, Hotaru.

19:46.905 --> 19:49.339
Papa...

19:49.674 --> 19:51.073
Well, I'll see you later!

19:51.109 --> 19:52.098
See you...!

19:52.143 --> 19:54.543
Come visit us again.
We'll be waiting for you!

19:54.913 --> 19:56.813
Sure!

19:56.848 --> 20:00.045
I want to see my papa, too...

20:00.985 --> 20:02.452
Good night, Papa.

20:02.487 --> 20:04.853
Good night, Hotaru.

20:07.853 --> 20:11.853
