1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,491
Hey, do you know
about motocross?

2
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:06,059
It's a really brutal race...

3
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:08,038
...where you cross bumpy
dirt roads on motorcycles!

4
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:10,802
Haruka, who loves motorcycles,
is participating as well!

5
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:14,209
But there are bad guys using
such a race to set a trap!

6
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:15,906
I won't forgive them!

7
00:00:15,947 --> 00:00:20,247
I, Sailor Moon, will punish
you in the name of the moon!

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,811
The five Sailor Soldiers!

9
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:41,328
And the always unexpected
arrival of that Tuxedo Mask!

10
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:46,090
They are nothing but a
group of noisy annoyances!

11
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:48,400
Furthermore, there are
the mysterious soldiers...

12
00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:51,134
...who call themselves
Uranus and Neptune!

13
00:00:51,174 --> 00:00:56,168
These two are seeking the
talismans just like us!

14
00:00:56,212 --> 00:01:00,979
For some reason, these two always
appear wherever Daimohn are.

15
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:06,450
Perhaps they know what
our plan of attack is.

16
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:10,789
In that case, use that
and lure them instead!

17
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:12,356
Yes!

18
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:15,831
I'll make sure to lure them
both out and annihilate them.

19
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:47,989
Dammit...

20
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:50,297
Amazing! Amazing!

21
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,733
Haruka won by such
a huge margin!

22
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,401
Such a superior
riding technique...!

23
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,603
She has a lot of talent to
win against all those boys.

24
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:02,469
This is a problem...

25
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:04,446
What's wrong, Ami?

26
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:07,678
I got so excited that I forgot one
of my English vocabulary words...

27
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:18,960
Here!

28
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:20,724
Thanks, Michiru.

29
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,629
Oh, Haruka!

30
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:26,100
- Oh, buns-head.
- You were here?

31
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:29,935
Yeah. We were all brought
here by Mamo-chan.

32
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:40,242
Hey, Haruka Tenoh.
You won, and you're a GIRL!

33
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:41,978
You're awfully arrogant.

34
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:44,646
It doesn't matter if
you're male or female.

35
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:46,086
Whoever is fastest wins.

36
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:47,589
What?

37
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:50,058
Are you trying to
threaten a girl?

38
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:52,789
It's pathetic to
watch losers whine.

39
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:55,093
- What was that?
- Stop it!

40
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,462
Yamada...

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,462
We just have to win the
next race. Let's go.

42
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:02,735
Just be careful that
you don't get hurt.

43
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:07,068
Mamo-chan!

44
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,372
Who's he?

45
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:10,140
Katsutoshi Yamada.

46
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,149
The guy who placed second
in the race that just ended.

47
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:16,050
He's very passionate
about motocross racing.

48
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:18,410
A very "pure" individual.

49
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,617
He's the type that would
have a pure heart crystal.

50
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,254
It looks like we should
keep an eye on him.

51
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:29,594
- Leave it to me!
- Please.

52
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:35,033
Welcome! Welcome!

53
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:38,303
These rider dolls are
really popular right now!

54
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:41,174
And they're just
1000 yen each!

55
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:43,839
First come, first served!
Come and get them now!

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,313
Welcome, welcome.

57
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:47,578
Hey, it's cute.

58
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:51,676
Let's see. This feels good!

59
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:58,858
W-What's this? Wait for me!

60
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,099
- Usagi's over there!
- Oh, Usagi!

61
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,033
She wasn't on this bus?

62
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:08,070
I didn't realize she wasn't!
What should we do?

63
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:10,197
She's not a kid.
She'll come later.

64
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,868
Sheesh, she sure
is a troublemaker!

65
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,209
Oh, no... Everyone's gone now.

66
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:26,248
Let's see,
the next bus is...

67
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,685
I have to wait
another hour!?

68
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:33,690
Get on.

69
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,662
Haruka!

70
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:36,995
- I'll take you back.
- B-But...

71
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,796
Don't worry. Come on.

72
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:41,463
A-All right.
Excuse me, then...

73
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,028
Hold on tight!

74
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:06,353
He's going for
me on purpose!

75
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:08,796
Buns-head, make sure you're
holding on really tight!

76
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:17,468
Dammit!

77
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:27,878
Sheesh! Why do you have
to be harassed, Haruka?

78
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:29,981
I think it was those
guys from earlier.

79
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:32,478
Impossible!

80
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,289
It really IS them!

81
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,486
Dammit, where did they hide?

82
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:43,990
I feel like I'm in
the arms of a man...

83
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:47,195
Haruka, you smell
really nice.

84
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:50,468
U-Um, what cologne do you use?

85
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,470
Quiet!

86
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:56,801
Do you have something
you need from me?

87
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:58,438
You! Get her!

88
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:00,379
Look out!

89
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:07,218
Stop with the unfair tricks!

90
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,521
Races should be fought
and won fair and square!

91
00:06:11,394 --> 00:06:12,759
Dammit...

92
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:16,727
Haruka, you're strong!

93
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:39,952
I'll win!

94
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:44,450
In the next motocross race,
I'll make sure I win!

95
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:21,957
So, it was him!

96
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:25,228
- This is strange.
- Did something break?

97
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:30,898
Looks like the spark
plug went haywire.

98
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:39,782
The sea's grown stormy. Get to the
motocross practice area, fast!

99
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:41,408
Got it!

100
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:44,545
I have a sudden errand now!
Since my bike's broken...

101
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:46,612
...I don't think I can take you home.

102
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:49,352
Head over to the road there and
you can catch a bus to the station.

103
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:51,917
O-Okay! I can
go home by myself.

104
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,494
I'm sorry!

105
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:57,098
I wonder what the
sudden errand was?

106
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,693
She seemed a little strange.
I wonder...

107
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:14,077
TIREN!

108
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:33,700
I surely have the crystal
of your pure heart, TIREN.

109
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:36,432
I won't let you
have it your way!

110
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:37,939
Who are you?

111
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,739
By the stormy
waters of Neptune...

112
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:45,475
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Neptune...

113
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:47,176
...acts with grace!

114
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:55,284
DEEP SUBMERGE!

115
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,296
No, this isn't
a talisman.

116
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,706
Hurry and run to
someplace safe!

117
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,204
I've been waiting
for you, Sailor Neptune!

118
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:23,048
I don't care if that guy's
crystal is a talisman or not.

119
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:26,453
We've been waiting
for you to arrive.

120
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:27,717
What did you say?

121
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:30,855
DOUBLE TIREN!

122
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:36,021
What!?

123
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:48,770
Die!

124
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:49,937
Wait!

125
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:55,279
So, Sailor Uranus
is here, too...

126
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:58,047
Both of you can die together!

127
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:00,612
Haruka sure runs fast!

128
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:41,523
TIREN!

129
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:45,991
All right!

130
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:53,736
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

131
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,246
Sailor Uranus, don't fight it.

132
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:35,750
If you fight,
your friend's life is over!

133
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:36,375
What?

134
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,359
I won't let you do
such an unfair thing!

135
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,838
Who are you?

136
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,041
For love and justice, the
pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

137
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,809
Sailor Moon!

138
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:07,881
Sailor Moon...

139
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:11,283
Battles should all
be done fair and square.

140
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,413
I'm not allied
with either of you...

141
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:15,549
...but I won't forgive your
using unfair tactics!

142
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:21,828
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

143
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:23,323
Enough of that!

144
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:25,834
DOUBLE TIREN!

145
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:31,898
Uranus, hurry!
Take Neptune and run!

146
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:33,802
Stay out of this!

147
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:37,403
Y-You idiot! Hurry and run!

148
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:41,706
Uranus!

149
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:44,909
I'll defeat them!
Get out of my way!

150
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:48,185
I don't want to! You should
be the one running away!

151
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:54,024
Those two aren't doing
anything together!

152
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:55,792
Get them right now!

153
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:58,800
CHAIN RING!

154
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:02,698
Oh, no!

155
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:04,535
TIREN!

156
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:11,904
You don't seem to
be good friends.

157
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:14,973
It's like watching a bad
attempt at a 3-legged race!

158
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:26,060
You must hate a partner
who doesn't go your way.

159
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:30,031
You can both die now,
hating each other.

160
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:38,504
Uranus, run away for now!

161
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:41,202
You need to stay alive
and complete our mission!

162
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:43,209
TIREN!

163
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:50,815
Neptune!

164
00:13:57,426 --> 00:13:58,757
NO!!!

165
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:00,694
W-What?

166
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,927
What are you doing?
The waterfall is the other way!

167
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:06,230
Follow them!
Follow the two of them!

168
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:11,037
TIREN!

169
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,988
Neptune might still be alive!

170
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:32,550
Aren't you worried?

171
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:35,257
Are you going to abandon
your friend and run away?

172
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:36,286
This isn't coming off.

173
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:37,856
That hurts! Don't pull on it!

174
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,595
Stop whining!

175
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:47,068
It looks like they're gone.

176
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:49,134
Come on, let's go save her!

177
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:51,669
Don't you care if Neptune dies?!

178
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:53,978
If we go out
like this, we'll die!

179
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:57,712
You're heartless! I thought
she was your partner!

180
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,815
You really are a cruel person!!

181
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,220
What do you know?!

182
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,554
Neptune and I made a promise.

183
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:12,465
That if something were to
happen to either of us...

184
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:15,402
...we wouldn't be caught by
our emotions to save the other.

185
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,006
Whoever survives completes the
mission of finding the talismans.

186
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:25,346
That is what the
two of us decided.

187
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:30,044
What are these talismans that
you have to find so badly?

188
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:32,384
I don't have to tell you!

189
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:33,786
What do you mean!?

190
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:37,350
People whose pure heart crystals
are stolen all suffer...

191
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:39,452
...and die!

192
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:42,259
How can you be
so cold like that!?

193
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:45,229
Why?!

194
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,757
You're naive.

195
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,434
Right now, silence is
approaching the world.

196
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:52,964
Soon, something horrible
will happen.

197
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,806
To save the world from that,
we need the talismans.

198
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,870
Nobody wants any victims.

199
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:03,316
However, if that saves
the rest of the world...

200
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,481
What would you do?!

201
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:26,405
Neptune... Is she dead?
Where are you?

202
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:32,306
Oh, sorry...

203
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:34,475
You're bleeding!
It's a deep wound!

204
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:36,417
I'm sorry I didn't notice!

205
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:37,942
I'm all right!

206
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,011
It's all right.
Really, it is.

207
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,626
Don't touch me!

208
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:47,856
It would be a mess
if it got infected.

209
00:16:47,897 --> 00:16:49,159
Mind your own business!

210
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:50,425
It's all right, really!

211
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,366
You don't need to be
so humble about it.

212
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:55,502
Why?

213
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:58,472
I can't stand to leave
someone injured...

214
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,509
...without doing anything.

215
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,511
You are such a...

216
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:06,106
By the way...
I have a favor to ask you.

217
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:07,342
What is it?

218
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:10,216
You might think it's not
proper at a time like this...

219
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:12,277
...but my back's been
really itchy for a while...

220
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,549
...and I can't
stand it anymore!

221
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,887
I'm sorry, but can you
scratch it for me?

222
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:19,590
A little further left...

223
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:22,028
Yeah, there, there!
Oh, that feels good!

224
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:25,063
You're a strange person.

225
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:28,159
Sailor Moon, huh...

226
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,669
You always got in my way, and I
didn't think much of you, but...

227
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:33,004
Being here with
you like this...

228
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,976
What about being with me?

229
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:38,236
They're here...

230
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:45,515
This cologne I smell...
Could it be...?!

231
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:48,790
TIREN!

232
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:55,124
We should go
look for Neptune!

233
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,672
They've come out! Kill them!

234
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,444
TIREN!

235
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,446
Here, over here, over here!

236
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:18,113
Their movement!
They're nothing like...

237
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:20,986
...the uncoordinated
couple they were before!

238
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:23,787
CHAIN RING!

239
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:27,525
Oh, those idiots!

240
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,464
But why are they suddenly able
to act in synch with each other?

241
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:38,762
She's still alive! DIE!

242
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,670
I won't let her die!

243
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,506
W-What!?

244
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,108
WORLD SHAKING!

245
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:57,517
TIREEEEEN!

246
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:30,656
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

247
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:43,463
Lovely!

248
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:56,143
I'll get you for this!

249
00:19:57,586 --> 00:19:58,644
We did it!

250
00:19:58,821 --> 00:19:59,719
Yeah.

251
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:03,821
I'll give you a
little bit of credit.

252
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:06,760
But I won't let anyone get
in the way of our mission.

253
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:14,392
Neptune!

254
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,769
Uranus... Why did you
risk your life to save me?

255
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:22,436
She was the one
who rescued you.

256
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:28,240
Sailor Moon did?!

257
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,240
