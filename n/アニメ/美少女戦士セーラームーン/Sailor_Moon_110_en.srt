1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,868
Please, Haruka... Michiru...

2
00:00:05,903 --> 00:00:09,600
Stop chasing after
someone's pure heart...

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,268
I'm sure we can work it out.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,710
Because we are the same...
We're Sailor Soldiers!

5
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:18,011
Even if we don't have the talismans,
we can save the world!

6
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:19,812
I'll show you.
I'll save the world!

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,161
So unfair of you...

8
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:59,331
...to go off into your own world.

9
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,833
Don't leave me here...

10
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:11,076
I saw... a dream this morning...

11
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:12,244
Yeah...

12
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:15,345
I feel it even after I'm fully awake...

13
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:17,049
I've never felt this way before...

14
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,682
You're right...

15
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,691
Then... You noticed it too...

16
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,690
Of course I noticed...

17
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:30,198
I'm sure of it...
Today, a talisman will appear...

18
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,684
This should allow me to specify
the owners of pure hearts...

19
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:51,054
...that have the talismans
hidden in them for sure.

20
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:58,395
Ouch!

21
00:01:58,431 --> 00:01:59,557
Ouch...

22
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:05,834
Who would do such a thing...?

23
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,335
That really hurt
because I was barefoot...

24
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:16,081
What's this?

25
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:27,190
What are the lab snails
doing in my locker...!?

26
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:33,556
Snail Woman in the Station Wagon
Should Crash and Die!!

27
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:39,503
Hey, did you hear?
Chief Eugeal failed again!

28
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:45,477
Oh, my... she made waste of yet another
Daimohn that we had the professor make us?

29
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:48,310
She's so calculating,
but she's more like Klutzeal.

30
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:52,014
Really... I would like
old hags to just retire.

31
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:56,182
You shouldn't say that, guys... Don't
say such bad things about our chief...

32
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:59,090
Maybe it's finally my turn next!

33
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,252
Sorry to break your bubble!

34
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:07,164
I got a phone call from the professor
today, saying he wanted to talk to me!

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,132
Not fair!

36
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:11,137
Why were you the only one to
get such a phone call, Mimet!?

37
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:23,277
Dammit... How dare they
Make such fun of me!

38
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:26,843
They forget exactly WHO
taught them their work...

39
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:29,888
Especially Mimet!

40
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:31,356
I can't forgive her!

41
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:34,887
She always acts so
cutesy in front of me...

42
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:37,260
She really has two different faces...

43
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:41,358
I'm sure SHE'S the one who
put the snails in my locker!

44
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:43,965
Fortunately, today is a holiday...

45
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,438
If I can resume work
with talisman in hand...

46
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:49,601
...the next executive
chair will be MINE...

47
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:54,171
And then, I'll show them... I'll make
sure they all suffer working for me!

48
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:55,648
All right!

49
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,775
This will allow me to
see who has a talisman!

50
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:07,285
But who in the world has the purest
heart to hide a talisman...!?

51
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:13,689
So this... is the
owner of a talisman...?

52
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:32,115
We're not home right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.

53
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:37,482
Hello, is this
Haruka Tenoh's residence?

54
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:42,552
This is Eugeal... I wanted to
thank you for all your hard work.

55
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:43,994
Are you surprised?

56
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,157
It's easy for me to
figure out where you are...

57
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,963
...now that you have shown
your true identities tome!

58
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:50,867
I'll surprise you even further!

59
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:54,567
I have finally found the
location of a talisman's owner!

60
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,576
I will go take it now!

61
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,510
The battle will be won by--

62
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:14,057
We're not home right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.

63
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,930
Hey, there cording time
on this is too short!

64
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:20,091
I couldn't finish
what I wanted to say!

65
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:24,270
Ah well... so there you have it.

66
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:27,865
Oh yeah, I hear that you've been
searching for talismans as well.

67
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:31,035
Depending on the conditions,
I can have you join us.

68
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:36,606
Don't worry. I haven't told my
boss of your true identities yet.

69
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:39,550
If you feel up to it, come to
the place I'm going to specify.

70
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:43,113
I'll send you a map via fax. See ya.

71
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:53,430
It's probably true that she
found the owner of a talisman.

72
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:56,128
Yeah, it coincides
with our premonition.

73
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:58,636
It's finally time...

74
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:12,882
The sehands have been tainted now...

75
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,616
No matter what methods I take
and what sacrifices I make...

76
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:20,649
I will make sure to get
a hold of the talismans...

77
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:23,352
Michiru?

78
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:42,439
Hey... what's wrong?

79
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,415
Haruka.

80
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,112
It's all right...

81
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:49,144
I like your hands.

82
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:59,993
Talismans... what in
the world are they?

83
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:03,469
Our objective is to get
a hold of the talismans.

84
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,107
Do you use any means
possible to get them?

85
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,976
That's right...
We use any means we can.

86
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,148
We... can't work this out...?

87
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:22,916
That's right...
We're going to be enemies...

88
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:29,151
But we're both the same...
We're Sailor Soldiers.

89
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:31,993
Stop that... We're looking
for completely different things.

90
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:42,530
We won't have any regrets,
no matter who we sacrifice...

91
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:47,512
Even if we have to sacrifice
the owners of those pure hearts...

92
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,242
Hey, idiot! Usagi! Telephone!

93
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:56,278
It's from someone named Haruka!

94
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,788
Eh? Usako was called out to go
somewhere by Haruka and Michiru?

95
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,556
Is she all right?

96
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,567
I mean, those two are
Uranus and Neptune, right...?

97
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,803
Yeah... but those two...

98
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,934
...aren't bad people, I think...

99
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:21,273
What's wrong?

100
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,633
This is amazing...

101
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:45,198
I didn't know there was an aquarium
at the top of this building!

102
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:47,638
Can I bring my friends here next time?

103
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:53,634
Can I?

104
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:01,979
Don't show yours elfin
front of us ever again...

105
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:04,751
...Sailor Moon.

106
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:09,286
We... are both the same...
We're Sailor Soldiers.

107
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:12,196
We can't fight together?

108
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:20,097
I won't allow you to slow us down
with your half-baked play war...

109
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:23,131
You can't!

110
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,342
I'll hold onto this...

111
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:30,749
Wait!

112
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:34,241
Please, don't go after
people's pure hearts anymore!

113
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:35,219
Don't say that.

114
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:39,156
Listen. The next time you show
yours elfin front of us...

115
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,651
...you will die!

116
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:45,460
URANUS PLANET POWER...

117
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:47,898
MAKE UP!

118
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:51,598
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

119
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:54,038
MAKE UP!

120
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:22,366
We are searching for the talismans
that are sealed inside pure hearts.

121
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:26,099
The Holy Grail will not appear unless we
collect all three talismans in one place.

122
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:30,098
Silence... a time of destruction is
approaching this world right now.

123
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:33,408
The only one who can save us is the
Messiah, the one who can use the Grail.

124
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,973
Grail? Messiah?

125
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,950
It has nothing to do with you...

126
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:50,922
Haruka! Michiru!

127
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,937
Will you go rescue them?

128
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:07,439
They have headed off to the place where
their destined battle will begin...

129
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:10,948
But today, even those
two are in danger.

130
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,213
You are...?

131
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:15,584
Setsuna Meioh.

132
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:18,715
An... old acquaintance... of those two.

133
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:21,050
Those two are in danger?

134
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:23,085
Will you go rescue them?

135
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:27,725
But you might see even graver danger,
as you are unable to transform...

136
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,967
Please! If you know where
I should go, tell me!

137
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,296
I can see it now...

138
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,198
So that's it...?

139
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:07,763
A church under construction.
A marine cathedral...

140
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:24,215
We'll finally meet
the owner of a talisman...

141
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:26,853
Uranus...

142
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,360
You understand...

143
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:32,421
...that no matter what happens,
we will acquire the talismans...

144
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:37,334
From here on, we'll ignore each other's
danger, and you'll move on by yourself.

145
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,736
What are you talking
about now, of all times?

146
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:41,737
You're right...

147
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:51,476
For someone who invited us,
this is rather unwelcome...

148
00:12:58,257 --> 00:12:59,986
What's wrong? Neptune?

149
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:07,493
It moved!?

150
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:08,397
Uranus!

151
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,137
So it was an enemy trap...

152
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:20,571
Idiot... of course it is.

153
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,871
Game...

154
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,577
START!

155
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,937
WORLD...

156
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:51,170
...SHAKING!

157
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,614
DEEP...

158
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,279
...SUBMERGE!

159
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:06,950
How's that?

160
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:11,391
URANUS!

161
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,802
Neptune!!

162
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,248
Sailor Uranus!

163
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:33,752
Now, I have the owner of a talisman!

164
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:35,083
What are you talking about!?

165
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:38,588
I really fell for it as well...

166
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:42,191
But then, not even
you had realized it...

167
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:43,354
What in the world
are you talking about!?

168
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:45,420
I'll tell you...

169
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:49,594
The owner of a talisman is
your partner, Sailor Neptune!

170
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,271
I will soon extract
the talisman from Neptune.

171
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:58,607
How do you feel about that? If you
want to watch, come to the main hall...

172
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:04,045
Neptune is the owner of a talisman!?

173
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,778
That's impossible!

174
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,101
Neptune...

175
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,367
NEPTUNE!!

176
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:39,475
You fell for it!

177
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:45,350
Fool, when someone other
than myself walks across...

178
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:47,985
...this bridge, they receive
divine punishment!!

179
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,989
Divine... punishment?

180
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:57,194
Don't worry. I haven't pulled
out Neptune's talisman yet...

181
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,761
I must pull the talisman out
of ANOTHER person first...

182
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,537
Another owner of a talisman!?

183
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,770
I mean, YOU!

184
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:08,509
I'm talking about your heart...

185
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:11,914
The one that tried to save the world,
without fear of soiling one's hands.

186
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:16,687
Uranus...

187
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:21,560
Talismans are sealed
within pure hearts...

188
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:23,755
There is no way I could
be holding a talisman...

189
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,696
You'll see soon enough...

190
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:30,191
Although with those wounds,
the force from this gun will kill you.

191
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,706
URANUS!

192
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:56,286
Haruka... I won't let you die...

193
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:58,819
Wait, Neptune!! Don't move!

194
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,673
NEPTUNE!

195
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,173
Haruka...

196
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,181
They're out of bullets.

197
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:00,725
So this is a talisman.
I'll take yours next!

198
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:05,493
We are the ones in whom
the talismans were sealed...

199
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:07,123
O Messiah...

200
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,795
Is this the punishment we get...?

201
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:13,228
Hold it right there!

202
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,708
Messiah...

203
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:25,038
You're...!

204
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,425
Drats!!

205
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:46,001
Hold yourself together, Michiru!

206
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:49,935
Please, talisman!
Turn back to Michiru's heart crystal!!

207
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,499
Please stop that...

208
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:55,645
We've found the talisman.
This is the way it should be...

209
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:56,841
Impossible!

210
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:58,509
Then, Michiru is...

211
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:03,385
You're so unfair, Michiru...

212
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:06,323
To leave for a world of your own...

213
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:10,529
I'll return that to you...

214
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:13,657
You really were reckless.
You knew you couldn't transform.

215
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,299
You can't!

216
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:18,166
- Let go!
- Stop that!

217
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:21,469
There is another talisman inside me!

218
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:24,670
Even if we don't have the talismans,
we can save the world!

219
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,438
What!?

220
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:29,108
I'll... save the world...

221
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:35,686
It's strange... when you say it,
it really feels like you will...

222
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:39,947
A few minutes ago... for some reason,
you looked like the Messiah...

223
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:44,294
...although I don't
believe in your powers...

224
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,389
Haruka...

225
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:50,626
Sailor Moon.

226
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:54,628
Please make sure to find
the last talisman, too...

227
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:56,402
Stop!!

228
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,927
This can't be...

229
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:26,097
Haruka... Michiru...

230
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:33,097
