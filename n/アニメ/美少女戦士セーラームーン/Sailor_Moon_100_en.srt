1
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:05,942
Minako was on
the volleyball team.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,611
And she had a
wonderful boyfriend!

3
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:12,887
You can't! The Daimohn is
after the pure heart...

4
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:15,588
...of an athlete who
sweats so healthily!

5
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:18,294
I, Sailor Moon...

6
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:20,994
...will punish you in
the name of the moon!

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,132
Matching clothing?!

8
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:30,468
There was a good outfit
at that store in Shibuya.

9
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:33,100
But isn't matching
clothing unfashionable?

10
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:35,110
It's REALLY unfashionable.

11
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:37,169
Oh, come on,
one outfit won't hurt.

12
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:39,738
Well, I guess it'll be a memory
of our days in junior high...

13
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:42,180
Once you start
looking for memorabilia...

14
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,242
...you won't
last much longer!

15
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:05,038
- What should we do today?
- Head straight to the library.

16
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:06,666
If we don't hurry,
the movie will start!

17
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,973
Don't tug me so much!

18
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:16,111
Go ahead,
show yourselves off!

19
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,345
Artemis...

20
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:22,380
I input all the data we've
gotten so far into our computer...

21
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,653
...but, unfortunately, we can't
figure out who the enemy is.

22
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,554
What in the world are
those unknown life-forms...

23
00:01:27,596 --> 00:01:29,564
...that fuse with a
material from this world...

24
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:31,964
...to become those monsters
known as Daimohn...?

25
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:37,302
Minako Aino. Ninth grade.

26
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:40,968
I feel doubts towards my
own life in this twilight...

27
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,446
What we lack the most
right now is information.

28
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:47,708
I lack something
completely different.

29
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:52,587
"One who looks at love
is looked at by love."

30
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:55,488
Which philosopher said that?

31
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:57,583
Nobody has ever
said such a thing.

32
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:01,522
Won't a handsome man
carrying a bouquet of roses...

33
00:02:01,564 --> 00:02:02,963
...suddenly approach me and say...

34
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,365
"Young lady, will you
spend an evening with me?"

35
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:09,098
Or something like that?

36
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:11,268
Nope... That won't happen.

37
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,709
When will I meet the
one destined for me...?

38
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:21,275
Sorry!

39
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,217
Oh. Asai...

40
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,085
Aino.

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,654
Thank you.

42
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:35,322
Asai, you still
play volleyball?

43
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,093
I want to do my best
until the summer tournament.

44
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,191
I want to win
at least once.

45
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:41,863
That'll also help me focus
on my entrance exams, too.

46
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:43,734
I see...

47
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,205
Yeah, you should
do your best!

48
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,536
Yeah.

49
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:52,236
You know...

50
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:57,952
Well, why'd you quit volleyball
after you came back from England?

51
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:05,851
Your flying, spinning
dig was pretty amazing.

52
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:11,790
And yet, you quit
so suddenly...

53
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:13,131
Yeah...

54
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:16,433
Actually, I wanted to
continue playing volleyball...

55
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,075
Hey, Asai!
Don't be ditching practice!

56
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,677
Sure!

57
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:30,912
Isn't our manager
a pesky one?

58
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:32,215
See ya!

59
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,949
Yeah, bye...

60
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,857
Mina-- No, nothing...

61
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:24,732
Professor, the tea is ready.

62
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,339
I tried baking
cookies today.

63
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:32,543
The tea is fine, Kaorinite...

64
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:35,742
...but haven't you located
the talismans we seek yet?

65
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:38,250
Not yet.

66
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:42,383
I don't want to say this,
but with these continual failures...

67
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:45,222
Perhaps your
approach is mistaken?

68
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,251
I apologize.

69
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:54,160
No good.
No good at all.

70
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:56,137
Because I've been
researching so much...

71
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,005
...I'm getting out of shape...
That's it, Kaorinite!

72
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:04,569
They say that a healthy spirit
resides in a healthy body.

73
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:07,309
That's it! An athlete!

74
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,341
How about a plan that
goes after a pure young heart...

75
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,284
...which has a passion for sports?

76
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:14,016
A wonderful idea.

77
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:20,386
I shall send a new
Daimohn now, then.

78
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:23,364
It's been a while. I should
go play some sports as well.

79
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,596
By the way, what is your
favorite sport, Professor?

80
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:28,626
Stair-stepping.

81
00:05:43,318 --> 00:05:45,752
- Hey.
- 'Morning.

82
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:50,788
You're unusually early for
someone who's always tardy.

83
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:52,919
I haven't been lately.

84
00:05:56,565 --> 00:06:00,057
So, Aino, do you have a
boyfriend or something?

85
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:01,964
Why?

86
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:04,336
Well, I was just
wondering if you did.

87
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:12,406
What kind of girls
do you like, Asai?

88
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:15,645
Me? I'm pretty
clear about that.

89
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:17,811
If I'm going to go out with a girl,
it'd be best if we could do...

90
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:20,321
...the same extracurricular
activities together.

91
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:24,582
You know, I...

92
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:26,255
What?

93
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,789
Well, I looked up to you a
lot when we were in 7th grade...

94
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,994
...because I was
always second-string...

95
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:35,595
...and you were already
the team's ace striker.

96
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:37,571
I was planning
to ask you out...

97
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,106
...when I made it to
the starting lineup.

98
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:46,213
Oh, that was a good one!

99
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:48,808
I see... Oh, I get it!

100
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:56,950
You're not going to
play volleyball anymore?

101
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:02,094
Well, we're in
9th grade now.

102
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,065
It doesn't matter that
we're in 9th grade.

103
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:08,365
Yeah... But I'm
pretty busy as is.

104
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:09,563
Studying?

105
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,539
Well, there's
a lot going on.

106
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:14,133
I see... That's a shame.

107
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,675
Well, I have morning
practice now.

108
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:48,736
Hey, Usagi.
Take a look at this!

109
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:50,142
Mamo-chan...

110
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:53,704
Right here! Where they talk
about the identity of Sailor V!

111
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,778
Oh, my...

112
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:57,842
See?

113
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,356
Isn't this beautiful face
under the mask amazing?!

114
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:03,853
But then, that's expected,
since this character...

115
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:05,860
...was based on ME!

116
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,860
What's wrong, guys?

117
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,528
You all look so
depressed today.

118
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,835
Come on, I bought these
Sailor V diet chocolates...

119
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,865
...and Sailor V vitamin
drinks for you guys!

120
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:22,467
Go on, eat up!

121
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:24,442
Yeah...

122
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:27,777
It says I won.

123
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:29,113
Congrats!

124
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:32,779
You can get a special Sailor V
badge with three winning tickets!

125
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:35,880
Oh, I see...
I'm pretty lucky.

126
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:37,289
Minako.

127
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,593
It looks like your studies
aren't going along well...

128
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:44,530
There it is, our teacher
Ami's best line!

129
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,592
Sorry, ma'am, but Minako,
the girl of love and justice...

130
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:50,104
...is actually a bad girl
who hates to study.

131
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,867
She cheats on tests
once in a while.

132
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,501
But she's totally all right!

133
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,818
Should I stop being a Sailor
Soldier for a while...?

134
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:13,327
Just kidding... A joke, a joke.

135
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:16,695
Sorry, I'm not feeling up to this
today, so I'll go home now.

136
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,097
Mina...

137
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,431
Artemis, take a look at this!

138
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,097
What is it?

139
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:25,130
Nothing.

140
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:28,468
Hey!

141
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,307
Idiot!

142
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:32,771
You really are as
stupid as a guppy!

143
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:35,305
Everyone has a time when
they want to be alone.

144
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:37,969
Take that, and that,
and that, and that!

145
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:44,985
Sheesh!

146
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,580
Yo.

147
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:49,954
Haruka...

148
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:52,516
What's wrong? Your rhythm
was off in your race today.

149
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,066
Haruka...
Do you have a boyfriend?

150
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,533
I don't.
I said that before.

151
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:05,335
But you do have someone
you like, right?

152
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:08,033
What kind of person does...

153
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:10,943
...a genius female racer
like you like, Haruka?

154
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:16,748
Would it really be a man
who has special talents?

155
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:21,149
What kind of an answer
are you looking for?

156
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,952
Don't you ever wish...

157
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:26,152
...you were a more...
average...schoolgirl?

158
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,193
Do you ever get lonely...

159
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,893
...because ordinary happiness
is so far away?

160
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:35,461
Are you sacrificing some
ordinary happiness right now?

161
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:38,466
No...

162
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:42,337
Let's see...

163
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:46,040
I'm not exactly sure what
"ordinary" happiness would be...

164
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:50,074
...but I don't think my
current self is "abnormal."

165
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:53,620
What I am now is what is
closest to my true self.

166
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,452
That's what I think.

167
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,288
Haruka Tenoh, who fell in
love with motor sports...

168
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:01,489
...can only live in this manner,
no matter what she does.

169
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:06,260
I have something more valuable
than "ordinary" happiness.

170
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,230
I guess.

171
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:10,696
Something more valuable...

172
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,402
I'm sorry.
I have to go now.

173
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,140
No, I'm sorry I asked
a strange question.

174
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,741
No... Minako, was it?

175
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,547
We should race together
at the Crown again.

176
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,110
See ya!

177
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,891
Something more valuable...

178
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:40,264
The sea is getting
stormy again...

179
00:12:57,586 --> 00:13:00,248
You're so cold!
You're going home by yourself?

180
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:02,279
I'm going ahead now!

181
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:06,320
You have to go out
with me on Sunday.

182
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:08,230
I know... See ya!

183
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,527
Yeah.

184
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,691
W-What is this?!

185
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:19,300
HIKYUN!

186
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:24,570
Everyone,
the enemy has appeared!

187
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:29,843
Venus Star Power, MAKE UP!

188
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:53,263
Look out!

189
00:13:58,146 --> 00:13:59,738
Hold it right there!

190
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,875
For love and beauty, the
pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

191
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,547
Sailor Venus!

192
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:08,021
In the name of Venus...

193
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,219
...I will have you through
divine intervention of love!

194
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,423
Don't get in my way!

195
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:24,036
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

196
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,738
Such a thing won't
work on Sailor Venus!

197
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:32,502
Oh, drat!

198
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:34,572
You touched the net!

199
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:38,875
Idiot.

200
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,980
If you weren't a sailor soldier,
you could have lived a long life.

201
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,995
I will take
that pure heart...

202
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,555
...which resides inside
your healthy body!

203
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,339
Asai!

204
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:05,670
No...
This isn't a talisman.

205
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,144
This was a wasted trip.

206
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:12,449
Hikyun, kill Sailor
Venus and that boy.

207
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:14,618
Venus...!

208
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:21,885
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

209
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,802
This is...

210
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:12,077
"Attack No. 1" for giving
villains what they deserve!

211
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,908
You only have one life, so you
should go as far as you can!

212
00:16:16,651 --> 00:16:19,984
For love and justice, the
pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

213
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:25,982
Sailor Moon!

214
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:31,262
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

215
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,525
Hikyun, get rid of her.

216
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:41,740
Sailor Moon, can you
crush this ball?

217
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,035
Sailor Moon, be careful!
Don't break that ball!

218
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:50,541
Then... What should I do?

219
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,348
Mars!

220
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,684
-NICE!
- And that's about it!

221
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:58,852
Everyone!

222
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,190
So cunning...

223
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:02,991
What?!

224
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:11,735
- No good...
- It's hard enough just dodging!

225
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:13,740
I can't possibly catch
something like that.

226
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:22,243
I'll take you on!
Daimohn, I challenge you!

227
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:31,958
SERVICE ACE!

228
00:17:31,993 --> 00:17:35,360
LIGHTNING...

229
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,334
...HI...KYUN!

230
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:46,233
I am a Sailor Soldier...

231
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,572
There's something
that only I can protect!

232
00:17:52,914 --> 00:17:54,506
Let's do it!

233
00:17:58,219 --> 00:17:59,550
What?!

234
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:03,347
That flying,
spinning receive...

235
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:08,453
I get it... Sailor Venus is...

236
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,867
Sailor Moon!

237
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:14,561
Right!

238
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:42,953
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

239
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:56,972
JAPAN, GO GO GO!

240
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:09,621
We did it!

241
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:10,589
That was amazing, Venus!

242
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,593
Nice receive!

243
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,958
We didn't have
much to do today.

244
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,859
Yeah...

245
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:19,622
YEAH!

246
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,271
No... We should go to
a concert on Sunday.

247
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:27,467
But we can't
change plans now!

248
00:19:27,976 --> 00:19:29,034
Aino...

249
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:30,544
Hey!

250
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,879
You know...

251
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:38,251
If... If you were able to
meet Sailor Venus somewhere...

252
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:42,188
...could you tell her
thanks for saving me?

253
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,416
What's that?

254
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:48,985
Well, if I see her,
I'll make sure to tell her.

255
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:52,159
Let's go.

256
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,293
Yeah... See ya.

257
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:01,708
Young lady!

258
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:10,747
Will you spend an evening
together with me?

259
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:25,131
Well, I'll consider that offer.

260
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,997
Oh, man...

261
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:33,997
