00:01.982 --> 00:05.679
Dear Usagi, how are
you feeling lately?

00:05.719 --> 00:08.984
I'm so jealous...
I want to see Mamo-chan, too...

00:09.022 --> 00:11.490
Yup, I decided to go back there!

00:11.525 --> 00:13.891
See ya. From Chibiusa.

00:13.927 --> 00:15.690
What IS this!?

00:15.729 --> 00:20.393
Such a selfish little daughter will
be punished in the name of the moon!

01:04.300 --> 01:06.860
Yes, this is the Witches 5...

01:06.902 --> 01:09.928
Yes, please hold on a moment.

01:11.707 --> 01:13.641
Yes, this is Eugeal.

01:13.676 --> 01:14.802
It's me.

01:14.844 --> 01:17.335
I have looked through your reports...

01:17.379 --> 01:19.313
How were they?

01:19.715 --> 01:21.080
They are rather well done.

01:21.116 --> 01:22.811
Thank you very much.

01:23.552 --> 01:26.077
I've already found yet another
person with a pure heart...

01:26.121 --> 01:28.487
...our next candidate
for the talisman.

01:28.524 --> 01:30.822
Nothing less from you, Eugeal.

01:37.566 --> 01:40.831
Our target is a girl famous for
her skills with the Japanese drum.

01:41.503 --> 01:44.734
I believe that this girl's
pure heart is a talisman.

01:44.773 --> 01:46.798
Yes. I am trusting you with this...

01:46.842 --> 01:51.336
I guess we should alter our methods
from now on, as per your reports.

01:51.947 --> 01:57.249
I will assign a Daimohn befitting
this target as your bodyguard...

02:23.078 --> 02:26.514
SOYER!

03:00.082 --> 03:01.549
Hey, hey! Guys!

03:01.583 --> 03:04.746
Why don't we all go to
the Juban Festival tonight?

03:04.787 --> 03:06.049
Oh, that's a good idea!

03:06.088 --> 03:07.055
Don't you think so?

03:07.089 --> 03:09.785
Then we can all look sharp
in our summer kimonos...

03:09.825 --> 03:11.520
- Yup, yup! Yup, yup!
- Yup, yup! Yup, yup!

03:12.594 --> 03:16.325
Ami, it's all right if we take
a small breather today... right?

03:16.365 --> 03:20.699
Yeah, yeah! Our study group
already was canceled for today...

03:21.637 --> 03:23.537
I guess so...

03:23.572 --> 03:25.563
Taking it easy once in
a while can be a good thing.

03:25.607 --> 03:27.097
Yippee!

03:28.243 --> 03:31.235
But anyway, I wonder
what's up with Rei...

03:31.280 --> 03:35.216
Why did she want to cancel the study
group at the Hikawa Shrine today...?

03:36.385 --> 03:37.943
I wonder if something happened...

03:56.138 --> 03:57.036
It's Rei...

03:57.072 --> 03:58.004
Sure is...

03:58.574 --> 04:00.098
Oh, Miss Hino!

04:00.142 --> 04:02.838
I'm sorry that I'm so late!

04:02.878 --> 04:06.575
It's all right.
I just got here myself...

04:15.424 --> 04:16.891
It's a girl...

04:16.925 --> 04:20.361
Who said that it HAD to be a date...?

04:20.396 --> 04:24.025
You can't tell from just appearances.
There are cases like Haruka, you know.

04:24.066 --> 04:28.400
Then, she's the opposite of Haruka, and
is actually a guy dressing up as a girl!?

04:28.437 --> 04:30.428
It sure doesn't look that way...

04:31.707 --> 04:35.438
I have no idea what they
are talking about from here.

04:35.477 --> 04:37.138
Um...

04:37.179 --> 04:38.612
How is it?

04:38.647 --> 04:40.512
Well... Let's see...

04:40.549 --> 04:43.985
Please! You just HAVE
to help us, Miss Tohno...

04:44.019 --> 04:47.182
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Who ordered the house blend?

04:47.222 --> 04:48.189
Oh, I did.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.500
M-Miss?

05:07.543 --> 05:10.137
Was it just me...?

05:15.050 --> 05:16.711
Miss?

05:21.657 --> 05:23.989
Miss...

05:33.068 --> 05:36.162
Hot! HOT!!

05:36.205 --> 05:38.105
My head, my head!

05:38.140 --> 05:40.472
Why in the world are all of YOU here!?

05:40.509 --> 05:42.101
Miss Hino...

05:42.144 --> 05:43.975
Yes?

05:44.012 --> 05:46.503
That offer of yours...
I will accept it.

05:46.548 --> 05:48.140
Really!?

05:48.183 --> 05:49.172
Yes...

05:49.218 --> 05:50.515
It'd be my pleasure.

05:52.154 --> 05:56.147
Oh, no, the pleasure is all mine.

06:06.435 --> 06:09.495
Juban Festival Promotion Committee?

06:09.538 --> 06:10.630
What's that?

06:10.672 --> 06:12.037
Just like it says.

06:12.074 --> 06:14.770
It's a group of people trying to make
the festival a little bit more exciting.

06:14.810 --> 06:17.506
I take it that you're a member
of this committee, Rei.

06:17.546 --> 06:19.377
But why you, Rei?

06:19.414 --> 06:23.510
One of Grandpa's friends
begged me into doing it.

06:23.552 --> 06:28.046
Sure, that's what you say,
but I'm sure you volunteered to do it!

06:28.090 --> 06:30.820
Rei, you like festivals and stuff!

06:30.859 --> 06:32.349
Like what just happened...

06:32.394 --> 06:34.919
You guys caused all that!

06:35.130 --> 06:38.691
Now, now...
Mistakes happen to everyone.

06:38.734 --> 06:41.931
They say that water-goblins
get upset stomachs.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.933
You mean, "Even water-goblins
drown in the river."

06:49.645 --> 06:52.341
I'm just glad Miss Tohno
is a kind person.

06:52.381 --> 06:54.281
Who was that girl?

06:54.316 --> 06:55.908
Now listen up!

06:55.951 --> 06:58.511
That was Miss Maya Tohno.

06:58.554 --> 07:00.988
She's an prodigious player
of the Japanese drums!

07:01.023 --> 07:02.615
Japanese drums...

07:02.658 --> 07:04.888
In other words, Rei --
you were negotiating...

07:04.927 --> 07:07.122
...with her to come play
for the Juban Festival.

07:07.362 --> 07:10.490
Correct! If Miss Tohno could
beat the drums for us...

07:10.532 --> 07:14.161
The Juban Festival
would be more exciting.

07:14.203 --> 07:15.670
Hey, Rei...

07:15.704 --> 07:17.569
Let me beat on the drum too!

07:17.606 --> 07:21.838
There isn't a drum that
you can beat on, Usagi.

07:21.877 --> 07:23.003
Oh, wait...

07:23.045 --> 07:25.707
Usagi, there IS one drum
that even you can beat on.

07:25.747 --> 07:26.941
Really!?

07:41.997 --> 07:45.956
Goldfish! How about
scooping for goldfish!?

07:46.134 --> 07:49.831
Goldfish! It's the goldfish scoop!

07:52.241 --> 07:56.473
Why do we have to watch over
the goldfish scooping booth...?

07:56.678 --> 07:59.875
That drum looks pretty
good on you, Usagi.

07:59.915 --> 08:01.780
Then change places with me.

08:01.817 --> 08:03.079
I'll pass.

08:03.118 --> 08:06.986
Usagi, you said that you
wanted to beat on the drums.

08:08.824 --> 08:09.483
Yeah...

08:09.524 --> 08:10.923
This one looks strong.

08:10.959 --> 08:11.948
Thanks!

08:11.994 --> 08:12.983
See...

08:13.996 --> 08:16.590
Be gentle...

08:17.966 --> 08:21.231
You two...
You're ruining the business...

08:21.270 --> 08:22.931
Missus!

08:22.971 --> 08:24.563
We'll try scooping goldfish!

08:24.606 --> 08:25.664
Can you give us scoops?

08:25.707 --> 08:28.642
We're customers! Customers!

08:28.677 --> 08:30.611
Missus... huh?

08:32.981 --> 08:34.881
Here you go!

08:41.156 --> 08:42.384
Business, business...

08:42.791 --> 08:44.725
Goldfish!

08:44.760 --> 08:46.125
Goldfish!

08:46.161 --> 08:47.628
Buns-head?

08:58.273 --> 08:59.297
Haruka!

08:59.341 --> 09:01.639
Michiru!

09:01.977 --> 09:03.137
Good evening.

09:03.178 --> 09:05.442
What's this? Are all of
you on a part-time job?

09:05.480 --> 09:06.811
Well... I guess...

09:06.848 --> 09:10.215
I know, why don't you two
try scooping some goldfish?

09:10.252 --> 09:11.981
Try the goldfish scoop!

09:12.020 --> 09:14.352
All right... just a little bit.

09:14.389 --> 09:15.321
I guess so...

09:15.357 --> 09:16.551
Please, please!

09:28.603 --> 09:29.535
Yeah...

09:29.571 --> 09:31.766
Aren't you glad we
got a cute goldfish...?

09:31.807 --> 09:34.275
Oh? Cute...?

09:34.676 --> 09:37.975
What, are you jealous?

09:38.013 --> 09:40.447
Perhaps...

09:41.983 --> 09:44.713
They look so sharp,
no matter what they do!

09:44.753 --> 09:46.812
All right!
I'll try it out once myseIf!

09:55.364 --> 09:58.333
Huh? Was it just me?

10:28.330 --> 10:29.854
There she is...

10:36.304 --> 10:37.100
Rei!

10:37.773 --> 10:38.603
Usagi...

10:38.640 --> 10:42.201
Rei, how much longer do we
have to watch over the booth--

10:51.520 --> 10:54.045
Miss Tohno?

10:58.994 --> 10:59.961
Miss Tohno...

10:59.995 --> 11:04.056
...has been practicing like
that for the past three hours!

11:04.099 --> 11:06.567
I told her that she didn't
have to go that far...

11:06.601 --> 11:08.899
...because we're not paying
her for this performance...

11:09.104 --> 11:12.232
But she said that she can't
beat the drum right...

11:12.274 --> 11:14.765
...unless she gets excited
by practicing like that.

11:29.958 --> 11:32.756
I thought about it when
I saw Miss Tohno's drumming...

11:32.794 --> 11:38.426
...that the Juban festival is sure to
be a success if she participates in it.

11:38.633 --> 11:39.759
But I...

11:39.801 --> 11:42.929
...I guess I was a little
too unfair about it.

11:43.238 --> 11:47.868
Even amazing people like Miss Tohno
work so hard behind the scenes...

11:47.909 --> 11:49.206
Rei...

11:49.244 --> 11:51.838
I have to do MY best to
make the festival more fun!

11:51.880 --> 11:52.938
Yeah!

11:54.249 --> 11:57.275
Let's crank up the fun factor,
and surprise everyone!

11:57.319 --> 12:00.015
All right, we're going to
make sure this is a blast!

12:00.055 --> 12:02.285
Yeah!

12:12.400 --> 12:16.268
I have received information that
the target is in this vicinity...

12:16.304 --> 12:18.829
I guess I have no choice...
I'll call out for her.

12:21.476 --> 12:25.105
Um, um... Test, test, test...

12:25.146 --> 12:27.341
What's that car?

12:28.250 --> 12:32.914
Miss Maya Tohno. Miss Maya Tohno,
please show yourself if you are here.

12:32.954 --> 12:37.584
Miss Maya Tohno. Miss Maya Tohno,
please show yourself if you are here.

12:42.831 --> 12:43.820
There she is!

12:55.477 --> 12:56.569
Captured!

13:04.019 --> 13:05.987
Miss Tohno's heart crystal...!

13:06.021 --> 13:07.579
Let's transform!

13:07.622 --> 13:08.350
Yeah!

13:10.458 --> 13:13.586
MOON COSMIC POWER...

13:13.628 --> 13:16.153
...MAKE UP!

13:47.128 --> 13:49.892
MARS STAR POWER...

13:49.931 --> 13:52.456
...MAKE UP!

14:09.784 --> 14:11.979
I will now go ahead
and take the crystal...

14:12.020 --> 14:13.282
Hold it right there!

14:14.022 --> 14:17.423
Those who are after the pure heart
devoted to the Japanese drum...

14:17.459 --> 14:19.791
....are all enemies of the
Japanese traditional arts!

14:20.128 --> 14:21.595
For love and justice...

14:21.630 --> 14:23.791
The pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

14:28.136 --> 14:29.797
Sailor Moon!

14:31.706 --> 14:35.039
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

14:35.477 --> 14:36.341
Just as she said...

14:36.378 --> 14:40.007
For love and fire,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

14:41.082 --> 14:43.016
Sailor Mars!

14:43.051 --> 14:46.543
I'll chastise you in the name of Mars!

14:46.821 --> 14:47.810
I see...

14:47.856 --> 14:50.825
So you are the Sailor Soldiers...

14:52.060 --> 14:54.051
I am one of the Witches 5.

14:54.095 --> 14:55.084
I am Eugeal!

14:55.130 --> 14:56.392
Witches 5?

14:56.431 --> 14:58.399
Eugeal?

14:58.433 --> 15:01.561
Appear before me, Daimohn!

15:16.084 --> 15:17.642
Soyer!

15:19.120 --> 15:22.283
Get rid of those that get in our way!

15:43.912 --> 15:45.675
You gotta dance!

15:51.319 --> 15:54.447
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Uranus...

15:54.489 --> 15:56.855
...acts with elegance!

15:57.959 --> 16:00.655
Also guided by a new era,
Sailor Neptune...

16:00.695 --> 16:02.856
...acts with grace!

16:03.765 --> 16:07.064
Hey! Don't you dare touch MY
crystal without my permission!

16:07.102 --> 16:10.094
I know this is your all-important first
battle, but it looks like a loss for you.

16:10.138 --> 16:11.105
What?!

16:11.139 --> 16:12.367
Too bad.

16:12.407 --> 16:15.103
This isn't a talisman...

16:18.780 --> 16:19.747
Dammit!

16:19.781 --> 16:20.611
Soyer!

16:20.648 --> 16:24.277
I'm trusting you to
take care of the rest!

16:29.057 --> 16:31.048
You're not going to help them today?

16:31.092 --> 16:34.255
If I help them every time, I would be
providing them with too much support...

16:34.295 --> 16:35.626
That's true.

16:47.909 --> 16:49.877
Now, I think it is about time...

16:49.911 --> 16:50.969
...to beat on this drum!

16:52.680 --> 16:54.307
By a drum...

16:54.349 --> 16:55.976
...do you mean US?

17:00.155 --> 17:02.248
Here we go!

17:03.825 --> 17:06.123
Please, try her out first!

17:06.161 --> 17:07.458
What are you saying!?

17:07.495 --> 17:10.259
Because that looks like it'll HURT!

17:11.833 --> 17:13.494
Hold it right there!

17:14.903 --> 17:16.336
Who is it this time!?

17:18.907 --> 17:21.967
You really are worthless without me!

17:22.010 --> 17:24.706
You should really
hold yourself together!

17:24.746 --> 17:26.839
T-That voice...

17:29.717 --> 17:33.710
For love and justice, an apprentice
to a pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

17:33.755 --> 17:36.315
Sailor Chibi Moon!

17:36.357 --> 17:38.848
In the name of the moon
from the future...

17:38.893 --> 17:41.123
...I'll punish you!

17:42.831 --> 17:44.093
Chibiusa?

17:44.132 --> 17:46.862
All right! I'll get rid of YOU first!

17:49.504 --> 17:51.699
PINK SUGAR...

17:51.739 --> 17:55.675
...HEART ATTACK!

18:04.419 --> 18:07.252
That's strange...

18:09.457 --> 18:11.755
Ouch...

18:11.793 --> 18:13.158
What's the matter?

18:13.928 --> 18:15.259
PINK SUGAR...

18:15.296 --> 18:18.094
...HEART ATTACK!

18:22.170 --> 18:24.468
There!

18:37.018 --> 18:38.280
Now, Sailor Moon!

18:59.040 --> 19:02.703
MOON SPIRAL...

19:02.744 --> 19:07.204
...HEART ATTACK!

19:17.825 --> 19:20.157
LOVELY!

19:41.115 --> 19:44.642
Usagi! I can't see well!
Do something about it!

19:44.686 --> 19:47.678
You sure have an attitude for
someone getting a piggyback ride!

19:48.723 --> 19:50.418
Oh, she's a cute girl...

19:50.458 --> 19:52.756
Oh, thanks...

19:52.794 --> 19:55.524
That girl... Don't you think
she looks like you, buns-head?

19:55.563 --> 19:57.190
We don't look alike at all!

19:57.231 --> 19:59.358
She's just my cousin.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.833
Everyone!

20:01.102 --> 20:05.402
We would now like to start Miss Maya
Tohno's Japanese drum performance.

20:05.440 --> 20:08.102
Miss Tohno, please go ahead.

20:14.782 --> 20:18.741
By the way, Chibiusa...
Why did you come back over here?

20:18.786 --> 20:23.189
My mom told me to get some
training in the 20th century.

20:23.858 --> 20:27.225
What does that mean!?

20:30.225 --> 20:34.225
