WEBVTT

00:03.417 --> 00:05.942
Minako was on
the volleyball team.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.611
And she had a
wonderful boyfriend!

00:10.657 --> 00:12.887
You can't! The Daimohn is
after the pure heart...

00:12.926 --> 00:15.588
...of an athlete who
sweats so healthily!

00:15.962 --> 00:18.294
I, Sailor Moon...

00:18.332 --> 00:20.994
...will punish you in
the name of the moon!

00:24.800 --> 00:27.132
Matching clothing?!

00:27.169 --> 00:30.468
There was a good outfit
at that store in Shibuya.

00:30.506 --> 00:33.100
But isn't matching
clothing unfashionable?

00:33.142 --> 00:35.110
It's REALLY unfashionable.

00:35.144 --> 00:37.169
Oh, come on,
one outfit won't hurt.

00:37.213 --> 00:39.738
Well, I guess it'll be a memory
of our days in junior high...

00:40.349 --> 00:42.180
Once you start
looking for memorabilia...

00:42.251 --> 00:44.242
...you won't
last much longer!

01:02.171 --> 01:05.038
- What should we do today?
- Head straight to the library.

01:05.074 --> 01:06.666
If we don't hurry,
the movie will start!

01:06.709 --> 01:08.973
Don't tug me so much!

01:13.415 --> 01:16.111
Go ahead,
show yourselves off!

01:17.219 --> 01:18.345
Artemis...

01:18.387 --> 01:22.380
I input all the data we've
gotten so far into our computer...

01:22.458 --> 01:24.653
...but, unfortunately, we can't
figure out who the enemy is.

01:25.461 --> 01:27.554
What in the world are
those unknown life-forms...

01:27.596 --> 01:29.564
...that fuse with a
material from this world...

01:29.598 --> 01:31.964
...to become those monsters
known as Daimohn...?

01:35.004 --> 01:37.302
Minako Aino. Ninth grade.

01:37.339 --> 01:40.968
I feel doubts towards my
own life in this twilight...

01:41.010 --> 01:44.446
What we lack the most
right now is information.

01:45.114 --> 01:47.708
I lack something
completely different.

01:49.652 --> 01:52.587
"One who looks at love
is looked at by love."

01:52.621 --> 01:55.488
Which philosopher said that?

01:55.524 --> 01:57.583
Nobody has ever
said such a thing.

01:59.395 --> 02:01.522
Won't a handsome man
carrying a bouquet of roses...

02:01.564 --> 02:02.963
...suddenly approach me and say...

02:02.998 --> 02:06.365
"Young lady, will you
spend an evening with me?"

02:06.402 --> 02:09.098
Or something like that?

02:09.471 --> 02:11.268
Nope... That won't happen.

02:11.340 --> 02:15.709
When will I meet the
one destined for me...?

02:19.648 --> 02:21.275
Sorry!

02:21.317 --> 02:23.217
Oh. Asai...

02:28.390 --> 02:30.085
Aino.

02:31.460 --> 02:32.654
Thank you.

02:32.728 --> 02:35.322
Asai, you still
play volleyball?

02:35.364 --> 02:37.093
I want to do my best
until the summer tournament.

02:37.166 --> 02:39.191
I want to win
at least once.

02:39.235 --> 02:41.863
That'll also help me focus
on my entrance exams, too.

02:41.937 --> 02:43.734
I see...

02:43.772 --> 02:45.205
Yeah, you should
do your best!

02:45.274 --> 02:46.536
Yeah.

02:50.746 --> 02:52.236
You know...

02:53.515 --> 02:57.952
Well, why'd you quit volleyball
after you came back from England?

03:01.824 --> 03:05.851
Your flying, spinning
dig was pretty amazing.

03:09.765 --> 03:11.790
And yet, you quit
so suddenly...

03:11.834 --> 03:13.131
Yeah...

03:13.168 --> 03:16.433
Actually, I wanted to
continue playing volleyball...

03:22.878 --> 03:26.075
Hey, Asai!
Don't be ditching practice!

03:27.449 --> 03:28.677
Sure!

03:28.717 --> 03:30.912
Isn't our manager
a pesky one?

03:30.953 --> 03:32.215
See ya!

03:32.254 --> 03:33.949
Yeah, bye...

03:36.625 --> 03:40.857
Mina-- No, nothing...

04:22.104 --> 04:24.732
Professor, the tea is ready.

04:26.075 --> 04:28.339
I tried baking
cookies today.

04:29.745 --> 04:32.543
The tea is fine, Kaorinite...

04:32.614 --> 04:35.742
...but haven't you located
the talismans we seek yet?

04:36.885 --> 04:38.250
Not yet.

04:38.287 --> 04:42.383
I don't want to say this,
but with these continual failures...

04:42.424 --> 04:45.222
Perhaps your
approach is mistaken?

04:45.260 --> 04:47.251
I apologize.

04:52.101 --> 04:54.160
No good.
No good at all.

04:54.203 --> 04:56.137
Because I've been
researching so much...

04:56.171 --> 05:00.005
...I'm getting out of shape...
That's it, Kaorinite!

05:00.075 --> 05:04.569
They say that a healthy spirit
resides in a healthy body.

05:04.613 --> 05:07.309
That's it! An athlete!

05:07.349 --> 05:10.341
How about a plan that
goes after a pure young heart...

05:10.419 --> 05:12.284
...which has a passion for sports?

05:12.321 --> 05:14.016
A wonderful idea.

05:16.859 --> 05:20.386
I shall send a new
Daimohn now, then.

05:20.429 --> 05:23.364
It's been a while. I should
go play some sports as well.

05:23.399 --> 05:26.596
By the way, what is your
favorite sport, Professor?

05:26.635 --> 05:28.626
Stair-stepping.

05:43.318 --> 05:45.752
- Hey.
- 'Morning.

05:47.523 --> 05:50.788
You're unusually early for
someone who's always tardy.

05:50.826 --> 05:52.919
I haven't been lately.

05:56.565 --> 06:00.057
So, Aino, do you have a
boyfriend or something?

06:00.736 --> 06:01.964
Why?

06:02.004 --> 06:04.336
Well, I was just
wondering if you did.

06:09.778 --> 06:12.406
What kind of girls
do you like, Asai?

06:12.448 --> 06:15.645
Me? I'm pretty
clear about that.

06:15.684 --> 06:17.811
If I'm going to go out with a girl,
it'd be best if we could do...

06:17.853 --> 06:20.321
...the same extracurricular
activities together.

06:23.058 --> 06:24.582
You know, I...

06:25.027 --> 06:26.255
What?

06:27.262 --> 06:30.789
Well, I looked up to you a
lot when we were in 7th grade...

06:30.833 --> 06:32.994
...because I was
always second-string...

06:33.035 --> 06:35.595
...and you were already
the team's ace striker.

06:35.637 --> 06:37.571
I was planning
to ask you out...

06:37.639 --> 06:39.106
...when I made it to
the starting lineup.

06:43.745 --> 06:46.213
Oh, that was a good one!

06:46.248 --> 06:48.808
I see... Oh, I get it!

06:54.356 --> 06:56.950
You're not going to
play volleyball anymore?

06:59.261 --> 07:02.094
Well, we're in
9th grade now.

07:02.131 --> 07:04.065
It doesn't matter that
we're in 9th grade.

07:04.133 --> 07:08.365
Yeah... But I'm
pretty busy as is.

07:08.403 --> 07:09.563
Studying?

07:09.605 --> 07:11.539
Well, there's
a lot going on.

07:11.573 --> 07:14.133
I see... That's a shame.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.675
Well, I have morning
practice now.

07:46.108 --> 07:48.736
Hey, Usagi.
Take a look at this!

07:48.777 --> 07:50.142
Mamo-chan...

07:50.212 --> 07:53.704
Right here! Where they talk
about the identity of Sailor V!

07:55.083 --> 07:56.778
Oh, my...

07:56.818 --> 07:57.842
See?

07:57.920 --> 08:01.356
Isn't this beautiful face
under the mask amazing?!

08:01.623 --> 08:03.853
But then, that's expected,
since this character...

08:03.892 --> 08:05.860
...was based on ME!

08:11.233 --> 08:12.860
What's wrong, guys?

08:12.901 --> 08:14.528
You all look so
depressed today.

08:14.570 --> 08:17.835
Come on, I bought these
Sailor V diet chocolates...

08:17.873 --> 08:20.865
...and Sailor V vitamin
drinks for you guys!

08:20.943 --> 08:22.467
Go on, eat up!

08:23.145 --> 08:24.442
Yeah...

08:26.515 --> 08:27.777
It says I won.

08:27.816 --> 08:29.113
Congrats!

08:29.184 --> 08:32.779
You can get a special Sailor V
badge with three winning tickets!

08:33.355 --> 08:35.880
Oh, I see...
I'm pretty lucky.

08:35.924 --> 08:37.289
Minako.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.593
It looks like your studies
aren't going along well...

08:41.663 --> 08:44.530
There it is, our teacher
Ami's best line!

08:44.566 --> 08:47.592
Sorry, ma'am, but Minako,
the girl of love and justice...

08:47.636 --> 08:50.104
...is actually a bad girl
who hates to study.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.867
She cheats on tests
once in a while.

08:51.907 --> 08:54.501
But she's totally all right!

09:01.917 --> 09:04.818
Should I stop being a Sailor
Soldier for a while...?

09:10.392 --> 09:13.327
Just kidding... A joke, a joke.

09:13.362 --> 09:16.695
Sorry, I'm not feeling up to this
today, so I'll go home now.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.097
Mina...

09:19.167 --> 09:21.431
Artemis, take a look at this!

09:21.470 --> 09:23.097
What is it?

09:23.538 --> 09:25.130
Nothing.

09:27.376 --> 09:28.468
Hey!

09:28.510 --> 09:30.307
Idiot!

09:30.712 --> 09:32.771
You really are as
stupid as a guppy!

09:32.814 --> 09:35.305
Everyone has a time when
they want to be alone.

10:33.942 --> 10:37.969
Take that, and that,
and that, and that!

10:43.552 --> 10:44.985
Sheesh!

10:47.022 --> 10:48.580
Yo.

10:48.657 --> 10:49.954
Haruka...

10:49.991 --> 10:52.516
What's wrong? Your rhythm
was off in your race today.

10:57.666 --> 11:00.066
Haruka...
Do you have a boyfriend?

11:00.702 --> 11:02.533
I don't.
I said that before.

11:02.571 --> 11:05.335
But you do have someone
you like, right?

11:06.475 --> 11:08.033
What kind of person does...

11:08.076 --> 11:10.943
...a genius female racer
like you like, Haruka?

11:12.948 --> 11:16.748
Would it really be a man
who has special talents?

11:18.954 --> 11:21.149
What kind of an answer
are you looking for?

11:21.223 --> 11:22.952
Don't you ever wish...

11:23.024 --> 11:26.152
...you were a more...
average...schoolgirl?

11:27.396 --> 11:29.193
Do you ever get lonely...

11:29.231 --> 11:31.893
...because ordinary happiness
is so far away?

11:32.367 --> 11:35.461
Are you sacrificing some
ordinary happiness right now?

11:37.272 --> 11:38.466
No...

11:41.109 --> 11:42.337
Let's see...

11:42.377 --> 11:46.040
I'm not exactly sure what
"ordinary" happiness would be...

11:46.081 --> 11:50.074
...but I don't think my
current self is "abnormal."

11:50.719 --> 11:53.620
What I am now is what is
closest to my true self.

11:53.655 --> 11:55.452
That's what I think.

11:55.490 --> 11:58.288
Haruka Tenoh, who fell in
love with motor sports...

11:58.326 --> 12:01.489
...can only live in this manner,
no matter what she does.

12:02.164 --> 12:06.260
I have something more valuable
than "ordinary" happiness.

12:06.535 --> 12:08.230
I guess.

12:08.637 --> 12:10.696
Something more valuable...

12:12.774 --> 12:15.402
I'm sorry.
I have to go now.

12:15.444 --> 12:18.140
No, I'm sorry I asked
a strange question.

12:18.180 --> 12:21.741
No... Minako, was it?

12:21.783 --> 12:24.547
We should race together
at the Crown again.

12:24.586 --> 12:26.110
See ya!

12:28.457 --> 12:30.891
Something more valuable...

12:38.433 --> 12:40.264
The sea is getting
stormy again...

12:57.586 --> 13:00.248
You're so cold!
You're going home by yourself?

13:00.288 --> 13:02.279
I'm going ahead now!

13:04.693 --> 13:06.320
You have to go out
with me on Sunday.

13:06.361 --> 13:08.230
I know... See ya!

13:08.230 --> 13:09.527
Yeah.

13:12.133 --> 13:13.691
W-What is this?!

13:16.638 --> 13:19.300
HIKYUN!

13:22.978 --> 13:24.570
Everyone,
the enemy has appeared!

13:25.247 --> 13:29.843
Venus Star Power, MAKE UP!

13:52.274 --> 13:53.263
Look out!

13:58.146 --> 13:59.738
Hold it right there!

14:01.883 --> 14:04.875
For love and beauty, the
pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

14:04.920 --> 14:06.547
Sailor Venus!

14:06.588 --> 14:08.021
In the name of Venus...

14:08.056 --> 14:11.219
...I will have you through
divine intervention of love!

14:11.660 --> 14:13.423
Don't get in my way!

14:20.168 --> 14:24.036
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

14:26.541 --> 14:29.738
Such a thing won't
work on Sailor Venus!

14:31.513 --> 14:32.502
Oh, drat!

14:32.547 --> 14:34.572
You touched the net!

14:37.886 --> 14:38.875
Idiot.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.980
If you weren't a sailor soldier,
you could have lived a long life.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.995
I will take
that pure heart...

14:49.030 --> 14:51.555
...which resides inside
your healthy body!

15:00.008 --> 15:01.339
Asai!

15:03.645 --> 15:05.670
No...
This isn't a talisman.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.144
This was a wasted trip.

15:09.184 --> 15:12.449
Hikyun, kill Sailor
Venus and that boy.

15:13.788 --> 15:14.618
Venus...!

15:16.925 --> 15:21.885
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

16:03.505 --> 16:04.802
This is...

16:08.243 --> 16:12.077
"Attack No. 1" for giving
villains what they deserve!

16:12.347 --> 16:15.908
You only have one life, so you
should go as far as you can!

16:16.651 --> 16:19.984
For love and justice, the
pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

16:24.492 --> 16:25.982
Sailor Moon!

16:27.929 --> 16:31.262
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

16:32.500 --> 16:34.525
Hikyun, get rid of her.

16:38.907 --> 16:41.740
Sailor Moon, can you
crush this ball?

16:42.043 --> 16:45.035
Sailor Moon, be careful!
Don't break that ball!

16:49.017 --> 16:50.541
Then... What should I do?

16:52.120 --> 16:53.348
Mars!

16:55.056 --> 16:57.684
-NICE!
- And that's about it!

16:57.726 --> 16:58.852
Everyone!

16:58.893 --> 17:00.190
So cunning...

17:02.263 --> 17:02.991
What?!

17:09.437 --> 17:11.735
- No good...
- It's hard enough just dodging!

17:11.806 --> 17:13.740
I can't possibly catch
something like that.

17:19.547 --> 17:22.243
I'll take you on!
Daimohn, I challenge you!

17:30.525 --> 17:31.958
SERVICE ACE!

17:31.993 --> 17:35.360
LIGHTNING...

17:35.930 --> 17:41.334
...HI...KYUN!

17:44.572 --> 17:46.233
I am a Sailor Soldier...

17:46.274 --> 17:48.572
There's something
that only I can protect!

17:52.914 --> 17:54.506
Let's do it!

17:58.219 --> 17:59.550
What?!

18:01.322 --> 18:03.347
That flying,
spinning receive...

18:05.393 --> 18:08.453
I get it... Sailor Venus is...

18:12.400 --> 18:13.867
Sailor Moon!

18:13.902 --> 18:14.561
Right!

18:34.989 --> 18:42.953
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

18:52.774 --> 18:56.972
JAPAN, GO GO GO!

19:08.723 --> 19:09.621
We did it!

19:09.657 --> 19:10.589
That was amazing, Venus!

19:10.625 --> 19:12.593
Nice receive!

19:12.660 --> 19:14.958
We didn't have
much to do today.

19:15.029 --> 19:15.859
Yeah...

19:18.633 --> 19:19.622
YEAH!

19:22.370 --> 19:25.271
No... We should go to
a concert on Sunday.

19:25.306 --> 19:27.467
But we can't
change plans now!

19:27.976 --> 19:29.034
Aino...

19:29.077 --> 19:30.544
Hey!

19:30.979 --> 19:32.879
You know...

19:33.882 --> 19:38.251
If... If you were able to
meet Sailor Venus somewhere...

19:38.286 --> 19:42.188
...could you tell her
thanks for saving me?

19:43.892 --> 19:45.416
What's that?

19:45.493 --> 19:48.985
Well, if I see her,
I'll make sure to tell her.

19:50.498 --> 19:52.159
Let's go.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.293
Yeah... See ya.

20:00.275 --> 20:01.708
Young lady!

20:07.482 --> 20:10.747
Will you spend an evening
together with me?

20:23.231 --> 20:25.131
Well, I'll consider that offer.

20:25.166 --> 20:26.997
Oh, man...

20:29.997 --> 20:33.997
