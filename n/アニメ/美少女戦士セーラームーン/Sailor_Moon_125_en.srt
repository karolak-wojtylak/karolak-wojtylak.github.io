1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,925
If you have just a little bit of courage...

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,403
...people can really be soldiers.

3
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:08,235
If you have feelings for other people...

4
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:10,764
...anyone can become a messiah.

5
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:12,572
No matter how much you change...

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,773
...please don't forget that there
are people who care for you.

7
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:18,977
I'll make sure to save you!!

8
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:24,665
I'm sorry...

9
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:29,403
Chibiusa... I'm sorry...

10
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:35,738
She finally went away...

11
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:47,318
Hotaru!!

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,727
Give it up already!
She is no longer Hotaru!!

13
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:57,229
That's right...
Hotaru Tomoe died just now.

14
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:00,231
You're lying!!

15
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:09,042
The giant power that's fast
approaching through this Tau Nebula...

16
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:11,448
...is the master of
us Death Busters!

17
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:14,612
The ruler of silence, Pharaoh 90!

18
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:17,555
Now, if I can get a hold of the Grail...

19
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:22,119
...Pharaoh 90 will appear,
and the age of silence will begin!

20
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:28,326
Then, we will defeat you now!

21
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:32,635
Resign yourself!.

22
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,230
WORLD...

23
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:36,242
...SHAKING!

24
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,039
DEEP...

25
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:39,841
...SUBMERGE!

26
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,016
You can't!

27
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:50,750
Why, thank you.

28
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,415
You idiot!

29
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,550
Don't get in our way!

30
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,891
Shoot!

31
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:16,773
If you don't want these two killed right
before your eyes, hand over the Grail.

32
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:18,541
You can't!!

33
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,883
Shall I get rid of one of them first?

34
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,384
Wait!

35
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:31,625
I-If you hand the Grail over to her,
I will detest you!!

36
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:33,125
But...

37
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:34,966
Stop it!

38
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,263
Sailor Moon!

39
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:47,579
Stop it!!

40
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,823
Hotaru...

41
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:02,355
Hotaru's... dad?

42
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,330
Hotaru...

43
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,928
It's me...

44
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:11,834
Your Papa...

45
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:16,069
Hotaru... you ended up
like this because of me...

46
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,138
The empty shell of Germatoid...?

47
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,343
You're just a shell!
Don't touch me! How filthy!

48
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,685
Stop it already!

49
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:38,129
Stop it...

50
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:41,131
Please...

51
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,072
Everyone, hang in there!

52
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:49,303
It's gaining power...

53
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,234
I won't lose!

54
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,739
We won't let this Daimohn
loose into the city!

55
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:01,777
Hotaru...

56
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,251
Papa...

57
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:14,465
Papa...

58
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,362
Impossible!

59
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,105
Hotaru...

60
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:33,846
The body is rejecting me...?

61
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:41,359
This hurts, Papa...

62
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,192
Finish her, Sailor Moon!

63
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:49,428
No!

64
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:51,904
Because...

65
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:54,202
Hotaru is alive...

66
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:57,103
Don't be fooled!!

67
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,106
Hotaru, are you in pain...?

68
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,179
The Grail...

69
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:05,309
The Grail?

70
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:09,151
If I don't have the Grail...
I no longer...

71
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:14,451
Hang in there, Hotaru...

72
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,985
This Grail...

73
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,726
...where is it, Hotaru!?

74
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,229
Papa...?

75
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:37,739
Why, Sailor Moon!?

76
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:51,295
You're not the messiah or anything...

77
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:54,232
You have no right to do with
the Grail as you please!!

78
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,428
Hotaru is still alive...

79
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,198
She's alive!!

80
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:02,868
We can't save the world unless
innocent little Hotaru dies...!?

81
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:05,767
That just can't be true!!

82
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:12,784
Oh... is this...

83
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,286
Is that the Grail?

84
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,157
Please, can I...?

85
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:22,786
For Hotaru...?

86
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,294
Thank you...

87
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:34,564
Now, Hotaru...

88
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:37,542
The Grail... You want this?

89
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:39,545
Yes... Hurry...

90
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:54,916
Dammit!!

91
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,390
Sailor Moon...

92
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:06,329
After I greet Pharaoh 90, I will
give you a special choice...

93
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:09,933
...to continue living as
a body for a Daimohn.

94
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,668
Hotaru!
Hotaru, you can hear me, right!?

95
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,441
Hotaru!!

96
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,140
It's no use...

97
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:20,448
No matter what you do,
it's too late now.

98
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,449
Hotaru or this world...
I won't let either go as you please!!

99
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,693
Why don't you give up?

100
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:33,062
This Grail is an ultra-pure
crystal among all pure hearts.

101
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:40,471
Love, hate, happiness, anger, sadness...
elevated to the highest level.

102
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:45,144
To win against Pharaoh 90
after he takes in the Grail...

103
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:48,477
...you'd need to create a pure
heart crystal that surpasses it!

104
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:54,947
There's no way you can win!!

105
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:10,495
What!?

106
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:12,500
What's going on inside!?

107
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,773
Sailor Moon!

108
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,012
The Grail...!?

109
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:34,518
Yes, this way, Pharaoh 90!!

110
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,545
Look! This is the result of
your methods full of idealism!!

111
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,514
MOON COSMIC POWER!!

112
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,969
You, who cannot even undergo
the second transformation...

113
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:20,802
...cannot stop the silence!

114
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,674
The world for the master
and myself will now begin!

115
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,678
Impossible!!

116
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:57,560
Hotaru...

117
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:00,070
Papa...?

118
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:03,207
Hotaru?

119
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,574
Papa...

120
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:07,169
Hotaru...

121
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:09,681
Papa... where are you?

122
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:12,275
Where are you?
It's dark here...

123
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:13,785
I'm right here.

124
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:16,185
I have to save Chibiusa...

125
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:18,986
Papa, let me out of here...

126
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:22,654
I'm sorry...
I don't know what to do...

127
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:26,030
Forgive me...

128
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:29,091
If only I could go back...
to those days once more...

129
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:35,868
Papa!

130
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,110
Hotaru!

131
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:41,109
Papa!

132
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:44,109
Sheesh, papa!

133
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:47,110
Papa...

134
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:51,385
Papa...

135
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:56,625
I'm sorry...

136
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:07,132
Papa.

137
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:16,638
H-Hotaru...

138
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:25,451
Don't come here...

139
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:27,083
You little pest...

140
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:28,184
Hurry up and...

141
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:30,491
...begone!

142
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,121
Even if you live...

143
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:34,428
...your life is useless...

144
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,560
Do not get...

145
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:38,160
...in our way!

146
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:43,140
Begone! Be destroyed!

147
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:44,702
No!

148
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:46,974
I will definitely NOT!

149
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:50,607
Dammit...

150
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,016
I... I...

151
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,085
I have people dear to me!!

152
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:15,199
H-Hotaru...

153
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,200
The revival of the Warrior of Ruin...!?

154
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:31,885
You are...?

155
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:38,328
Chibiusa... You're all right now...

156
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,147
Sailor Saturn...!

157
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,013
Hotaru...?

158
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:03,120
Thank you, Chibiusa...

159
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:05,715
Thank you.

160
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,723
Pharaoh 90 is gaining power!

161
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:16,097
Now, we have no means
to stop the silence...

162
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,598
Hotaru!

163
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:47,390
In the end...
Everything we did goes to waste...?

164
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:49,891
This is the end.

165
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:54,834
Are you satisfied with
this, Sailor Moon!?

166
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:59,109
Answer me!!

167
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:04,372
Sailor Moon.

168
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:17,191
Thank you for protecting my body...

169
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:19,322
It's all thanks to you.

170
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:20,923
Sailor Saturn...

171
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,925
Hotaru?

172
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:26,436
Hotaru!!

173
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:30,571
I am no longer Hotaru.

174
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:34,602
The only one who can save
the world from silence now is me.

175
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:35,944
Leave everything else to me.

176
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:37,642
Wait! I'll go with you!

177
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:38,877
No...

178
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:46,086
To defeat Pharaoh 90, you need to enter
its core and make it all disappear at once...

179
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,925
I don't know about Super Sailor Moon,
but as you stand now...

180
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:54,922
...you can't even enter Pharaoh 90
now that it has the power of the Grail.

181
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,958
This is my job now.

182
00:15:57,937 --> 00:16:01,464
When you defeat Pharaoh 90...
what will happen to you?

183
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:04,765
The reason I am called
the Warrior of Ruin...

184
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,837
...is because I am given enough
power to destroy a planet.

185
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:09,973
However...

186
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:13,416
...when I use that power,
I myself will also...

187
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:16,449
You can't!

188
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:24,326
Farewell...

189
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,374
Hotaru!

190
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:53,851
CRISIS MAKE UP!

191
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:01,458
CRISIS MAKE UP!

192
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:07,901
CRISIS MAKE UP!

193
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,001
CRISIS MAKE UP!

194
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,910
Please, transform!!

195
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:27,918
CRISIS MAKE UP...

196
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:31,921
Sailor Moon...

197
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,925
Sailor Moon...

198
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,927
Sailor Moon...

199
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:40,938
Sailor Moon...

200
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,949
CRISIS...

201
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:59,715
MAKE UP!

202
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,478
Farewell...

203
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:26,943
If you are able to
meet the real Messiah...

204
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:30,414
The real... Messiah...!?

205
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:37,414
