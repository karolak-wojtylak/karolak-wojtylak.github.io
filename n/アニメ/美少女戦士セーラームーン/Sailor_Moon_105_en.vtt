00:02.500 --> 00:04.695
Mako-chan is training in
a temple up in the mountains.

00:04.736 --> 00:05.532
What's wrong?

00:05.570 --> 00:07.060
Are you worried about something?

00:07.105 --> 00:11.007
Mako-chan, your worries
make all of us worry, too!

00:14.779 --> 00:19.716
Don't forget, all of us
are right behind you!

00:42.600 --> 00:45.831
Why... Why did I lose
to someone like that..!?

00:45.870 --> 00:48.270
IRONDER!

00:53.043 --> 00:54.840
It's my turn if you want power!

00:59.717 --> 01:00.877
Dammit!

01:00.918 --> 01:03.443
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

01:06.123 --> 01:09.251
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

01:10.127 --> 01:12.459
LOVELY!

01:20.371 --> 01:24.205
I need to find a way to
power myself up even more!

01:37.888 --> 01:39.719
I would like to speak with Eugeal.

01:40.124 --> 01:44.618
Eugeal here. I have already
selected the next target.

01:44.662 --> 01:46.823
Nothing less from you, Eugeal.

01:46.864 --> 01:49.230
And, the next target is?

01:50.034 --> 01:53.470
A Nichiren school monk by
the name of Kakusui Yakushiji.

01:53.504 --> 01:55.699
He's been training in the
mountains, for 4 years...

01:55.739 --> 01:58.003
...and 4 months now, to find
the true meaning of life.

01:58.375 --> 02:02.004
He is the owner of a heart with a
purity rarely seen in people as of late.

02:02.713 --> 02:06.911
By the way, Professor...
What shapes do the talismans come in?

02:06.951 --> 02:10.648
If the pure hearts
are the real talismans...

02:10.688 --> 02:13.213
They should transform into the shape
of the three divine objects...

02:13.257 --> 02:19.162
In other words, a mirror,
a sword, and an orb.

02:19.196 --> 02:21.721
And when the three divine
objects gather in one place...

02:21.765 --> 02:25.565
...the holy grail is sure to appear.

02:41.051 --> 02:43.042
DARUMAH!

03:05.910 --> 03:06.672
Oh?

03:06.710 --> 03:08.905
This postcard is from Mako-chan...

03:10.414 --> 03:12.939
Mako-chan is currently
training at a temple...

03:12.983 --> 03:13.915
Training?

03:14.952 --> 03:16.078
OH!

03:16.120 --> 03:20.420
The temple that Mako-chan is in is right
near the hotel where Mamo-chan is at!

03:21.158 --> 03:24.423
Mamo-chan is working part-time
at a resort hotel right now.

03:26.130 --> 03:27.427
This makes me a lucky girl!

03:27.464 --> 03:29.125
Y-You can't be...

03:40.377 --> 03:41.469
I'm so thrilled!

03:41.512 --> 03:44.743
This is why I can't stop traveling!

03:45.749 --> 03:48.775
Come on now... You should calm
down a little more when you eat.

03:48.819 --> 03:50.684
You have pieces of your
lunch stuck on your cheek!

03:52.690 --> 03:54.681
Usagi, I'm hungry.

03:54.725 --> 03:56.693
Mina, can you give us some, too?

03:57.161 --> 03:58.185
Oh, sure.

04:05.736 --> 04:07.169
Hey, Usagi.

04:07.204 --> 04:09.798
I'm surprised that
Chibiusa didn't tag along.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.365
I showed her that I was worthy
of being her future mom...

04:12.409 --> 04:15.003
...and she was satisfied
with my explanation.

04:15.045 --> 04:16.842
She told me she was
going to the bathroom!

04:16.880 --> 04:20.008
Then she went out the back door,
leaving me here!!

04:20.317 --> 04:21.784
OOH! I'm not going to forgive her!

04:23.821 --> 04:26.289
W-Why does it end up this way...?

04:34.398 --> 04:39.028
According to the guidebook, there is
supposed to be a great hotel around here.

04:39.937 --> 04:42.030
Oh! There it is!

04:42.673 --> 04:44.106
It's wonderful!

04:44.141 --> 04:47.042
Hey, why don't we sleep
over in that hotel?

04:47.344 --> 04:51.337
But we're here to help
Mako-chan with her training.

04:51.382 --> 04:53.942
It doesn't matter where we sleep.

04:53.984 --> 04:57.920
I mean, we're fine as long
as we can help Mako-chan out...

04:57.955 --> 05:00.082
Oh, you're saying pretty
decent things today, Usagi.

05:00.124 --> 05:03.457
I don't care where we go,
as long as we can study.

05:03.494 --> 05:05.257
Then, let's change our plans!

05:05.295 --> 05:07.058
STOP!

05:07.264 --> 05:10.700
Everyone, don't fall for
Usagi's little conspiracy!

05:10.734 --> 05:12.599
What is Usagi's conspiracy?

05:12.636 --> 05:14.194
I-It's nothing...

05:14.505 --> 05:18.032
Mamoru is working in that hotel!

05:18.075 --> 05:21.772
Then, how you said you wanted
to help Mako-chan's training...

05:21.812 --> 05:23.939
...and how you wanted to study...

05:23.981 --> 05:25.380
...were all lies!

05:25.416 --> 05:27.043
I-I wasn't lying!

05:27.084 --> 05:29.245
Come on, it's a TRIP after all...

05:29.286 --> 05:32.187
...wouldn't it be more fun if
there were many objectives?

05:32.222 --> 05:33.348
Right? Right??

05:33.390 --> 05:37.554
Let's go to the temple,
like we originally planned!

05:47.705 --> 05:49.468
How many steps are there?

05:49.506 --> 05:52.737
Compared to the Hikawa Shrine
it's about 52 times as long.

05:52.776 --> 05:54.607
This is killing me...

06:05.522 --> 06:06.318
Mako-chan!

06:08.692 --> 06:10.421
What are all of you doing here?

06:10.461 --> 06:14.625
We're here to help
your training, of course!

06:14.965 --> 06:17.559
That wasn't nice of you to
come here without telling us!

06:17.601 --> 06:20.627
We'll help you in any way we can!

06:28.946 --> 06:30.504
Isn't he amazing?

06:30.814 --> 06:34.580
He does 50 laps around
these mountains every day!

06:35.686 --> 06:38.951
You fell in love with that
monk, didn't you, Mako-chan...

06:40.924 --> 06:45.452
T-That's not it!
Now, back to training!

06:58.008 --> 07:00.841
Even though it's summer,
the river water is cold!

07:02.246 --> 07:05.443
Please, let me join you.

07:10.521 --> 07:12.079
I-I can't...

07:12.122 --> 07:15.853
How can I be like you, Mr. Kakusui?

07:16.093 --> 07:19.119
I'm in a slump right now...

07:19.163 --> 07:24.362
I can't give you the details, but my
attacks are no good against the enemy.

07:28.472 --> 07:31.168
If I could achieve a
mental state like yours...

07:31.208 --> 07:33.870
...Mr. Kakusui, I think I
could get out of this slump!

07:37.881 --> 07:39.872
Why won't you speak to me!?

07:40.918 --> 07:43.887
I-It's so cold...
that my mouth doesn't move...

07:48.892 --> 07:50.382
I might have caught a cold...

07:52.062 --> 07:54.394
That smile suits you well.

07:56.033 --> 07:58.399
"There is no path that lets me live
my life other than this path."

07:58.435 --> 08:00.130
"Therefore, I walk this path."

08:00.170 --> 08:02.263
That is my favorite quote...

08:02.306 --> 08:04.900
"There is no path that lets me live
my life other than this path."

08:04.942 --> 08:06.739
"Therefore, I walk this path..."

08:06.777 --> 08:12.113
However, despite this being the path I
chose, whenever my training doesn't...

08:12.149 --> 08:15.983
...go quite as well as I want, I keep
wondering if this was the right path...

08:16.019 --> 08:17.919
Even you wonder about
that, Mr. Kakusui?

08:20.123 --> 08:24.583
I won't lose against anyone in
terms of wondering about my life.

08:27.197 --> 08:30.030
Found the target!

08:34.538 --> 08:36.130
Hey, Mako-chan.

08:36.173 --> 08:39.404
Why did you come up with this
idea of training so suddenly?

08:39.443 --> 08:41.707
I-I really don't have
a particular reason.

08:41.745 --> 08:43.576
Is that really so?

08:43.614 --> 08:46.481
If you're worried about
something, tell us.

08:46.783 --> 08:49.479
It's better if you don't keep
your worries piled up inside you.

08:49.519 --> 08:53.512
Though, there IS a problem if you don't
have anything inside you, like Usagi...

08:53.557 --> 08:55.957
What do you mean by that, Rei!?

08:57.628 --> 09:00.324
How dare you!?
Take that! And that!

09:02.499 --> 09:06.731
I have nothing to do with it!!

09:31.161 --> 09:35.393
You guys came all the
way out here just for me...

09:35.432 --> 09:40.529
But this problem is something
I want to solve on my own...

10:06.830 --> 10:08.058
It's noisy...

10:08.098 --> 10:09.622
What is it...?

10:18.909 --> 10:19.933
Mako-chan...

10:19.977 --> 10:23.913
It looks like we'll be better off
not helping her after all...

10:23.947 --> 10:26.677
Seems that way!

10:28.452 --> 10:30.113
W-What is this!?

10:33.357 --> 10:36.622
Oh, no... I can't get
any energy from this!

10:36.860 --> 10:40.591
But this gets your
brain working better.

10:40.630 --> 10:43.724
And eating this food definitely
will make you lose weight!

10:43.767 --> 10:46.235
Usagi, this is the perfect
opportunity for you!

10:46.269 --> 10:47.361
I don't care if I get fat.

10:47.404 --> 10:52.137
At least when I'm traveling,
I want to eat something yummy...

10:52.376 --> 10:54.844
It looks like Mako-chan already left.

10:54.878 --> 10:56.641
Makoto sure is working hard...

11:00.150 --> 11:03.813
All right! Let's go to that
hotel for breakfast today!

11:04.855 --> 11:07.653
Don't you think about
anything other than food!?

11:08.458 --> 11:11.154
Y-You don't have to be
so harsh when you ask...

11:11.461 --> 11:14.157
All right, fine,
we'll go to the hotel.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.358
What are we going
to do with this meal?

11:18.402 --> 11:20.836
I feel bad, since they
prepared it for us.

11:20.871 --> 11:23.396
Of course, I'm going to eat it!

11:23.607 --> 11:26.838
Speaking of the hotel... Tadah!

11:27.110 --> 11:29.135
My, you are prepared...

11:29.179 --> 11:30.339
Actually, me too...

11:31.615 --> 11:34.607
I brought one too! See, see?

11:34.918 --> 11:38.752
I guess Ami was the only one who
was seriously thinking about Mako-chan.

11:38.789 --> 11:40.347
Ami is in a class by
herself, after all!

11:43.660 --> 11:45.355
A-Actually, I...

11:57.007 --> 12:01.000
Oh, man! A meal just
has to be like THIS!

12:06.049 --> 12:07.448
M-Mamo-chan!

12:07.484 --> 12:09.418
Oh... Usako?

12:09.453 --> 12:10.647
Is everyone here?

12:10.687 --> 12:13.952
What a coincidence,
to meet here of all places!

12:13.990 --> 12:16.652
Gee, you really can't lie well...

12:16.693 --> 12:19.321
Mamo-chan, let's go out
somewhere and play!

12:19.963 --> 12:22.557
Sorry, but I don't have time for that.

12:22.599 --> 12:26.057
This place pays really well,
but the workload is pretty tough...

12:26.103 --> 12:28.469
Hey, Chiba! Come over here for a sec!

12:28.505 --> 12:29.335
Sure!

12:31.141 --> 12:32.335
How boring.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.002
Cute...

12:34.044 --> 12:35.568
All four of them aren't bad.

12:35.612 --> 12:37.477
That girl is rather cute.

12:37.514 --> 12:39.141
Hey, why don't you go talk to them?

12:39.182 --> 12:42.151
That girl's eyes really
catch my attention!

12:42.185 --> 12:43.345
So wonderful...

12:43.386 --> 12:45.911
Hurry up and go over there!
Come on!

12:45.956 --> 12:48.356
Hey, those girls over
there are even better!

12:48.391 --> 12:49.085
Oh, you're right!

12:49.126 --> 12:50.855
Let's go over there!

12:56.199 --> 12:57.860
W-What was that...?

13:07.010 --> 13:10.446
Huh? It's Haruka and Michiru!

13:13.383 --> 13:15.146
Oh, so you're here too, buns-head?

13:15.185 --> 13:15.981
Yeah!

13:16.019 --> 13:17.111
Hello!

13:17.154 --> 13:18.314
What a coincidence...

13:18.355 --> 13:20.846
Michiru, your swimsuit is gorgeous!

13:20.891 --> 13:22.017
Thank you.

13:22.058 --> 13:24.652
But your swimsuits are all lovely, too.

13:24.694 --> 13:28.130
I-Is it really that great...?

13:28.465 --> 13:30.626
Usagi, why don't we start heading back?

13:30.667 --> 13:33.295
B-But, I want to stay
here a little longer...

13:33.336 --> 13:35.463
Usagi, no matter how
long you hold out here...

13:35.505 --> 13:37.632
...you won't be able to
go on a date with Mamoru!

13:37.674 --> 13:39.835
Hah! Bull's-eye!

13:39.876 --> 13:42.106
Sheesh, Rei, you're so mean to me!

13:42.145 --> 13:43.976
Take that!

13:51.755 --> 13:55.088
The wind is bringing me
the scent of the humid sea.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.889
Something IS going to happen.

14:05.202 --> 14:09.002
Just like Rei said,
I couldn't go on a date!

14:32.996 --> 14:34.190
H-He's asleep...

14:41.071 --> 14:42.538
Sorry about that...

14:42.572 --> 14:45.132
You're in the middle
of your training...

14:45.175 --> 14:49.771
Sometimes it is important to relax
and get rid of the excess power.

14:49.813 --> 14:51.872
Was that a poor excuse?

14:57.787 --> 14:58.776
Get out of the way!

14:58.822 --> 14:59.880
Captured!

15:09.766 --> 15:10.733
Mr. Kakusui!

15:10.767 --> 15:14.066
People... cannot live alone...

15:14.104 --> 15:16.265
Don't force yourself...

15:17.374 --> 15:18.534
Mr. Kakusui!!

15:24.347 --> 15:27.077
JUPITER STAR POWER...

15:27.117 --> 15:29.642
...MAKE UP!

15:47.404 --> 15:50.464
MOON COSMIC POWER...

15:50.507 --> 15:53.032
...MAKE UP!

16:25.442 --> 16:26.932
Oh?

16:27.977 --> 16:32.437
I, Sailor Jupiter, will not forgive
anyone putting their hands on Mr. Kakusui!

16:34.217 --> 16:36.947
A Daimohn is enough
to fight against you.

16:37.721 --> 16:41.020
Appear before me, Daimohn!

16:45.829 --> 16:47.126
Darumah!

17:03.113 --> 17:05.172
Hold it right there!

17:06.316 --> 17:09.774
Even if your evil plans make
heroes of justice stumble 7 times...

17:09.819 --> 17:13.186
...they will always
stand up an 8th time!

17:13.223 --> 17:14.713
For love and justice...

17:14.758 --> 17:17.192
A pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

17:21.664 --> 17:23.188
Sailor Moon!

17:24.768 --> 17:28.465
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

17:28.505 --> 17:30.871
And we'll chastise you, too!

17:32.876 --> 17:35.367
Leave this to me!

17:35.412 --> 17:37.880
This time, I'll make sure
I defeat this thing by myself!

17:38.381 --> 17:41.578
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

17:56.699 --> 17:59.998
Thanks for the hard work,
but this isn't a talisman.

18:04.841 --> 18:07.401
She sure runs away quickly...

18:10.246 --> 18:11.338
Shall we help?

18:11.381 --> 18:12.780
I'll do it myself...

18:12.816 --> 18:13.908
I'll defeat it by myself!

18:13.950 --> 18:16.248
Don't force yourself to do so.

18:31.434 --> 18:35.165
Jupiter, don't force yourself to do
this! We can combine our powers!

18:35.205 --> 18:37.230
The five of us come together as one!

18:37.273 --> 18:38.604
Believe in everyone!

18:38.641 --> 18:39.938
We all fight together!

18:41.678 --> 18:44.476
People... cannot live alone...

18:44.514 --> 18:45.606
Don't force yourself...

18:46.783 --> 18:49.445
I'll believe in everyone...
And I'll fight with everyone!

18:49.719 --> 18:51.846
Now!

19:14.043 --> 19:17.774
Sometimes it is important to relax
and get rid of the excess power.

19:30.527 --> 19:34.293
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

20:11.067 --> 20:13.831
It looks like Mako-chan resolved
whatever it was that was worrying her.

20:16.831 --> 20:20.831
