00:02.000 --> 00:04.468
Hotaru is missing...

00:04.503 --> 00:06.937
Nobody is at her house, either...

00:06.972 --> 00:10.373
Haruka's group said that she
was the warrior of destruction...

00:10.409 --> 00:13.867
...but I won't let them kill her!

00:14.580 --> 00:19.643
I, Sailor Moon, WILL save her!

00:33.840 --> 00:36.968
You don't know the horror of silence!

00:38.544 --> 00:41.604
Unless we kill that girl,
Sailor Saturn will awaken.

00:43.650 --> 00:47.347
If Saturn awakens,
it means the end of this planet.

01:03.002 --> 01:04.060
Chibiusa...

01:17.116 --> 01:18.583
Small Lady...

01:19.352 --> 01:21.217
Plu...

01:21.254 --> 01:24.087
Where... Where did you take Hotaru!?

01:26.626 --> 01:29.823
When I got here,
everyone had already disappeared...

01:29.862 --> 01:32.353
That's a lie!
Hotaru is my friend!

01:32.398 --> 01:35.128
She wouldn't disappear
without telling me!

01:35.168 --> 01:36.032
Plu...

01:36.069 --> 01:37.195
It's your fault, Plu!

01:37.236 --> 01:40.296
She disappeared because
you guys said mean things, Plu!

01:40.340 --> 01:41.568
Hotaru...

01:41.607 --> 01:43.131
Hotaru is my...

01:43.176 --> 01:45.144
F-Friend...!!

01:46.646 --> 01:48.170
Small Lady...

01:48.214 --> 01:50.512
Plu...

01:51.050 --> 01:52.745
I hate you, Plu...!

01:53.720 --> 01:56.154
Small Lady...

01:58.324 --> 02:00.758
Nobody was in Hotaru's house.

02:01.327 --> 02:05.093
Neither Professor Tomoe,
her father... or his assistant, Kaori...

02:05.131 --> 02:07.759
And they didn't leave even one clue...

02:08.468 --> 02:11.164
What can you find out using
the computer, Mamo-chan?

02:11.204 --> 02:15.265
Information about Professor Tomoe should
be registered in the academic files...

02:15.308 --> 02:17.435
Perhaps there's a clue there...

02:17.477 --> 02:18.409
Here it is!

02:18.444 --> 02:22.540
Soichi Tomoe, the pioneer
man in genetic engineering...

02:22.582 --> 02:24.277
Professor at Mugen Academy...?

02:24.584 --> 02:25.915
Mugen Academy...?

02:25.952 --> 02:27.920
That's where Haruka and
company attend, right?

02:27.954 --> 02:29.114
Hotaru, too.

02:29.622 --> 02:33.752
That's the elite school with strict
standards, full of geniuses, right?

02:33.793 --> 02:34.760
Yes.

02:34.794 --> 02:37.490
An education from elementary school
all the way up to its university.

02:37.530 --> 02:39.555
I hear that the high-rise
building which serves as...

02:39.599 --> 02:41.624
...their campus is filled
with state-of-the-art equipment.

02:44.070 --> 02:45.662
What's wrong?

02:45.705 --> 02:48.401
Not only is Soichi Tomoe
a professor at Mugen Academy...

02:48.441 --> 02:50.306
...but he's also the owner.

02:52.078 --> 02:54.638
Owner... you mean it's his school?

02:54.680 --> 02:56.045
What does that mean?

02:56.082 --> 02:59.381
Perhaps there is a clue at that school...

02:59.419 --> 03:01.819
It looks like we need to investigate...

03:02.221 --> 03:03.347
Setsuna!

03:03.389 --> 03:04.754
Chibiusa!

03:04.791 --> 03:06.019
What's wrong?

03:06.058 --> 03:08.322
You shouldn't walk around so late at night...

03:08.361 --> 03:09.555
Wait...

03:09.595 --> 03:12.029
Chibiusa, you're soaked!

03:12.064 --> 03:13.588
What are you doing?

03:13.633 --> 03:15.658
You didn't take an umbrella with you?

03:15.701 --> 03:19.660
Sheesh, you're so soaked...
You'll catch a cold.

03:19.705 --> 03:21.172
Now, come over here...

03:21.574 --> 03:22.871
Usako.

03:22.909 --> 03:24.604
Mamo-chan...

03:26.179 --> 03:28.113
Thanks for walking her back here.

03:28.147 --> 03:29.876
Then, I will be on my way.

03:29.916 --> 03:31.178
No, wait.

03:31.818 --> 03:34.582
We would like to ask a little
about Mugen Academy.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.178
Do you mind?

03:40.793 --> 03:45.696
Mugen Academy is a school that
Soichi Tomoe created three years ago.

03:45.731 --> 03:49.724
However, many strange incidents
have happened on campus.

03:49.769 --> 03:53.603
So Uranus and Neptune, who'd been thinking
the school was suspicious for a while...

03:53.639 --> 03:55.368
...entered Mugen Academy
as students to investigate.

03:55.408 --> 03:56.773
Undercover operation...

03:56.809 --> 03:58.208
Then, Professor Tomoe is...

04:00.146 --> 04:03.206
We feel that he has something
to do with the Death Busters...

04:03.649 --> 04:06.482
But then, Hotaru...

04:06.519 --> 04:08.680
...is part of the Death Busters, too?

04:08.721 --> 04:10.450
We don't know...

04:10.490 --> 04:15.723
All we know is that Hotaru Tomoe is
the reincarnation of Sailor Saturn.

04:16.696 --> 04:18.220
That's right...

04:18.764 --> 04:21.528
There's no way that
Hotaru can be our enemy!

04:21.567 --> 04:22.795
Chibiusa...

04:22.835 --> 04:25.736
Hotaru is a really good, kind girl!

04:26.005 --> 04:26.835
You can't...

04:26.873 --> 04:28.773
You can't kill her!

04:28.808 --> 04:31.902
You just can't do something like that!

04:31.944 --> 04:33.241
Setsuna...

04:34.013 --> 04:36.504
Even if Saturn was
the soldier of destruction...

04:36.549 --> 04:38.244
...she's still a Sailor
Soldier like us, right?

04:39.151 --> 04:43.053
Isn't there another way around this?

04:46.859 --> 04:52.263
This is why we didn't want to
involve all of you in this battle...

05:02.174 --> 05:03.573
It's me...

05:03.609 --> 05:05.770
Professor, it's Mimet.

05:06.345 --> 05:08.279
I found the next target!

05:08.848 --> 05:12.284
The authority on the physics of
alternate dimensions, Dr. Sergai Ajimov!

05:13.052 --> 05:16.283
He's holding a special lecture
at Mugen Academy today.

05:16.889 --> 05:20.416
The theory of an alternate universe...
A very curious hypothesis.

05:20.459 --> 05:21.448
Then...!

05:21.494 --> 05:25.294
No, unfortunately, there is no
need for you to head out for now.

05:25.665 --> 05:28.793
But he's very cool and handsome...

05:29.168 --> 05:32.797
Well, I'll be contacting you soon, Mimet.

05:33.739 --> 05:37.436
I understand... I will be waiting.

05:48.621 --> 05:50.816
It's time to go, Telulu.

05:51.490 --> 05:52.923
Oh, my!

05:52.959 --> 05:56.019
She is doing her best...

05:56.062 --> 05:58.326
But, I'm not getting
the results I really want...

05:59.565 --> 06:03.092
So I decided that I should
put my hopes upon you.

06:03.135 --> 06:07.834
If you succeed, you will become
the next executive! Do your best!

06:07.873 --> 06:09.340
Yes, Professor!

06:09.642 --> 06:11.633
Then, I'll be going now...

06:14.347 --> 06:15.939
You've got to be kidding!

06:15.982 --> 06:17.847
This has to be a joke!

06:23.856 --> 06:25.517
Yes, Telulu here.

06:25.558 --> 06:27.822
I'm sorry to bother you again, Telulu...

06:27.860 --> 06:31.193
But that operation has been canceled.

06:31.230 --> 06:32.857
I will call you again.

06:32.898 --> 06:36.356
Just you sit there and wait!

06:37.737 --> 06:39.864
"Just you"...?

06:41.474 --> 06:45.274
I am the next executive
of the Death Busters!!

06:45.311 --> 06:46.141
Fine!

06:46.178 --> 06:50.877
I'll just have to get rid of the Sailor Soldiers
myself and show them what power I have!

06:53.085 --> 06:54.382
Oh, Chief Eugeal!

06:55.054 --> 06:58.956
I'll borrow that machine you
were making for a little bit!

07:12.905 --> 07:14.099
This is creepy...

07:14.140 --> 07:16.506
I do feel something ominous here.

07:16.542 --> 07:17.702
Mugen Academy...

07:17.743 --> 07:19.108
It really is suspicious.

07:19.145 --> 07:23.138
It seems like this school is holding a
special lecture with a guest speaker today.

07:23.182 --> 07:25.650
It says that anyone can
enter the school today.

07:25.685 --> 07:27.346
It's our chance! Let's go!

07:27.386 --> 07:28.353
Yeah!

07:34.994 --> 07:36.962
An article from 4 years ago...?

07:36.996 --> 07:39.829
A huge fire at a genetic engineering lab...

07:39.865 --> 07:42.663
All the research staffers died...

07:42.702 --> 07:46.103
Professor Tomoe and his eldest
daughter's miraculous survival...

07:46.505 --> 07:50.566
They were able to escape from a building
lost in a huge fire without a scratch...?

07:50.609 --> 07:51.940
Just the two of them?

07:51.977 --> 07:53.968
What does this mean?

08:01.854 --> 08:03.685
Hotaru is a kind girl!

08:03.723 --> 08:05.486
You can't just kill her like that!

08:12.798 --> 08:14.288
Nobody's here.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.824
Everyone must be at the lecture hall.

08:16.869 --> 08:17.665
What should we do?

08:17.703 --> 08:20.331
For now, let's look for the computer room.

08:20.372 --> 08:22.499
We might be able to find
something out if we look there.

08:24.343 --> 08:27.437
What is it, Mako-chan?

08:29.749 --> 08:32.684
I said, what is it?

08:33.686 --> 08:36.746
- Hey, Mako-chan, stop it.
- No, it's not me, it isn't!

08:36.789 --> 08:38.381
I said, stop it!

08:38.424 --> 08:40.016
Hey! Can't you stay quiet... huh?

08:44.330 --> 08:46.525
What are you doing here?!

08:46.932 --> 08:51.528
Um, we were wondering where the lecture
hall was... We're kinda lost... yeah...

08:52.071 --> 08:55.438
The lecture hall is that way.
Turn right when you get to the wall.

08:55.474 --> 08:58.034
- Oh, yeah, I see.
- Thanks a lot.

08:58.444 --> 08:59.536
Wait.

09:00.246 --> 09:03.272
You forgot something.

09:03.649 --> 09:07.380
I-I'm a little weak in the knees...

09:08.254 --> 09:10.950
What are you doing?
You're so embarrassing!

09:10.990 --> 09:13.720
I'm so sorry...

09:17.596 --> 09:18.995
H-Hey, you, hold it right there!

09:20.332 --> 09:23.233
I'm not suspicious or anything!

09:23.602 --> 09:25.229
You're TOO suspicious!

09:25.671 --> 09:28.299
Let me take a look
at what you got there!

09:28.340 --> 09:30.240
W-Wait a minute!

09:30.276 --> 09:31.709
No!

09:31.744 --> 09:32.301
Show it!

09:32.344 --> 09:35.142
No, no, stop it!

09:38.450 --> 09:40.213
I don't have anything to lose anymore...

09:40.252 --> 09:42.243
Will you stay out of my way?

10:09.181 --> 10:13.242
An alternate universe.
It's not a faraway existence.

10:14.153 --> 10:16.644
The possibility that an alternate
dimension and our own universe...

10:16.689 --> 10:21.251
...are ALWAYS working in parallel
to one another is very large!

10:21.527 --> 10:24.758
For instance, take a small nebula like this.

10:24.797 --> 10:27.197
Perhaps it's that nebulas such as this...

10:27.233 --> 10:31.761
...are just invisible to us,
and may as well exist right next to us.

10:32.037 --> 10:36.565
And there is the further possibility
that there are life-forms inside.

10:36.609 --> 10:38.770
We are unable to see them.

10:39.144 --> 10:44.446
But, at the same time, I believe that
the rare unable to see us, either.

10:44.483 --> 10:52.948
Likewise, there's a possibility that outside our
universe, there lies an even bigger universe.

10:53.292 --> 10:55.123
We are unable to see it for now.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.024
But...

10:56.061 --> 11:02.660
...if the conditions are right, we will be able
to find such a universe... and observe it.

11:09.875 --> 11:13.936
I'm glad that the school
staff are all so academic.

11:13.979 --> 11:18.177
We can even come inside
off-limits places like this as a result.

11:19.952 --> 11:23.547
But the entrance to the central
headquarters of the Death Busters...

11:24.256 --> 11:28.056
...is not that easy to find, huh...?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.433
Don't surprise us...

11:36.468 --> 11:39.835
The girls are also investigating
this Mugen Academy.

11:41.106 --> 11:41.834
I see...

11:42.308 --> 11:44.367
This is only my hypothesis, but...

11:44.410 --> 11:50.349
...perhaps it's true that the alternate
universe in itself maybe one giant life-form.

11:59.358 --> 12:06.491
The time for our beautiful space to swallow the
Milky Way galaxy in its entirety is approaching.

12:15.641 --> 12:16.266
Papa!

12:20.012 --> 12:23.778
Now, Hotaru, it's dangerous if
you poke your head out like that.

12:24.483 --> 12:25.711
Look.

12:25.751 --> 12:30.779
This is a special space that I prepared
for delicate gene splicing experiments.

12:38.330 --> 12:40.798
Papa... What's that?

12:51.944 --> 12:54.378
Hotaru! Hang in there, Hotaru!

12:54.413 --> 12:55.573
Hotaru...

12:55.614 --> 12:57.309
Oh, what a horrible thing!

12:57.349 --> 12:58.782
Hotaru...

13:02.688 --> 13:06.784
Do you want to save
The life of that girl?

13:07.760 --> 13:09.284
What...!?

13:10.496 --> 13:15.934
I will save the lives of you and that girl.
But I have one condition.

13:18.637 --> 13:20.434
P-Please, save us!

13:20.472 --> 13:22.872
I don't care what happens
to me, but Hotaru...!!

13:22.908 --> 13:27.345
I see...
Then, I'll take over your bodies.

13:41.693 --> 13:44.662
Now, awaken.

13:44.696 --> 13:47.722
For our true purpose!!

13:54.173 --> 13:55.470
Now...

13:55.507 --> 13:59.568
Next, I'll start explaining the equations for the
structure of the alternate dimensional universe.

14:02.981 --> 14:08.578
Everyone, although we are in the middle of
the lecture, Dr. Ajimov will be leaving now.

14:08.620 --> 14:10.417
Please pardon the inconvenience!

14:15.194 --> 14:18.459
It's so nice to be the center of attention...

14:18.497 --> 14:21.694
I won't let Telulu take this joy away from me!

14:26.505 --> 14:28.598
CHARM...

14:28.640 --> 14:31.131
...BUSTER!

14:37.349 --> 14:39.715
Appear, Daimohn!

14:40.018 --> 14:42.714
Upasocon!

14:43.989 --> 14:46.719
Oh, an appearance that truly experiments
with the alternate dimension theory!

14:53.532 --> 14:56.262
Now, do it all in one shot, Upasocon!

14:56.301 --> 14:57.097
Roger!

15:00.873 --> 15:03.307
Preparations complete!

15:03.342 --> 15:04.240
Suction!

15:14.853 --> 15:16.514
Mimet!

15:16.555 --> 15:20.582
Trying to steal the heart of a professor,
the treasure of humankind!

15:20.626 --> 15:22.389
We won't forgive people like that!

15:22.427 --> 15:24.361
Heaven knows, the earth knows,
and people know.

15:24.396 --> 15:26.387
For love and justice,
the Sailor Team!

15:26.431 --> 15:28.160
In the name of the moon,
we'll punish you!

15:31.003 --> 15:33.301
All you do is talk nonsense!

15:33.338 --> 15:35.033
Upasocon, get them!

15:35.073 --> 15:35.664
Roger!

15:36.875 --> 15:38.672
Prepare for attack.

15:39.278 --> 15:40.108
Mount!

15:41.446 --> 15:42.936
Confirm targets.

15:42.981 --> 15:44.915
First attack!

15:49.354 --> 15:51.584
BURNING...

15:51.623 --> 15:53.090
...MANDALA!!

15:53.959 --> 15:55.950
SPARKLING WIDE...

15:57.863 --> 15:59.490
...PRESSURE!

15:59.531 --> 16:00.793
You did it!

16:00.832 --> 16:01.560
Not yet!

16:01.600 --> 16:04.933
They're still hiding
somewhere around there!

16:07.940 --> 16:09.805
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

16:13.745 --> 16:15.542
Being off guard is bad for you!

16:15.581 --> 16:16.980
Jupiter! Mars!

16:17.015 --> 16:19.381
I'm over here, too, you know!

16:19.418 --> 16:21.682
CHARM...

16:21.720 --> 16:24.154
...BUSTER!

16:28.594 --> 16:29.891
Mercury! Venus!

16:30.429 --> 16:31.657
Counterattack!

16:33.365 --> 16:35.595
Jupiter! Mars!

16:37.669 --> 16:40.001
Well done, Upasocon.

16:40.038 --> 16:41.801
An honor greater than imagined!

16:41.840 --> 16:46.436
If I bring back a pure heart,
and also defeat these little brats...

16:46.478 --> 16:49.413
I will make it back in the group!
A comeback!

16:50.048 --> 16:52.608
Now, Upasocon, finish them off!.

16:52.651 --> 16:53.345
Roger!

16:53.385 --> 16:54.875
PINK SUGAR...

16:54.920 --> 16:58.048
...HEART ATTACK!

17:01.660 --> 17:02.991
Sailor Moon! Now!

17:03.428 --> 17:04.292
Right!

17:06.231 --> 17:08.290
CRISIS...

17:08.333 --> 17:10.733
MAKE UP!

17:37.896 --> 17:41.696
RAINBOW...

17:41.733 --> 17:43.098
...MOON...

17:43.135 --> 17:46.104
...HEART ACHE!

17:52.477 --> 17:53.910
Careless!

17:58.650 --> 18:03.246
Love-Lovely!

18:07.659 --> 18:10.093
Now, Mimet, give up!

18:14.466 --> 18:15.728
What are you talking about?

18:15.767 --> 18:18.099
Do you have that much strength left?

18:19.504 --> 18:21.972
I still have the ultimate weapon!

18:22.407 --> 18:23.738
What!?

18:23.875 --> 18:25.968
WITCHES...

18:26.478 --> 18:27.911
...ELECTRIC...

18:27.946 --> 18:30.346
...WARP!

18:33.719 --> 18:34.743
She disappeared?

18:34.786 --> 18:37.584
What's going on?

18:38.590 --> 18:40.581
W-Where is she?

18:40.625 --> 18:44.721
Now, Mimet will be
perform in gonstage!

18:58.710 --> 18:59.802
Were you surprised?

18:59.845 --> 19:03.281
But it's not just my
body that grew bigger.

19:03.315 --> 19:07.877
This machine makes my powers
tens of times as strong as well!

19:07.919 --> 19:09.511
It feels so good...

19:09.554 --> 19:14.218
To see me on stage like this,
you guys are really lucky!

19:14.760 --> 19:17.558
Now, let's go!

19:17.929 --> 19:20.193
Wonderful, Mimet...
You really are wonderful.

19:20.232 --> 19:22.996
T-That voice...!! Telulu!

19:23.235 --> 19:27.729
But it's not good to take someone
else's work away, you know...

19:27.773 --> 19:30.606
S-Shut up!
Don't get in my wary!

19:30.642 --> 19:35.079
Do you know why our old chief
Eugeal didn't use that machine...?

19:35.547 --> 19:36.878
T-That's...!!

19:36.915 --> 19:39.110
Yup. One thing about that machine...

19:39.151 --> 19:44.589
When you turn off the power while you're in
the monitor, you're trapped in there forever.

19:44.923 --> 19:46.288
S-Stop!

19:46.324 --> 19:47.757
Please, stop!

19:47.793 --> 19:49.124
Come on, I'll apologize!

19:49.161 --> 19:51.186
Any thing but that!

19:51.229 --> 19:54.687
Just don't pull that plug!

19:54.733 --> 19:56.394
Farewell, idiot.

19:57.102 --> 20:00.162
NOOOOO!!!

20:08.380 --> 20:10.109
F-Fighting amongst themselves...?

20:10.148 --> 20:13.140
What in the world is going on?

20:13.185 --> 20:14.550
Super Sailor Moon!?

20:14.586 --> 20:15.382
Are you all right!

20:15.420 --> 20:16.751
Hang in there!

20:16.788 --> 20:17.948
I'm all right...

20:17.989 --> 20:20.184
I'm just a little tired...

20:23.184 --> 20:27.184
