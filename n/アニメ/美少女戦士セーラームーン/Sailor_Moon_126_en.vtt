00:01.800 --> 00:05.031
Haruka, Michiru...
please undo your transformations!

00:05.904 --> 00:09.169
Will we never understand each other?

00:09.207 --> 00:11.767
We can't feel each other's warmth?

00:11.810 --> 00:15.837
Are we going to bicker and
stay enemies until the end?

00:15.881 --> 00:20.250
Uranus, Neptune...
undo your transformations!

00:36.800 --> 00:39.200
Hotaru!!

01:47.938 --> 01:49.371
Sailor Moon!

01:58.281 --> 02:00.545
Sailor Moon!

02:01.918 --> 02:03.408
Sailor Moon! Hang in there!

02:03.453 --> 02:06.547
- Are you all right?
- Hold onto my shoulder...

02:29.780 --> 02:31.077
Chibiusa...!

02:32.115 --> 02:34.174
Usagi... Mamo-chan...

02:34.217 --> 02:35.377
I'm so glad...

02:36.186 --> 02:38.654
Hotaru... Where's Hotaru?

02:41.591 --> 02:44.719
You're kidding...
you're kidding, right?

02:44.761 --> 02:47.662
Hotaru came and visited me!

02:48.031 --> 02:51.330
In my dream... she said thanks...

02:54.204 --> 02:55.432
Chibiusa...

02:55.472 --> 02:58.066
It's all right.
I'm sure she is alive.

02:58.642 --> 03:00.269
Mamo-chan...

03:00.310 --> 03:01.368
That's right!

03:01.411 --> 03:05.040
Sailor Moon risked her life
to protect Hotaru back there!

03:05.649 --> 03:09.210
I'm sure... that she's safe
somewhere out there.

03:09.252 --> 03:11.777
Yeah, I know.
It's all right...

03:11.822 --> 03:13.790
I won't cry anymore.

03:13.824 --> 03:16.486
Usagi, you did your best, right?

03:16.526 --> 03:17.550
Chibiusa...!

03:19.129 --> 03:22.292
Chibiusa!

03:23.533 --> 03:25.501
Good morning!

03:25.535 --> 03:27.162
- Good morning!
- Now, hurry!

03:27.204 --> 03:28.728
The bus is going to leave!

03:28.772 --> 03:30.797
Chibiusa!

03:31.675 --> 03:35.805
- I'll be going now!
- Hurry, hurry!

03:36.680 --> 03:39.012
Usagi...

03:41.685 --> 03:45.177
She's really trying too hard...

03:45.222 --> 03:48.919
In reality, she's worried
sick about Hotaru...

03:49.326 --> 03:51.419
Chibiusa is caring
about others, too.

03:51.461 --> 03:55.022
Even if she cried over it,
all it would do is trouble you, Usagi.

03:55.065 --> 04:00.162
We can't find Sailor Pluto's
whereabouts, nor Hotaru's...

04:00.737 --> 04:04.195
Mina, Makoto, and the others are
doing their best to look for them!

04:04.241 --> 04:05.230
But...

04:05.275 --> 04:07.675
No, I won't give up...

04:09.045 --> 04:12.708
Back then, I did feel Hotaru's warmth...

04:13.617 --> 04:15.676
I still remember it clearly...

04:16.419 --> 04:19.320
We'll see her again...
I'm sure of it!

04:27.731 --> 04:31.030
I'll see you again, I'm sure...

04:47.818 --> 04:49.615
You look so picturesque.

04:49.653 --> 04:53.111
Perhaps it would be nice for the three of
us to live peacefully like this as a family.

04:53.156 --> 04:54.680
Come on...!

04:56.526 --> 04:58.050
Well, it's time.

04:58.094 --> 04:59.857
Yes.

04:59.896 --> 05:01.727
It's farewell, baby...

05:40.170 --> 05:44.197
Ryouichi and Masako Hidaka,
please come to window 4...

05:44.241 --> 05:47.267
Really, what a plump and cute baby!

05:47.744 --> 05:50.542
I'm sure she'll grow up to
be a precocious little girl!

05:55.485 --> 05:56.782
You have a visitor...

06:01.291 --> 06:03.691
Mr. Tomoe.

06:23.346 --> 06:25.712
Hotaru...

06:27.250 --> 06:31.584
Mr. Soichi Tomoe's
amnesia is rather serious...

06:32.355 --> 06:37.088
He has a severe mental trauma
on top of his head injuries...

06:37.761 --> 06:42.858
Fortunately, he's recovering well, so he won't
face any problems returning to society...

06:42.899 --> 06:48.360
But, most of his memory from the past
few years only remains in fragments.

06:51.675 --> 06:54.610
Hm, what's wrong?

06:56.346 --> 06:57.779
What's wrong?

06:57.814 --> 07:00.612
It's strange...
It feels so lonely...

07:01.785 --> 07:03.275
Let's go...

07:03.320 --> 07:08.622
Before we leave that town,
we have one more thing to do.

07:28.345 --> 07:30.711
Chibiusa!

07:32.582 --> 07:34.573
What's wrong?
You don't look too cheerful.

07:34.617 --> 07:37.211
No, I'm fine and full of energy!

07:37.253 --> 07:39.050
Hey, let's go!

07:42.125 --> 07:43.820
Go on ahead!
I'll catch right up with you!

07:43.860 --> 07:44.986
Sure!

07:59.809 --> 08:01.606
Plu...?

08:01.644 --> 08:03.236
Plu!!

08:04.414 --> 08:06.211
You did very well.

08:06.249 --> 08:08.274
I want to hold you
and congratulate you.

08:08.318 --> 08:11.685
But, I no longer have
a physical body in this world.

08:11.721 --> 08:14.918
Plu! Don't say that, come back...

08:14.958 --> 08:19.588
Hotaru isn't here, either...
I'm all alone now!

08:19.629 --> 08:23.395
That is not true.
You have wonderful friends.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.268
And, Sailor Saturn...

08:26.636 --> 08:30.265
Hotaru... is she all right?
Is she alive!?

08:30.807 --> 08:36.768
Within Hotaru, two personalities resided.
Sailor Saturn and...

08:36.813 --> 08:39.646
...Mistress Nine of the Death Busters.

08:39.682 --> 08:45.018
However, Hotaru was able to annihilate
Mistress Nine using Sailor Moon's help...

08:46.589 --> 08:54.121
She has been reincarnated on this beautiful
planet and is about to relive a new life.

08:54.864 --> 08:56.092
Don't go...!!

08:57.233 --> 09:02.034
I will see you once again... someday.
My Small Lady... take care...

09:02.072 --> 09:04.597
Don't go, Plu!!

09:10.847 --> 09:12.610
Oh, is this yours?

09:14.317 --> 09:16.615
Yes... I'm sorry to trouble you.

09:18.221 --> 09:19.916
Hotaru's...

09:19.956 --> 09:22.322
...dad...

09:55.458 --> 09:56.550
Here.

09:56.593 --> 09:57.821
T-Thank you...

09:59.796 --> 10:01.229
Whoa there...

10:01.264 --> 10:03.824
She likes you.

10:11.474 --> 10:14.739
Isn't she cute?
She's my daughter.

10:14.777 --> 10:15.573
What's her name?

10:15.612 --> 10:17.637
Oh, her name is Hotaru.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.944
Right, Hotaru?

10:21.451 --> 10:22.850
Hotaru...

10:23.686 --> 10:30.353
She has been reincarnated on this beautiful
planet and is about to relive a new life.

10:31.094 --> 10:32.857
Mr. Tomoe!

10:37.901 --> 10:38.663
Um...

10:40.370 --> 10:42.270
I hope the baby stays healthy!

10:42.305 --> 10:43.033
Yeah!

10:43.072 --> 10:45.040
Bye-bye!

10:47.644 --> 10:49.043
Hotaru...

10:52.215 --> 10:54.945
I'm happy for you, Hotaru.

10:55.919 --> 10:58.012
I'll see you again, right?

10:58.054 --> 10:59.783
Until then...

10:59.822 --> 11:01.050
Bye-bye...

11:24.547 --> 11:25.775
No good.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.943
The other dimension
is completely gone.

11:28.985 --> 11:30.850
There isn't even a trace of it.

11:30.887 --> 11:33.822
I thought we could get some clue...

11:34.490 --> 11:36.651
Hey, how was it?

11:36.693 --> 11:40.254
Nothing. It's just a normal
building after detonation.

11:40.296 --> 11:41.558
Same here.

11:41.598 --> 11:46.558
We walked all around town,
but we had no clues concerning Hotaru.

11:48.037 --> 11:50.335
Hey, why are you depressed!?

11:50.773 --> 11:55.233
Usagi, you did the best that you could!
Come on, cheer up!

12:04.787 --> 12:06.254
Luna!

12:10.360 --> 12:12.692
What's wrong...?

12:39.022 --> 12:40.148
Don't come here...

12:40.189 --> 12:41.554
Sailor Moon!

12:47.230 --> 12:49.289
Usagi...

12:49.332 --> 12:52.495
Your idealism is too painful to watch.

12:52.535 --> 12:53.866
Michiru...?

12:56.906 --> 12:59.374
Why yes, the world was saved.

12:59.409 --> 13:02.537
But... we can't forgive
you for what you did!

13:02.578 --> 13:06.878
Your idealism in protecting the Warrior
of Ruin almost destroyed this planet...

13:09.519 --> 13:11.350
Usagi, you...

13:11.387 --> 13:13.378
...have no qualifications
to be the future queen!

13:15.325 --> 13:16.553
Oh, how horrible!

13:16.592 --> 13:18.423
I thought we understood each other!

13:18.461 --> 13:20.395
Haruka!

13:20.430 --> 13:21.829
Wait, guys.

13:21.864 --> 13:24.389
Just like we initially
thought these guys...

13:24.434 --> 13:27.562
...are so hardheaded
that it's beyond our reach!

13:29.105 --> 13:32.563
Will you try to bend
these tough heads?

13:35.345 --> 13:36.403
Are you picking a fight!?

13:40.516 --> 13:43.451
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

13:43.553 --> 13:45.885
MAKE UP!

13:46.322 --> 13:48.688
URANUS PLANET POWER...

13:48.725 --> 13:51.023
MAKE UP!

14:18.054 --> 14:20.614
Let's go!

14:22.658 --> 14:25.320
JUPITER STAR POWER...

14:25.862 --> 14:28.729
MARS STAR POWER...

14:28.765 --> 14:29.561
Don't...!

14:30.199 --> 14:32.929
VENUS STAR POWER...

14:33.403 --> 14:35.928
MERCURY STAR POWER...

14:36.606 --> 14:37.937
MAKE UP!

15:06.402 --> 15:08.029
Uranus! Neptune!

15:08.070 --> 15:13.064
I have no grudge against you,
but I can't tolerate you criticizing Usagi!

15:13.643 --> 15:16.806
Sailor Moon fought to
the best of her ability!

15:17.046 --> 15:18.809
Everyone, stop!!

15:20.149 --> 15:23.516
I don't want everyone to fight...

15:23.953 --> 15:25.045
Please stop...

15:26.255 --> 15:28.052
You really are a hopeless idealist.

15:28.491 --> 15:29.480
Usagi...?

15:29.525 --> 15:32.323
Aren't you upset after
all that they've said!?

15:32.628 --> 15:34.789
I'm not upset at all.

15:34.831 --> 15:36.822
Because it's true.

15:36.866 --> 15:39.357
I'm a crybaby... and naive...

15:39.402 --> 15:41.393
But...

15:41.437 --> 15:43.337
I don't think I've done anything wrong!

15:44.240 --> 15:47.835
Sailor Saturn may have
been the Warrior of Ruin...

15:49.312 --> 15:51.837
...but she is still one
of us Sailor Soldiers!

15:52.515 --> 15:57.350
I was happy that we could understand
each other, to feel each other's warmth!

15:57.753 --> 16:00.847
Haruka, Michiru,
please undo your transformations!

16:01.457 --> 16:02.856
Everyone else, too!

16:03.159 --> 16:04.854
Usagi...

16:05.328 --> 16:08.229
If you want us to,
you have to force us to.

16:08.264 --> 16:11.961
Unless you do,
we will be enemies forever...

16:12.001 --> 16:12.865
Usagi...

16:14.470 --> 16:15.869
All right...

16:19.809 --> 16:20.867
Usagi!

16:21.744 --> 16:23.268
Don't help me.

16:23.312 --> 16:24.870
This is my responsibility...

16:27.216 --> 16:30.208
MOON COSMIC POWER...

16:30.253 --> 16:32.585
MAKE UP!

17:03.219 --> 17:05.721
It's finally time for
the main character to appear.

17:05.721 --> 17:06.915
We won't go easy on you.

17:10.626 --> 17:12.958
DEEP...

17:12.995 --> 17:14.485
...SUBMERGE!!

17:21.270 --> 17:22.737
Sailor Moon!

17:24.607 --> 17:26.472
Tuxedo Mask!

17:29.579 --> 17:32.673
For two hearts to truly
understand each other...

17:32.715 --> 17:35.809
...sometimes harsh
collisions are necessary.

17:35.851 --> 17:38.046
No need to interrupt.

17:44.226 --> 17:47.127
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to cry?

17:47.163 --> 17:49.654
Princess Crybaby.

17:49.699 --> 17:52.167
Undo... your transformations!

17:55.104 --> 17:57.368
WORLD...

17:57.406 --> 17:59.670
...SHAKING!

18:06.949 --> 18:07.677
Where is she?

18:07.883 --> 18:09.316
Behind you!

18:16.525 --> 18:19.551
Please stop, Uranus!

18:24.233 --> 18:26.701
Rather amazing.

18:28.270 --> 18:28.998
Sailor Moon!

18:29.605 --> 18:32.005
This is it, Sailor Moon!

18:42.785 --> 18:43.581
What!?

19:00.336 --> 19:02.827
Uranus, Neptune...?

19:05.207 --> 19:07.607
Nothing less from the Princess...

19:07.643 --> 19:10.635
No, the future Neo Queen Serenity.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.343
We have been shown with your
true powers in the very end.

19:15.651 --> 19:16.845
The very end...?

19:17.219 --> 19:21.121
Everything we need to
do in this town is now over.

19:21.624 --> 19:25.856
We found the true Messiah,
and the Earth has been saved.

19:25.895 --> 19:28.363
Our mission has been completed.

19:28.631 --> 19:31.862
The true Messiah... who is it?

19:32.768 --> 19:34.793
Sheesh, there she goes again.

19:34.837 --> 19:38.864
She even draws the
Warrior of Ruin onto her side.

19:40.076 --> 19:41.373
Uranus!

19:41.410 --> 19:42.206
Neptune!

19:43.112 --> 19:45.672
Since we came to this town,
it's been a series of battles.

19:45.715 --> 19:48.275
It was a rather tough everyday life,
right, Neptune?

19:48.317 --> 19:50.285
But it was worth it.

19:50.319 --> 19:55.052
Yeah... It wasn't just Sailor Saturn
that was saved by the messiah.

19:55.091 --> 19:58.219
We were, as well.
I guess I should say... "Thank you"...

19:58.461 --> 20:01.726
Wait... tell me one thing...

20:02.131 --> 20:05.225
Is Hotaru... alive?

20:05.935 --> 20:07.459
I'm sure you'll see her again.

20:07.970 --> 20:10.495
So she's alive...!!

20:10.539 --> 20:12.234
I'm so glad...!

20:15.234 --> 20:19.234
