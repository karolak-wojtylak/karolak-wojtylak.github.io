WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.868
Please, Haruka... Michiru...

00:05.903 --> 00:09.600
Stop chasing after
someone's pure heart...

00:09.640 --> 00:12.268
I'm sure we can work it out.

00:12.310 --> 00:14.710
Because we are the same...
We're Sailor Soldiers!

00:14.746 --> 00:18.011
Even if we don't have the talismans,
we can save the world!

00:18.049 --> 00:19.812
I'll show you.
I'll save the world!

00:54.000 --> 00:56.161
So unfair of you...

00:56.203 --> 00:59.331
...to go off into your own world.

01:02.309 --> 01:03.833
Don't leave me here...

01:08.448 --> 01:11.076
I saw... a dream this morning...

01:11.118 --> 01:12.244
Yeah...

01:12.285 --> 01:15.345
I feel it even after I'm fully awake...

01:15.388 --> 01:17.049
I've never felt this way before...

01:17.090 --> 01:18.682
You're right...

01:19.359 --> 01:21.691
Then... You noticed it too...

01:22.062 --> 01:24.690
Of course I noticed...

01:25.966 --> 01:30.198
I'm sure of it...
Today, a talisman will appear...

01:46.386 --> 01:48.684
This should allow me to specify
the owners of pure hearts...

01:48.722 --> 01:51.054
...that have the talismans
hidden in them for sure.

01:57.497 --> 01:58.395
Ouch!

01:58.431 --> 01:59.557
Ouch...

02:02.569 --> 02:05.834
Who would do such a thing...?

02:06.239 --> 02:10.335
That really hurt
because I was barefoot...

02:14.181 --> 02:16.081
What's this?

02:22.856 --> 02:27.190
What are the lab snails
doing in my locker...!?

02:30.564 --> 02:33.556
Snail Woman in the Station Wagon
Should Crash and Die!!

02:34.668 --> 02:39.503
Hey, did you hear?
Chief Eugeal failed again!

02:40.073 --> 02:45.477
Oh, my... she made waste of yet another
Daimohn that we had the professor make us?

02:45.512 --> 02:48.310
She's so calculating,
but she's more like Klutzeal.

02:48.715 --> 02:52.014
Really... I would like
old hags to just retire.

02:52.052 --> 02:56.182
You shouldn't say that, guys... Don't
say such bad things about our chief...

02:56.223 --> 02:59.090
Maybe it's finally my turn next!

02:59.125 --> 03:01.252
Sorry to break your bubble!

03:01.294 --> 03:07.164
I got a phone call from the professor
today, saying he wanted to talk to me!

03:07.200 --> 03:08.132
Not fair!

03:08.168 --> 03:11.137
Why were you the only one to
get such a phone call, Mimet!?

03:18.578 --> 03:23.277
Dammit... How dare they
Make such fun of me!

03:23.316 --> 03:26.843
They forget exactly WHO
taught them their work...

03:28.455 --> 03:29.888
Especially Mimet!

03:29.923 --> 03:31.356
I can't forgive her!

03:32.225 --> 03:34.887
She always acts so
cutesy in front of me...

03:34.928 --> 03:37.260
She really has two different faces...

03:37.297 --> 03:41.358
I'm sure SHE'S the one who
put the snails in my locker!

03:42.168 --> 03:43.965
Fortunately, today is a holiday...

03:44.004 --> 03:46.438
If I can resume work
with talisman in hand...

03:46.473 --> 03:49.601
...the next executive
chair will be MINE...

03:49.643 --> 03:54.171
And then, I'll show them... I'll make
sure they all suffer working for me!

03:54.681 --> 03:55.648
All right!

03:55.682 --> 03:57.775
This will allow me to
see who has a talisman!

04:02.222 --> 04:07.285
But who in the world has the purest
heart to hide a talisman...!?

04:09.696 --> 04:13.689
So this... is the
owner of a talisman...?

04:26.813 --> 04:32.115
We're not home right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.

04:33.887 --> 04:37.482
Hello, is this
Haruka Tenoh's residence?

04:37.524 --> 04:42.552
This is Eugeal... I wanted to
thank you for all your hard work.

04:42.595 --> 04:43.994
Are you surprised?

04:44.030 --> 04:46.157
It's easy for me to
figure out where you are...

04:46.199 --> 04:48.963
...now that you have shown
your true identities tome!

04:49.002 --> 04:50.867
I'll surprise you even further!

04:50.904 --> 04:54.567
I have finally found the
location of a talisman's owner!

04:54.607 --> 04:57.576
I will go take it now!

04:57.610 --> 04:59.510
The battle will be won by--

05:08.755 --> 05:14.057
We're not home right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.

05:15.462 --> 05:17.930
Hey, there cording time
on this is too short!

05:17.964 --> 05:20.091
I couldn't finish
what I wanted to say!

05:21.301 --> 05:24.270
Ah well... so there you have it.

05:24.304 --> 05:27.865
Oh yeah, I hear that you've been
searching for talismans as well.

05:27.907 --> 05:31.035
Depending on the conditions,
I can have you join us.

05:31.077 --> 05:36.606
Don't worry. I haven't told my
boss of your true identities yet.

05:36.649 --> 05:39.550
If you feel up to it, come to
the place I'm going to specify.

05:39.586 --> 05:43.113
I'll send you a map via fax. See ya.

05:49.596 --> 05:53.430
It's probably true that she
found the owner of a talisman.

05:53.466 --> 05:56.128
Yeah, it coincides
with our premonition.

05:57.203 --> 05:58.636
It's finally time...

06:10.049 --> 06:12.882
The sehands have been tainted now...

06:12.919 --> 06:16.616
No matter what methods I take
and what sacrifices I make...

06:16.656 --> 06:20.649
I will make sure to get
a hold of the talismans...

06:21.361 --> 06:23.352
Michiru?

06:40.346 --> 06:42.439
Hey... what's wrong?

06:42.982 --> 06:44.415
Haruka.

06:44.451 --> 06:46.112
It's all right...

06:46.152 --> 06:49.144
I like your hands.

06:57.297 --> 06:59.993
Talismans... what in
the world are they?

07:00.033 --> 07:03.469
Our objective is to get
a hold of the talismans.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.107
Do you use any means
possible to get them?

07:10.143 --> 07:12.976
That's right...
We use any means we can.

07:17.350 --> 07:20.148
We... can't work this out...?

07:20.186 --> 07:22.916
That's right...
We're going to be enemies...

07:26.626 --> 07:29.151
But we're both the same...
We're Sailor Soldiers.

07:29.195 --> 07:31.993
Stop that... We're looking
for completely different things.

07:39.072 --> 07:42.530
We won't have any regrets,
no matter who we sacrifice...

07:42.575 --> 07:47.512
Even if we have to sacrifice
the owners of those pure hearts...

07:51.684 --> 07:53.242
Hey, idiot! Usagi! Telephone!

07:54.754 --> 07:56.278
It's from someone named Haruka!

08:00.159 --> 08:03.788
Eh? Usako was called out to go
somewhere by Haruka and Michiru?

08:04.430 --> 08:05.556
Is she all right?

08:05.598 --> 08:08.567
I mean, those two are
Uranus and Neptune, right...?

08:08.835 --> 08:10.803
Yeah... but those two...

08:12.739 --> 08:14.934
...aren't bad people, I think...

08:18.645 --> 08:21.273
What's wrong?

08:39.699 --> 08:41.633
This is amazing...

08:42.035 --> 08:45.198
I didn't know there was an aquarium
at the top of this building!

08:45.238 --> 08:47.638
Can I bring my friends here next time?

08:52.645 --> 08:53.634
Can I?

08:59.419 --> 09:01.979
Don't show yours elfin
front of us ever again...

09:02.021 --> 09:04.751
...Sailor Moon.

09:05.725 --> 09:09.286
We... are both the same...
We're Sailor Soldiers.

09:09.329 --> 09:12.196
We can't fight together?

09:15.535 --> 09:20.097
I won't allow you to slow us down
with your half-baked play war...

09:21.641 --> 09:23.131
You can't!

09:27.647 --> 09:29.342
I'll hold onto this...

09:29.782 --> 09:30.749
Wait!

09:30.783 --> 09:34.241
Please, don't go after
people's pure hearts anymore!

09:34.287 --> 09:35.219
Don't say that.

09:35.254 --> 09:39.156
Listen. The next time you show
yours elfin front of us...

09:40.059 --> 09:41.651
...you will die!

09:43.162 --> 09:45.460
URANUS PLANET POWER...

09:45.498 --> 09:47.898
MAKE UP!

09:48.868 --> 09:51.598
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

09:51.638 --> 09:54.038
MAKE UP!

10:17.997 --> 10:22.366
We are searching for the talismans
that are sealed inside pure hearts.

10:22.402 --> 10:26.099
The Holy Grail will not appear unless we
collect all three talismans in one place.

10:26.139 --> 10:30.098
Silence... a time of destruction is
approaching this world right now.

10:30.143 --> 10:33.408
The only one who can save us is the
Messiah, the one who can use the Grail.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.973
Grail? Messiah?

10:36.015 --> 10:38.950
It has nothing to do with you...

10:48.761 --> 10:50.922
Haruka! Michiru!

10:59.639 --> 11:01.937
Will you go rescue them?

11:02.775 --> 11:07.439
They have headed off to the place where
their destined battle will begin...

11:08.047 --> 11:10.948
But today, even those
two are in danger.

11:13.019 --> 11:14.213
You are...?

11:14.253 --> 11:15.584
Setsuna Meioh.

11:15.621 --> 11:18.715
An... old acquaintance... of those two.

11:18.991 --> 11:21.050
Those two are in danger?

11:21.094 --> 11:23.085
Will you go rescue them?

11:23.129 --> 11:27.725
But you might see even graver danger,
as you are unable to transform...

11:28.167 --> 11:31.967
Please! If you know where
I should go, tell me!

11:59.999 --> 12:01.296
I can see it now...

12:01.334 --> 12:02.198
So that's it...?

12:03.269 --> 12:07.763
A church under construction.
A marine cathedral...

12:21.621 --> 12:24.215
We'll finally meet
the owner of a talisman...

12:25.158 --> 12:26.853
Uranus...

12:26.893 --> 12:28.360
You understand...

12:28.394 --> 12:32.421
...that no matter what happens,
we will acquire the talismans...

12:32.465 --> 12:37.334
From here on, we'll ignore each other's
danger, and you'll move on by yourself.

12:37.370 --> 12:39.736
What are you talking
about now, of all times?

12:40.406 --> 12:41.737
You're right...

12:49.315 --> 12:51.476
For someone who invited us,
this is rather unwelcome...

12:58.257 --> 12:59.986
What's wrong? Neptune?

13:05.832 --> 13:07.493
It moved!?

13:07.533 --> 13:08.397
Uranus!

13:13.339 --> 13:16.137
So it was an enemy trap...

13:17.443 --> 13:20.571
Idiot... of course it is.

13:22.381 --> 13:23.871
Game...

13:23.916 --> 13:25.577
START!

13:46.639 --> 13:48.937
WORLD...

13:48.975 --> 13:51.170
...SHAKING!

13:57.316 --> 13:59.614
DEEP...

13:59.652 --> 14:01.279
...SUBMERGE!

14:05.892 --> 14:06.950
How's that?

14:09.161 --> 14:11.391
URANUS!

14:15.868 --> 14:17.802
Neptune!!

14:29.849 --> 14:31.248
Sailor Uranus!

14:31.284 --> 14:33.752
Now, I have the owner of a talisman!

14:33.786 --> 14:35.083
What are you talking about!?

14:36.222 --> 14:38.588
I really fell for it as well...

14:38.824 --> 14:42.191
But then, not even
you had realized it...

14:42.228 --> 14:43.354
What in the world
are you talking about!?

14:43.896 --> 14:45.420
I'll tell you...

14:45.464 --> 14:49.594
The owner of a talisman is
your partner, Sailor Neptune!

14:51.370 --> 14:54.271
I will soon extract
the talisman from Neptune.

14:54.307 --> 14:58.607
How do you feel about that? If you
want to watch, come to the main hall...

15:01.247 --> 15:04.045
Neptune is the owner of a talisman!?

15:04.083 --> 15:05.778
That's impossible!

15:24.770 --> 15:26.101
Neptune...

15:26.672 --> 15:28.367
NEPTUNE!!

15:38.451 --> 15:39.475
You fell for it!

15:42.722 --> 15:45.350
Fool, when someone other
than myself walks across...

15:45.391 --> 15:47.985
...this bridge, they receive
divine punishment!!

15:48.260 --> 15:49.989
Divine... punishment?

15:52.598 --> 15:57.194
Don't worry. I haven't pulled
out Neptune's talisman yet...

15:57.236 --> 15:59.761
I must pull the talisman out
of ANOTHER person first...

16:00.239 --> 16:02.537
Another owner of a talisman!?

16:02.575 --> 16:04.770
I mean, YOU!

16:05.745 --> 16:08.509
I'm talking about your heart...

16:08.547 --> 16:11.914
The one that tried to save the world,
without fear of soiling one's hands.

16:15.755 --> 16:16.687
Uranus...

16:18.124 --> 16:21.560
Talismans are sealed
within pure hearts...

16:21.594 --> 16:23.755
There is no way I could
be holding a talisman...

16:23.796 --> 16:25.696
You'll see soon enough...

16:25.731 --> 16:30.191
Although with those wounds,
the force from this gun will kill you.

16:34.273 --> 16:35.706
URANUS!

16:53.192 --> 16:56.286
Haruka... I won't let you die...

16:56.328 --> 16:58.819
Wait, Neptune!! Don't move!

17:12.411 --> 17:13.673
NEPTUNE!

17:16.115 --> 17:17.173
Haruka...

17:21.520 --> 17:23.181
They're out of bullets.

17:57.756 --> 18:00.725
So this is a talisman.
I'll take yours next!

18:01.193 --> 18:05.493
We are the ones in whom
the talismans were sealed...

18:05.531 --> 18:07.123
O Messiah...

18:07.166 --> 18:10.795
Is this the punishment we get...?

18:12.204 --> 18:13.228
Hold it right there!

18:20.980 --> 18:21.708
Messiah...

18:24.049 --> 18:25.038
You're...!

18:34.093 --> 18:36.425
Drats!!

18:42.668 --> 18:46.001
Hold yourself together, Michiru!

18:46.272 --> 18:49.935
Please, talisman!
Turn back to Michiru's heart crystal!!

18:49.975 --> 18:51.499
Please stop that...

18:52.778 --> 18:55.645
We've found the talisman.
This is the way it should be...

18:55.681 --> 18:56.841
Impossible!

18:56.882 --> 18:58.509
Then, Michiru is...

19:01.053 --> 19:03.385
You're so unfair, Michiru...

19:03.422 --> 19:06.323
To leave for a world of your own...

19:08.561 --> 19:10.529
I'll return that to you...

19:10.563 --> 19:13.657
You really were reckless.
You knew you couldn't transform.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.299
You can't!

19:16.335 --> 19:18.166
- Let go!
- Stop that!

19:18.204 --> 19:21.469
There is another talisman inside me!

19:21.507 --> 19:24.670
Even if we don't have the talismans,
we can save the world!

19:24.710 --> 19:25.438
What!?

19:25.945 --> 19:29.108
I'll... save the world...

19:30.749 --> 19:35.686
It's strange... when you say it,
it really feels like you will...

19:36.455 --> 19:39.947
A few minutes ago... for some reason,
you looked like the Messiah...

19:40.426 --> 19:44.294
...although I don't
believe in your powers...

19:44.330 --> 19:46.389
Haruka...

19:49.034 --> 19:50.626
Sailor Moon.

19:50.669 --> 19:54.628
Please make sure to find
the last talisman, too...

19:54.673 --> 19:56.402
Stop!!

20:14.460 --> 20:15.927
This can't be...

20:23.435 --> 20:26.097
Haruka... Michiru...

20:29.097 --> 20:33.097
