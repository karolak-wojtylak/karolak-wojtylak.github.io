1
00:00:02,382 --> 00:00:06,148
Ami, you've been weird lately.
Something worrying you?

2
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:08,211
Hey, you can talk to
me about anything.

3
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:12,453
Perhaps a clumsy girl
like me can't do much...

4
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:14,983
...but I'll do
everything I can.

5
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:17,792
Bad kids who make fun
of my precious friends...

6
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:20,162
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,433
Oh, Mizuno.

8
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:28,992
Yes?

9
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:31,301
This was in the
audio/video room.

10
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,239
Oh, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:36,402
It's unlike you to forget
a guidebook somewhere.

12
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:38,639
Is something bothering you?

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,671
Oh, no, not really.

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,509
This year is finally the
year of the entrance exams.

15
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:46,075
I have high hopes for you.
Do your best.

16
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:49,085
Oh, Ami.

17
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:51,091
I heard rumors
that you've been...

18
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:54,458
...taking care of
delinquent students lately.

19
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:59,864
I hope they aren't getting
in the way of your studies.

20
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:05,863
If you ever feel like they're
dragging you down...

21
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:11,805
...you can come talk to
me about it at any time.

22
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:13,507
Even for you,
vice-principal...

23
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:15,948
...I don't think "dragging me
down" is a good thing to say.

24
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:17,975
Oh, no! That's just
a play on words.

25
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:21,682
Well, I just want you to
concentrate on your academics.

26
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,852
I'll see you around.

27
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,190
Dragging her down...

28
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:28,661
I guess that's true.

29
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:30,488
Hey, I finally found you!

30
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:31,896
Oh, Naru.

31
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:34,731
You promised you'd buy me pizza
for letting you copy my homework.

32
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,237
I won't let you say that
you've already forgotten.

33
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:38,795
Oh, was that the case?

34
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:40,841
Umino's share, too.

35
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,148
Only on my academics...

36
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:10,769
Hey.

37
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:12,568
Mamoru...

38
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:15,542
What's the matter?
You look dazed there.

39
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:18,107
Something worrying you?

40
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,879
That's not like
you somehow...

41
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:22,815
Mamoru...

42
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,843
What do you think is left of
me if you took academics away?

43
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:29,186
Huh? What do you mean?

44
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:32,624
I'm sorry for asking
such a strange question.

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,288
But, I've been
thinking lately...

46
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,991
My mother is a doctor,
so I decided at an early age...

47
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,125
...that I wanted to
become a doctor myself.

48
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:43,763
And I've been studying without
a doubt to become one.

49
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:48,637
I thought that becoming a good
doctor was my dream, but...

50
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:51,408
It's not?

51
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,938
I've been feeling that I
really have no dream at all.

52
00:02:54,982 --> 00:02:56,449
Why?

53
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:59,647
I think becoming a good
doctor is a wonderful dream.

54
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:04,987
But people with real
dreams shine brighter.

55
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:07,792
Usagi, for example,
is full of dreams...

56
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:12,026
She shines so brightly
that I can't even compare.

57
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,661
True, she does have more than
the average amount of dreams.

58
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:17,694
The only thing I
have is academics.

59
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:20,764
Maybe I can't become
a good doctor like that.

60
00:03:22,877 --> 00:03:25,675
But that's a shame.

61
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:27,806
If it's a cute doctor like you...

62
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,649
...I was thinking that I could
bear getting a shot or two.

63
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:34,553
Mamoru, you dislike
getting shots?

64
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:37,991
I hate it.

65
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,418
- Is that funny?
- Yes, it's funny.

66
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:43,327
You think so?

67
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:49,134
Thank you. I feel a
little bit better now.

68
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,333
That's good. Is the study
group about to begin?

69
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:53,533
Yes...

70
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:56,668
Oh, but I'm going to go swim in
the pool for a bit before that.

71
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:57,676
See you.

72
00:03:57,712 --> 00:03:58,974
Yeah.

73
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:04,082
You shine enough
just the way you are.

74
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:10,051
That is the famous
genius girl...

75
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:13,621
Then she must have a pure
heart full of confidence...

76
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:16,528
...and skills that shine.

77
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:36,442
Nobody's here.
Like it's reserved just for me.

78
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:58,235
She swims so vibrantly.

79
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:13,313
Beautiful...

80
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,126
Hello.

81
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:24,791
You came from a world of
water in your past life as well.

82
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,761
I don't know...

83
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:37,067
Let's have a race.

84
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,436
Ready...

85
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,771
- To the other side.
- Sure.

86
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:43,407
Go!

87
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:51,655
She's fast!

88
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:12,442
A tie.

89
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:18,452
Um...

90
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,725
Why did you slow down?

91
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,126
Were you trying to
make me feel better?

92
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,829
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way...

93
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:38,633
I'm sorry!

94
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,439
Oh?

95
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:44,967
Oh, boy, you made her cry.

96
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:46,411
I didn't mean to...

97
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,938
She just wanted
to be friends.

98
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:51,681
Since she's the type that
isn't confident in herself...

99
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:54,220
...she unconsciously avoided
a confrontation.

100
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:56,086
And you made fun of that.

101
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,750
I just wanted to say that...

102
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,659
...I wanted to race her
with all of our strength.

103
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:03,160
Sheesh...

104
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:07,723
Still, I feel sorry
for her like this.

105
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:16,871
I'm good for nothing...

106
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:24,651
What did this
proverb mean again?

107
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:26,585
Oh, I know, I know.

108
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,989
It's something about Fukusuke
coming back for O-bon or not.

109
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:32,959
You mean, "spilt water never
comes back to the bon (tray)."

110
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:34,927
Oh, yeah, that one!

111
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:37,526
Hey, Ami, about this one?!

112
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:39,590
- The special-case verbs that start with k!
- Does a related object mean...

113
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:45,402
Guys! Studying should be
done with your own abilities!

114
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:47,330
Usagi is...

115
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:49,535
...saying something decent!

116
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,909
Do you want me to
take your temperature?

117
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,445
WHY!?

118
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:56,712
Usagi, it's all right.

119
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:58,981
Everyone should keep
asking the questions.

120
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,180
A no is a no!

121
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:07,288
Ami has to study more and
more to become a doctor!

122
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,519
She's not like us!

123
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:14,000
From now on, I, Usagi, will not
allow anyone to get in her way!

124
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:15,802
Usagi!

125
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:17,929
It's all right, so don't
worry about it!

126
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:21,339
Ami, you just have to study!

127
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,967
Just study...?

128
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,208
That's true...

129
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:29,782
Thanks, Usagi.

130
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,308
Oh, but I forgot
something. I'll go get it.

131
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,479
Really?

132
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,487
Yeah.

133
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,064
Usagi's enthusiastic
about studying...

134
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,762
...and Ami forgot something...?

135
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:50,361
It's the opposite of usual.

136
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,872
Well, let's do
our best studying.

137
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,501
Before Usagi's
enthusiasm fades away.

138
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:57,010
I forgot something, too!

139
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,813
What is going on?!

140
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,350
What should I do?
Did I say something bad?

141
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:12,456
Even Usagi told me to
just do academics...

142
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,990
But I really don't
have anything else...

143
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:21,791
I'm so sick of this.

144
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:27,397
Hey.

145
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:32,243
My partner wants a rematch.

146
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,840
Oh, don't run away and
cause me more trouble.

147
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:38,875
Here, I'll take you
to the sports center.

148
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,149
That's fine. I'll walk there!

149
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,218
Suit yourself...

150
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:47,461
It's a nice sunset.

151
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:48,519
You think so?

152
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:50,996
Is it not that great..?

153
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,464
Oh?

154
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,531
Ami.

155
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:59,971
Ami should be studying with
everyone else right about now.

156
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:03,067
- But that really was Ami.
- Hey, Luna!

157
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:17,657
A new Daimohn egg
has been completed.

158
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:22,387
Go, in search of a pure heart!

159
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:59,792
I'm glad you could come,
Miss Ami Mizuno.

160
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,734
Or did Haruka force
you to come over?

161
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,295
I came on my own will.

162
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,604
I'm sorry if I made you feel
bad by what happened earlier.

163
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:11,042
Or is it that
you're mocking me?

164
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,270
All I want to do
is have a rematch.

165
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,048
I hope you'll accept.

166
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:21,016
Ami went to
the sports center?

167
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,545
Why?

168
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,388
I don't know, but Luna's
watching over her now.

169
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:27,824
Let's go there, Artemis.

170
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,658
- All right, then follow me.
- Sure!

171
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,267
I hope nothing
serious happens.

172
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:38,166
Ami...

173
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,504
100-meter freestyle
should be enough.

174
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,634
Yes.

175
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:45,076
Ready...

176
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:00,691
She's fast!

177
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:03,856
She really is amazing...
But I won't lose!

178
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,797
She's smiling!?

179
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,909
They're even.

180
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:24,047
I've never met someone
like this before. I might lose.

181
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:30,455
Why am I putting so much
effort into this right now?

182
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:32,755
Is it because I
don't want to lose?

183
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:36,822
No, it's because I
don't want to run away.

184
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:41,562
If I don't give it everything
here, I'll end up running away...

185
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,506
It's important to not run away
and give it everything I've got!

186
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:00,182
Tie.

187
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,814
It's a tie.

188
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:06,724
See? Competing with all your
strength isn't a bad thing, is it?

189
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:09,895
You're right.

190
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:22,131
Thank you.

191
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,167
No, thank you.

192
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:27,374
It was fun.
We should do this again.

193
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:44,230
I think I'll go for another swim...

194
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:10,915
Mm-Mm-MON!

195
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:12,720
What?!

196
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:15,226
DOVLIN!

197
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:18,129
I'll take your pure heart...

198
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:21,328
...that's worried by the
doubts in your life!

199
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,272
DOVUN!

200
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,207
Lane 1, Dovlin!

201
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,214
Here I go!

202
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,200
Usagi! It looks like a
Daimohn's appeared!

203
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,472
- Transform!
- Yeah!

204
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:08,946
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

205
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,210
Stop that!

206
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:45,377
DOVUN?

207
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,149
I came here in
search of a friend...

208
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:50,349
...and something unwanted
is misbehaving!

209
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:54,722
For love and justice, the
pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

210
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:56,353
Sailor Moon!

211
00:15:57,965 --> 00:16:01,594
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

212
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:04,899
Sailor Moon!

213
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:09,204
Dovlin! Don't flinch!
Just grab the pure heart!

214
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:10,608
DOVUN!

215
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:15,246
DOVUN!

216
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:32,420
Ami!

217
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:37,163
Hey, give that back!

218
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:41,300
Ami is kinder than anyone!
And she's smart...!

219
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:48,638
She's going to become the
best doctor in the world!

220
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:50,348
And she's my...

221
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,410
My dear friend!

222
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:01,557
This isn't a talisman either!

223
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,699
I won't forgive anyone...

224
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:10,794
...who hurts the pure hearts
of innocent maidens!

225
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:13,101
Tuxedo Mask!

226
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,707
Dovlin, get rid of
these nuisances.

227
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,679
DOVUN!

228
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:32,021
Good thing I was wearing
a floating ring.

229
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:39,023
Damn you!

230
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:44,704
Now, Sailor Moon!

231
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:45,397
Right!

232
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:13,889
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

233
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:28,972
LOVELY!

234
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:43,060
Ami!

235
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,753
Sailor Moon...

236
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:11,423
Ami...

237
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,323
Thank you...

238
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,731
It's a shame, but this one
wasn't a talisman, either.

239
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:23,668
You're glad she's
all right, I bet.

240
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,100
I'm sorry, Ami.

241
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,802
Did I say something that
hurt your feelings?

242
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:31,810
No, it's not that...

243
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:34,540
I was just a
little depressed.

244
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:37,913
But thanks to Sailor Moon,
I think I'll be better now.

245
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:39,383
Thank you so much.

246
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,818
Oh...

247
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:42,947
You're welcome.

248
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:44,354
It looks like you've
gotten over it.

249
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,722
Yes.

250
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,659
I finally understand.

251
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:50,356
It's important to do something
with everything you have.

252
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:55,826
To worry is the same
thing as to stop...

253
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:57,930
So I won't run away.

254
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:59,734
You know...

255
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:02,606
Is this what you
call a "good mood"?

256
00:20:03,944 --> 00:20:09,405
Um, Ami, Tuxedo Mask
here is MY Tuxedo Mask!

257
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:12,577
Oh? I won't
lose there, either!

258
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:14,816
No, you can't! No, no!

259
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:17,653
- I won't lose!
- No, no, no!

260
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:19,318
I won't lose!

261
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,758
No, no, no, NO!

262
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:25,322
- I won't lose!
- No, no, no, NO!!

263
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:29,131
Well, we can't do this forever,
so let's go back and study!

264
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,097
D'oh!

265
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:38,097
