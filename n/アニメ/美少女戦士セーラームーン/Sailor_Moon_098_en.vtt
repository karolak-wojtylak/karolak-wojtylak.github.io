00:02.500 --> 00:04.491
Hey, do you know
about motocross?

00:04.535 --> 00:06.059
It's a really brutal race...

00:06.104 --> 00:08.038
...where you cross bumpy
dirt roads on motorcycles!

00:08.072 --> 00:10.802
Haruka, who loves motorcycles,
is participating as well!

00:10.842 --> 00:14.209
But there are bad guys using
such a race to set a trap!

00:14.245 --> 00:15.906
I won't forgive them!

00:15.947 --> 00:20.247
I, Sailor Moon, will punish
you in the name of the moon!

00:30.320 --> 00:32.811
The five Sailor Soldiers!

00:37.961 --> 00:41.328
And the always unexpected
arrival of that Tuxedo Mask!

00:42.632 --> 00:46.090
They are nothing but a
group of noisy annoyances!

00:46.136 --> 00:48.400
Furthermore, there are
the mysterious soldiers...

00:48.438 --> 00:51.134
...who call themselves
Uranus and Neptune!

00:51.174 --> 00:56.168
These two are seeking the
talismans just like us!

00:56.212 --> 01:00.979
For some reason, these two always
appear wherever Daimohn are.

01:01.751 --> 01:06.450
Perhaps they know what
our plan of attack is.

01:06.523 --> 01:10.789
In that case, use that
and lure them instead!

01:11.094 --> 01:12.356
Yes!

01:12.395 --> 01:15.831
I'll make sure to lure them
both out and annihilate them.

01:46.863 --> 01:47.989
Dammit...

01:48.898 --> 01:50.297
Amazing! Amazing!

01:50.333 --> 01:52.733
Haruka won by such
a huge margin!

01:53.103 --> 01:55.401
Such a superior
riding technique...!

01:55.438 --> 02:00.603
She has a lot of talent to
win against all those boys.

02:00.877 --> 02:02.469
This is a problem...

02:02.512 --> 02:04.446
What's wrong, Ami?

02:04.481 --> 02:07.678
I got so excited that I forgot one
of my English vocabulary words...

02:17.527 --> 02:18.960
Here!

02:18.995 --> 02:20.724
Thanks, Michiru.

02:20.764 --> 02:22.629
Oh, Haruka!

02:23.233 --> 02:26.100
- Oh, buns-head.
- You were here?

02:26.169 --> 02:29.935
Yeah. We were all brought
here by Mamo-chan.

02:36.579 --> 02:40.242
Hey, Haruka Tenoh.
You won, and you're a GIRL!

02:40.283 --> 02:41.978
You're awfully arrogant.

02:42.018 --> 02:44.646
It doesn't matter if
you're male or female.

02:44.721 --> 02:46.086
Whoever is fastest wins.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.589
What?

02:47.624 --> 02:50.058
Are you trying to
threaten a girl?

02:50.093 --> 02:52.789
It's pathetic to
watch losers whine.

02:52.829 --> 02:55.093
- What was that?
- Stop it!

02:55.131 --> 02:56.462
Yamada...

02:56.800 --> 02:59.462
We just have to win the
next race. Let's go.

03:00.437 --> 03:02.735
Just be careful that
you don't get hurt.

03:05.942 --> 03:07.068
Mamo-chan!

03:07.110 --> 03:08.372
Who's he?

03:08.445 --> 03:10.140
Katsutoshi Yamada.

03:10.180 --> 03:13.149
The guy who placed second
in the race that just ended.

03:13.183 --> 03:16.050
He's very passionate
about motocross racing.

03:16.419 --> 03:18.410
A very "pure" individual.

03:20.090 --> 03:23.617
He's the type that would
have a pure heart crystal.

03:23.660 --> 03:26.254
It looks like we should
keep an eye on him.

03:26.329 --> 03:29.594
- Leave it to me!
- Please.

03:32.235 --> 03:35.033
Welcome! Welcome!

03:35.505 --> 03:38.303
These rider dolls are
really popular right now!

03:38.341 --> 03:41.174
And they're just
1000 yen each!

03:41.211 --> 03:43.839
First come, first served!
Come and get them now!

03:43.880 --> 03:45.313
Welcome, welcome.

03:45.348 --> 03:47.578
Hey, it's cute.

03:48.184 --> 03:51.676
Let's see. This feels good!

03:56.526 --> 03:58.858
W-What's this? Wait for me!

04:00.130 --> 04:03.099
- Usagi's over there!
- Oh, Usagi!

04:03.133 --> 04:05.033
She wasn't on this bus?

04:05.101 --> 04:08.070
I didn't realize she wasn't!
What should we do?

04:08.104 --> 04:10.197
She's not a kid.
She'll come later.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.868
Sheesh, she sure
is a troublemaker!

04:19.649 --> 04:22.209
Oh, no... Everyone's gone now.

04:23.586 --> 04:26.248
Let's see,
the next bus is...

04:27.490 --> 04:29.685
I have to wait
another hour!?

04:32.462 --> 04:33.690
Get on.

04:33.730 --> 04:34.662
Haruka!

04:34.697 --> 04:36.995
- I'll take you back.
- B-But...

04:37.033 --> 04:38.796
Don't worry. Come on.

04:38.835 --> 04:41.463
A-All right.
Excuse me, then...

04:41.504 --> 04:43.028
Hold on tight!

05:04.294 --> 05:06.353
He's going for
me on purpose!

05:06.396 --> 05:08.796
Buns-head, make sure you're
holding on really tight!

05:16.706 --> 05:17.468
Dammit!

05:24.147 --> 05:27.878
Sheesh! Why do you have
to be harassed, Haruka?

05:28.184 --> 05:29.981
I think it was those
guys from earlier.

05:30.954 --> 05:32.478
Impossible!

05:33.890 --> 05:35.289
It really IS them!

05:35.325 --> 05:37.486
Dammit, where did they hide?

05:40.964 --> 05:43.990
I feel like I'm in
the arms of a man...

05:44.601 --> 05:47.195
Haruka, you smell
really nice.

05:47.704 --> 05:50.468
U-Um, what cologne do you use?

05:50.640 --> 05:51.470
Quiet!

05:55.311 --> 05:56.801
Do you have something
you need from me?

05:56.846 --> 05:58.438
You! Get her!

05:59.515 --> 06:00.379
Look out!

06:04.954 --> 06:07.218
Stop with the unfair tricks!

06:07.290 --> 06:10.521
Races should be fought
and won fair and square!

06:11.394 --> 06:12.759
Dammit...

06:14.497 --> 06:16.727
Haruka, you're strong!

06:38.621 --> 06:39.952
I'll win!

06:40.423 --> 06:44.450
In the next motocross race,
I'll make sure I win!

07:19.762 --> 07:21.957
So, it was him!

07:22.498 --> 07:25.228
- This is strange.
- Did something break?

07:28.304 --> 07:30.898
Looks like the spark
plug went haywire.

07:36.346 --> 07:39.782
The sea's grown stormy. Get to the
motocross practice area, fast!

07:39.816 --> 07:41.408
Got it!

07:41.451 --> 07:44.545
I have a sudden errand now!
Since my bike's broken...

07:44.587 --> 07:46.612
...I don't think I can take you home.

07:46.656 --> 07:49.352
Head over to the road there and
you can catch a bus to the station.

07:49.392 --> 07:51.917
O-Okay! I can
go home by myself.

07:53.129 --> 07:54.494
I'm sorry!

07:55.198 --> 07:57.098
I wonder what the
sudden errand was?

07:57.133 --> 07:59.693
She seemed a little strange.
I wonder...

08:12.382 --> 08:14.077
TIREN!

08:29.866 --> 08:33.700
I surely have the crystal
of your pure heart, TIREN.

08:33.736 --> 08:36.432
I won't let you
have it your way!

08:36.472 --> 08:37.939
Who are you?

08:39.942 --> 08:41.739
By the stormy
waters of Neptune...

08:41.778 --> 08:45.475
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Neptune...

08:45.515 --> 08:47.176
...acts with grace!

08:51.154 --> 08:55.284
DEEP SUBMERGE!

09:04.600 --> 09:07.296
No, this isn't
a talisman.

09:09.238 --> 09:11.706
Hurry and run to
someplace safe!

09:14.043 --> 09:16.204
I've been waiting
for you, Sailor Neptune!

09:18.281 --> 09:23.048
I don't care if that guy's
crystal is a talisman or not.

09:23.086 --> 09:26.453
We've been waiting
for you to arrive.

09:26.489 --> 09:27.717
What did you say?

09:28.057 --> 09:30.855
DOUBLE TIREN!

09:34.997 --> 09:36.021
What!?

09:47.143 --> 09:48.770
Die!

09:48.811 --> 09:49.937
Wait!

09:53.516 --> 09:55.279
So, Sailor Uranus
is here, too...

09:55.351 --> 09:58.047
Both of you can die together!

09:58.087 --> 10:00.612
Haruka sure runs fast!

10:39.862 --> 10:41.523
TIREN!

10:44.967 --> 10:45.991
All right!

10:48.104 --> 10:53.736
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

11:30.880 --> 11:33.246
Sailor Uranus, don't fight it.

11:33.316 --> 11:35.750
If you fight,
your friend's life is over!

11:35.818 --> 11:36.375
What?

11:51.300 --> 11:53.359
I won't let you do
such an unfair thing!

11:56.439 --> 11:57.838
Who are you?

12:00.810 --> 12:04.041
For love and justice, the
pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

12:04.080 --> 12:05.809
Sailor Moon!

12:06.482 --> 12:07.881
Sailor Moon...

12:08.951 --> 12:11.283
Battles should all
be done fair and square.

12:11.354 --> 12:13.413
I'm not allied
with either of you...

12:13.456 --> 12:15.549
...but I won't forgive your
using unfair tactics!

12:18.427 --> 12:21.828
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

12:22.265 --> 12:23.323
Enough of that!

12:23.366 --> 12:25.834
DOUBLE TIREN!

12:29.338 --> 12:31.898
Uranus, hurry!
Take Neptune and run!

12:32.642 --> 12:33.802
Stay out of this!

12:35.344 --> 12:37.403
Y-You idiot! Hurry and run!

12:40.182 --> 12:41.706
Uranus!

12:42.418 --> 12:44.909
I'll defeat them!
Get out of my way!

12:44.954 --> 12:48.185
I don't want to! You should
be the one running away!

12:50.793 --> 12:54.024
Those two aren't doing
anything together!

12:54.063 --> 12:55.792
Get them right now!

12:55.831 --> 12:58.800
CHAIN RING!

13:01.504 --> 13:02.698
Oh, no!

13:02.738 --> 13:04.535
TIREN!

13:08.878 --> 13:11.904
You don't seem to
be good friends.

13:11.947 --> 13:14.973
It's like watching a bad
attempt at a 3-legged race!

13:22.158 --> 13:26.060
You must hate a partner
who doesn't go your way.

13:26.595 --> 13:30.031
You can both die now,
hating each other.

13:36.138 --> 13:38.504
Uranus, run away for now!

13:38.574 --> 13:41.202
You need to stay alive
and complete our mission!

13:41.844 --> 13:43.209
TIREN!

13:50.019 --> 13:50.815
Neptune!

13:57.426 --> 13:58.757
NO!!!

13:58.794 --> 14:00.694
W-What?

14:00.730 --> 14:03.927
What are you doing?
The waterfall is the other way!

14:03.966 --> 14:06.230
Follow them!
Follow the two of them!

14:09.672 --> 14:11.037
TIREN!

14:28.190 --> 14:30.988
Neptune might still be alive!

14:31.026 --> 14:32.550
Aren't you worried?

14:32.595 --> 14:35.257
Are you going to abandon
your friend and run away?

14:35.297 --> 14:36.286
This isn't coming off.

14:36.332 --> 14:37.856
That hurts! Don't pull on it!

14:37.900 --> 14:39.595
Stop whining!

14:45.441 --> 14:47.068
It looks like they're gone.

14:47.109 --> 14:49.134
Come on, let's go save her!

14:49.178 --> 14:51.669
Don't you care if Neptune dies?!

14:52.181 --> 14:53.978
If we go out
like this, we'll die!

14:54.049 --> 14:57.712
You're heartless! I thought
she was your partner!

14:58.120 --> 14:59.815
You really are a cruel person!!

14:59.855 --> 15:01.220
What do you know?!

15:07.029 --> 15:09.554
Neptune and I made a promise.

15:09.598 --> 15:12.465
That if something were to
happen to either of us...

15:12.501 --> 15:15.402
...we wouldn't be caught by
our emotions to save the other.

15:17.740 --> 15:22.006
Whoever survives completes the
mission of finding the talismans.

15:22.912 --> 15:25.346
That is what the
two of us decided.

15:25.948 --> 15:30.044
What are these talismans that
you have to find so badly?

15:30.553 --> 15:32.384
I don't have to tell you!

15:32.455 --> 15:33.786
What do you mean!?

15:33.823 --> 15:37.350
People whose pure heart crystals
are stolen all suffer...

15:37.393 --> 15:39.452
...and die!

15:39.495 --> 15:42.259
How can you be
so cold like that!?

15:43.432 --> 15:45.229
Why?!

15:45.267 --> 15:46.757
You're naive.

15:47.670 --> 15:50.434
Right now, silence is
approaching the world.

15:50.473 --> 15:52.964
Soon, something horrible
will happen.

15:53.042 --> 15:55.806
To save the world from that,
we need the talismans.

15:57.379 --> 15:59.870
Nobody wants any victims.

15:59.915 --> 16:03.316
However, if that saves
the rest of the world...

16:04.320 --> 16:06.481
What would you do?!

16:21.604 --> 16:26.405
Neptune... Is she dead?
Where are you?

16:31.146 --> 16:32.306
Oh, sorry...

16:32.348 --> 16:34.475
You're bleeding!
It's a deep wound!

16:34.517 --> 16:36.417
I'm sorry I didn't notice!

16:36.452 --> 16:37.942
I'm all right!

16:38.020 --> 16:40.011
It's all right.
Really, it is.

16:44.159 --> 16:45.626
Don't touch me!

16:45.661 --> 16:47.856
It would be a mess
if it got infected.

16:47.897 --> 16:49.159
Mind your own business!

16:49.231 --> 16:50.425
It's all right, really!

16:50.466 --> 16:52.366
You don't need to be
so humble about it.

16:53.602 --> 16:55.502
Why?

16:55.571 --> 16:58.472
I can't stand to leave
someone injured...

16:58.541 --> 17:00.509
...without doing anything.

17:00.543 --> 17:02.511
You are such a...

17:02.545 --> 17:06.106
By the way...
I have a favor to ask you.

17:06.148 --> 17:07.342
What is it?

17:07.383 --> 17:10.216
You might think it's not
proper at a time like this...

17:10.252 --> 17:12.277
...but my back's been
really itchy for a while...

17:12.321 --> 17:13.549
...and I can't
stand it anymore!

17:13.589 --> 17:15.887
I'm sorry, but can you
scratch it for me?

17:17.793 --> 17:19.590
A little further left...

17:19.628 --> 17:22.028
Yeah, there, there!
Oh, that feels good!

17:23.198 --> 17:25.063
You're a strange person.

17:26.635 --> 17:28.159
Sailor Moon, huh...

17:28.370 --> 17:31.669
You always got in my way, and I
didn't think much of you, but...

17:31.707 --> 17:33.004
Being here with
you like this...

17:33.042 --> 17:34.976
What about being with me?

17:36.712 --> 17:38.236
They're here...

17:42.284 --> 17:45.515
This cologne I smell...
Could it be...?!

17:47.323 --> 17:48.790
TIREN!

17:52.428 --> 17:55.124
We should go
look for Neptune!

18:04.340 --> 18:06.672
They've come out! Kill them!

18:10.079 --> 18:11.444
TIREN!

18:12.615 --> 18:14.446
Here, over here, over here!

18:15.451 --> 18:18.113
Their movement!
They're nothing like...

18:18.153 --> 18:20.986
...the uncoordinated
couple they were before!

18:21.023 --> 18:23.787
CHAIN RING!

18:25.694 --> 18:27.525
Oh, those idiots!

18:28.130 --> 18:32.464
But why are they suddenly able
to act in synch with each other?

18:36.271 --> 18:38.762
She's still alive! DIE!

18:38.941 --> 18:40.670
I won't let her die!

18:40.709 --> 18:42.506
W-What!?

18:47.650 --> 18:51.108
WORLD SHAKING!

18:54.923 --> 18:57.517
TIREEEEEN!

19:22.885 --> 19:30.656
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

19:41.336 --> 19:43.463
Lovely!

19:54.516 --> 19:56.143
I'll get you for this!

19:57.586 --> 19:58.644
We did it!

19:58.821 --> 19:59.719
Yeah.

20:01.557 --> 20:03.821
I'll give you a
little bit of credit.

20:03.859 --> 20:06.760
But I won't let anyone get
in the way of our mission.

20:13.368 --> 20:14.392
Neptune!

20:14.470 --> 20:17.769
Uranus... Why did you
risk your life to save me?

20:19.808 --> 20:22.436
She was the one
who rescued you.

20:26.215 --> 20:28.240
Sailor Moon did?!

20:31.240 --> 20:35.240
