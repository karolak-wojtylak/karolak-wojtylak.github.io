WEBVTT

00:03.129 --> 00:04.892
The time for the final
showdown has arrived.

00:04.931 --> 00:06.364
We have to end it here!

00:06.399 --> 00:10.802
We're the only ones who can
stop the approaching silence!

00:10.837 --> 00:11.701
That's right...

00:11.737 --> 00:14.205
I won't hand them over!
I will protect them!

00:14.240 --> 00:17.835
Chibiusa, Hotaru, AND the world!

00:24.154 --> 00:27.487
All preparations are complete.

00:31.394 --> 00:39.324
Now if you, the Messiah of Silence,
sets the Grail onto this device...

00:39.369 --> 00:43.362
...the light of shadow will
shine upon the Tau Nebula.

00:44.975 --> 00:47.273
To guide our great master...

00:47.310 --> 00:51.747
...the energy life form from
another dimension, Pharaoh 90.

00:51.781 --> 00:54.545
We need that light.

00:55.485 --> 00:59.148
When Pharaoh 90
appears in this universe...

00:59.189 --> 01:03.888
...everything will be destroyed and
the Earth will be surrounded in silence.

01:08.365 --> 01:12.233
The age of light filled with lies will end...

01:13.170 --> 01:20.303
...and the age of shadows where true
darkness reigns supreme will begin!

01:41.731 --> 01:43.028
We have to end it here.

01:43.066 --> 01:43.964
Yes...

01:44.000 --> 01:45.991
To save Chibiusa, too.

01:46.036 --> 01:48.937
And we won't let Hotaru die, either!

01:48.972 --> 01:52.499
We are Sailor Soldiers
of love and justice!

01:54.578 --> 01:55.772
Guys!

01:58.815 --> 02:02.182
Wait for us, Chibiusa, Hotaru...

02:04.054 --> 02:06.921
MERCURY STAR POWER...

02:11.328 --> 02:14.058
MARS STAR POWER...

02:19.002 --> 02:21.869
JUPITER STAR POWER...

02:26.610 --> 02:29.374
VENUS STAR POWER...

02:34.184 --> 02:37.017
MOON COSMIC POWER...

02:40.390 --> 02:44.884
MAKE UP!!

03:00.910 --> 03:03.242
We have no time left...

03:03.280 --> 03:07.273
We have to strike before
she completely awakens.

03:11.688 --> 03:15.215
So there was no Messiah after all.

03:15.258 --> 03:18.056
We have to save the
world with our own hands.

03:18.094 --> 03:21.029
No matter what sacrifice
we have to make...

03:30.774 --> 03:33.538
I won't let anybody be sacrificed!

03:41.151 --> 03:44.279
The Grail is approaching...

03:45.055 --> 03:46.647
The Grail is!?

03:47.957 --> 03:51.620
They are foolishly bringing it to us...

03:53.196 --> 03:55.721
That's good for us.

03:57.934 --> 04:03.201
But I still cannot allow...
obstructions to... enter.

04:03.239 --> 04:06.402
Not until I am fully awakened...

04:13.083 --> 04:14.050
Mars...?

04:14.084 --> 04:15.642
What's wrong?

04:15.685 --> 04:16.879
Just now...

04:16.920 --> 04:20.754
I felt a presence so
silent that it was eerie...

04:29.766 --> 04:30.528
What?

05:08.238 --> 05:10.866
A dark energy of immense levels!

05:11.441 --> 05:15.343
To get through that barrier,
we have to use the Sailor Teleport.

05:15.378 --> 05:18.370
All right, then let's do it.

05:44.507 --> 05:45.838
They're coming!

05:52.982 --> 05:53.914
SPARKLING...

05:53.950 --> 05:55.713
...WI DE PRESSURE!

05:55.752 --> 05:56.741
CRESCENT...

05:56.786 --> 05:58.083
...BEAM!

05:59.789 --> 06:01.518
BURNING...

06:01.558 --> 06:03.389
...MANDALA!

06:06.529 --> 06:08.258
Just how many are there!?

06:08.898 --> 06:10.763
This is endless!

06:10.967 --> 06:13.765
At this rate, we can't
use the Sailor Teleport!

06:14.404 --> 06:16.269
Give us a break! Sheesh!

06:36.493 --> 06:40.486
MOON SPIRAL...

06:40.530 --> 06:43.431
...HEART...

06:43.466 --> 06:45.866
...ATTACK!

06:49.606 --> 06:52.200
LOVELY!!

07:00.517 --> 07:01.643
It's no good...

07:02.018 --> 07:04.646
What in the world can we do...?

07:11.494 --> 07:12.927
Amazing!

07:14.430 --> 07:19.834
Mugen Academy is now an
omega-zone protected by dark energy...

07:19.869 --> 07:24.272
Now, no one will be able to
step inside this sacred ground.

07:26.142 --> 07:27.734
Now...

07:27.777 --> 07:29.768
The Grail...

07:33.416 --> 07:35.782
FIRE SOUL!

07:35.818 --> 07:38.013
BUBBLE SPRAY!

07:40.356 --> 07:41.288
Oh, no!

07:41.324 --> 07:43.121
MOON SPIRAL...

07:43.159 --> 07:44.456
...HEART...

07:44.494 --> 07:46.894
...ATTACK!

07:47.764 --> 07:49.561
Now's the time to teleport!

08:06.382 --> 08:07.178
Sailor Moon!

08:08.451 --> 08:09.247
Stop it!

08:09.285 --> 08:10.411
Hang on!

08:27.704 --> 08:28.932
She's gone...

08:29.505 --> 08:31.496
Sailor Moon...

08:58.334 --> 09:00.461
Can this be really happening...?

09:00.503 --> 09:06.169
If Sailor Moon has been captured,
we can't use the Sailor Teleport...

09:06.209 --> 09:09.269
Then, what should we do...?

09:13.282 --> 09:15.273
What is that...?

09:16.753 --> 09:19.449
It looks like it's no ordinary barrier.

09:20.256 --> 09:23.453
Can we enter through that hole?

09:38.541 --> 09:39.405
Dammit!

10:24.420 --> 10:26.388
This is...?

10:28.691 --> 10:30.386
Pluto...

10:31.427 --> 10:32.621
What did you do...?

10:33.830 --> 10:35.889
I have stopped time.

10:36.132 --> 10:39.260
Now, please go now.

10:39.302 --> 10:43.170
You had hidden this
much power even from us...?

10:43.206 --> 10:44.173
No...

10:44.207 --> 10:49.907
This is the greatest taboo that I
cannot break as the guardian of time...

10:50.446 --> 10:52.607
The greatest taboo...?

10:52.648 --> 10:54.775
What will happen to you?

10:56.119 --> 11:00.283
If you are able to
meet the real Messiah...

11:01.958 --> 11:04.119
If we are...?

11:04.160 --> 11:06.094
Pluto...!

11:25.715 --> 11:28.707
To enter by stopping time...

11:29.085 --> 11:32.054
Nothing less from the soldiers of
the outer rim of the solar system...

11:32.088 --> 11:38.459
But more than that, your power is
sincerely grand, oh Messiah of Silence.

11:38.494 --> 11:43.932
This is all thanks to taking in the pure
heart of that sacrifice named Chibiusa.

11:44.534 --> 11:47.332
Don't use that pure heart...

11:47.370 --> 11:50.203
...for bad things...

11:53.142 --> 11:54.837
Is something the matter?

11:55.278 --> 11:56.336
Nothing is wrong!!

12:10.026 --> 12:13.621
I will get a hold of the Grail now...

12:13.663 --> 12:17.155
I want you to get rid of the Sailor
Soldiers that have gotten in here.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.895
Me?

12:19.635 --> 12:23.298
Use the dolls that you created...

12:23.339 --> 12:26.399
Go, Daimohn Germatoid.

12:28.110 --> 12:29.407
Yes...

12:34.750 --> 12:37.844
That wall is continuing
its increase in energy.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.412
To think we can't go in...

12:40.456 --> 12:41.923
Sailor Moon...

12:42.358 --> 12:44.588
All the four of us can do...

12:44.627 --> 12:47.255
...is merely prevent that
wall from getting any bigger.

12:48.197 --> 12:51.860
We need to believe
in Sailor Moon... and...

12:51.901 --> 12:54.870
...and do what ever we can do!

12:54.904 --> 12:56.269
Yeah!

13:44.987 --> 13:46.579
Sailor Moon...

13:57.199 --> 13:58.598
Where is everyone...?

14:06.175 --> 14:08.109
Hotaru...!

14:15.818 --> 14:16.614
What's this...!?

14:19.956 --> 14:21.253
This is...

14:21.290 --> 14:24.691
These are... bodies that I have created...

14:27.296 --> 14:31.630
Both of you... it's against
school rules to come in here.

14:31.968 --> 14:37.634
Go forth for your own justice...
these are your words, chairman.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.273
It's a shame.

14:39.308 --> 14:45.679
I wanted superior students like you
to become bodies for Daimohns...

14:45.715 --> 14:49.173
Just like this man, Soichi Tomoe...

15:06.602 --> 15:09.332
So he was possessed by a Daimohn!!

15:12.274 --> 15:14.469
WORLD...

15:14.510 --> 15:16.842
...SHAKING!

15:38.401 --> 15:39.390
It's no use.

15:39.435 --> 15:42.199
I've already analyzed all your attacks.

15:42.238 --> 15:45.366
You can't win against me.

15:50.513 --> 15:52.879
DEEP...

15:52.915 --> 15:54.439
...SUBMERGE!

16:35.424 --> 16:36.789
TALISMAN!

16:43.065 --> 16:45.397
W-What!?

17:00.916 --> 17:02.406
W-What's going on!?

17:22.638 --> 17:24.333
Uranus!

17:48.564 --> 17:50.930
I thought I heard Pluto's voice...

17:50.966 --> 17:52.866
Yeah...

17:55.404 --> 17:59.135
The Death Busters are
tougher than we thought...

17:59.175 --> 18:02.008
But we won't lose...

18:09.985 --> 18:12.146
Hotaru...

18:14.757 --> 18:16.088
T-The Grail...

18:16.125 --> 18:18.958
Grail? What about the Grail?

18:18.994 --> 18:21.827
I overheard...

18:21.864 --> 18:26.233
...that if Super Sailor Moon let
the Grail shine in this room...

18:26.268 --> 18:29.396
...all enemies would be obliterated...

18:32.007 --> 18:34.737
If you don't hurry,
the enemy will be here...

18:42.151 --> 18:44.517
I'm glad you're all right, Hotaru...

18:45.154 --> 18:47.247
Y-Yes...

18:49.558 --> 18:51.492
Now, please hurry, Usagi.

18:51.527 --> 18:55.429
Hurry and use the Grail
for Chibiusa's sake as well...

18:59.468 --> 19:01.197
Hotaru...

19:01.237 --> 19:04.934
How do you know
that I'm Usagi Tsukino?

19:08.644 --> 19:11.704
You're... not Hotaru.

19:12.915 --> 19:14.542
I'm Hotaru...

19:14.583 --> 19:16.710
But, just in body.

19:18.988 --> 19:22.014
What happened to Hotaru!?

19:22.625 --> 19:24.650
I took her inside my body.

19:26.929 --> 19:29.693
I am a life form
from another dimension.

19:29.732 --> 19:34.999
I came here from the Tau Nebula
and took over Hotaru Tomoe's body.

19:35.037 --> 19:37.665
I am Mistress Nine.

19:40.943 --> 19:42.672
We've finally found you!!

19:44.346 --> 19:48.112
For the future of this planet,
we will defeat you!

19:48.684 --> 19:51.619
Wait! Uranus! Neptune!!

20:09.605 --> 20:11.368
Master Pharaoh 90...

20:11.407 --> 20:13.204
Please wait just a while longer.

20:16.204 --> 20:20.204
