WEBVTT

00:02.215 --> 00:05.013
Dobon, mahjong, and roll-of-the-dice.

00:05.052 --> 00:09.216
Games are all fun,
but you shouldn't gamble!

00:09.256 --> 00:13.352
Furthermore, to bet
people's lives is immoral!

00:13.393 --> 00:17.591
If you're an ill-willed person
who wants to win by cheating...

00:17.798 --> 00:20.528
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

00:24.000 --> 00:24.864
This one...

00:29.105 --> 00:31.699
I did it! I'm out!

00:31.741 --> 00:34.869
It seems that the joker likes me.

00:34.911 --> 00:38.005
The ace of hearts always
runs away from me...

00:41.084 --> 00:42.813
Sheesh, Hotaru!

00:42.852 --> 00:46.015
You're really good when it comes
to Memory! Don't say that!

00:46.055 --> 00:48.285
All right!
We'll play Memory!

00:48.324 --> 00:50.884
I won't lose this time!!

01:02.972 --> 01:08.501
Finally, a Daimohn who's strong during
matches that really count will be born...

01:10.513 --> 01:14.506
Oh, Professor?
It's almost time for tea!

01:14.684 --> 01:15.616
Oh, that's right!

01:15.652 --> 01:18.450
I'm in charge of getting
the snacks today, aren't I?

01:18.488 --> 01:19.284
Yes!

01:19.322 --> 01:22.382
Then, I'll go out to buy the snacks!

01:22.425 --> 01:24.950
Be careful!

01:25.862 --> 01:28.092
Sheesh, the professor is
too easy on things!

01:28.131 --> 01:31.157
If you want to make it stronger, you have
to really get down and do it like this!

01:32.035 --> 01:34.936
When it fails, I'm always the one
who takes responsibility for it...

01:34.971 --> 01:37.997
So I want him to at least do this much!

01:45.048 --> 01:47.710
T-This might not be so good...!?

01:47.750 --> 01:50.116
I-I don't know anything about this!!

01:53.256 --> 01:55.281
W-What...!?

02:11.274 --> 02:13.367
Are you all right, Chibiusa?

02:13.409 --> 02:14.341
Yeah...

02:14.377 --> 02:16.641
I'm glad...

02:19.048 --> 02:20.640
What's this!?

02:22.719 --> 02:25.415
What IS this!?

02:28.057 --> 02:29.046
Hotaru...

02:29.092 --> 02:31.060
Hotaru...?

02:37.900 --> 02:42.303
It looks like something really
out of the ordinary happened...

02:42.338 --> 02:42.963
I know!

02:46.342 --> 02:48.276
Everyone! Help me!

02:48.878 --> 02:51.278
Huh? What's wrong, Chibiusa?

02:51.547 --> 02:55.540
I don't know what's going on,
but Hotaru's house is in danger!

02:55.585 --> 02:57.018
What's wrong, Hotaru!?

02:58.054 --> 02:59.521
What in the world was that...?

02:59.555 --> 03:01.318
In any case, we should head over!

03:01.357 --> 03:02.255
Yeah...

03:02.825 --> 03:04.258
Hotaru?

03:04.293 --> 03:07.057
In my dresser...

03:07.096 --> 03:10.259
...there are fish swimming...

03:12.402 --> 03:14.495
Oh, no...

03:14.537 --> 03:15.799
Then, the rest of the house...?

03:35.625 --> 03:37.024
What should we do?

03:38.461 --> 03:40.361
Hotaru!

03:41.097 --> 03:44.533
I'm sure help is on the way,
so let's do our best until then!

03:46.002 --> 03:46.991
Yeah...

03:48.171 --> 03:52.198
Oh, boy, it looks like I'm a little late.

03:54.710 --> 03:57.008
To think someone would
pull a prank on me...!!

03:57.046 --> 03:58.980
Open up, you fool!

03:59.015 --> 04:02.542
I am the master of the house!

04:03.252 --> 04:08.121
I see! So that's how you
want to play it! Then, I'll...

04:08.458 --> 04:09.516
It's here!

04:09.559 --> 04:11.083
What in the world happened!?

04:11.127 --> 04:15.063
It looks like this house got connected to an
alternate dimension due to some strong force.

04:18.701 --> 04:20.430
You are...!?

04:20.837 --> 04:22.031
Can it be...?

04:22.071 --> 04:24.232
Have they realized who I really am...!?

04:24.574 --> 04:28.066
Don't worry, Hotaru's dad!

04:28.111 --> 04:30.238
We're not suspicious people!

04:30.546 --> 04:32.173
A necessity for times in need!

04:32.215 --> 04:34.240
Pretty soldiers with the Sailor emblem!

04:34.717 --> 04:37.242
If you don't know us, we'll punish you!

04:39.021 --> 04:42.047
What are you doing in
someone else's front yard!?

04:42.091 --> 04:43.251
So embarrassing!

04:43.292 --> 04:46.523
That's so cruel!
You didn't have to really hit me!!

04:46.562 --> 04:49.360
It's all your fault for doing
something you didn't need to do!

04:49.398 --> 04:50.057
What!?

04:50.099 --> 04:52.431
- I must've over estimated them.
- It's something I have to do! I can't help it!

04:52.468 --> 04:54.026
You'll rescue Hotaru...?

04:54.303 --> 04:57.295
Yes! Leave it to us!

04:57.406 --> 05:00.034
Now, let's hurry, Sailor Moon!

05:00.576 --> 05:05.809
The house will be sucked into this alternate
dimension and disappear in just one hour!

05:05.848 --> 05:09.079
Such a hard turn of events all of a sudden...!

05:13.956 --> 05:15.981
I'm hot...!

05:16.025 --> 05:18.585
Water...

05:19.795 --> 05:20.921
I'm cold!!

05:20.963 --> 05:23.989
Sheesh! What's up with all of this!!

05:26.569 --> 05:29.060
All right, I'm leaving it up to you, Jupiter!

05:29.105 --> 05:30.732
Wait a minute!

05:31.374 --> 05:33.774
What are you planning to do, Sailor Moon?

05:33.809 --> 05:35.174
What am I...?

05:35.211 --> 05:37.873
Well, Jupiter first uses
the Wide Pressure, right?

05:37.914 --> 05:41.873
Then, if that doesn't work, Mars can burn
the door down with Burning Mandala...

05:41.918 --> 05:44.887
And, what are you going to do?

05:44.921 --> 05:47.481
Me...?Just watch...

05:47.523 --> 05:48.854
Just kidding!

05:48.891 --> 05:51.985
Can I really trust all of you...?

05:52.495 --> 05:53.757
Of course!

05:53.796 --> 05:57.288
The only big fool who doesn't
understand the situation is this one girl!

05:57.333 --> 05:59.233
What did you say!?

05:59.268 --> 06:02.635
Anyway, if you try to forcefully
break open that door...

06:02.672 --> 06:05.368
...the time-space balance will be broken,
and the entire house will...

06:05.408 --> 06:07.501
- ...be sucked into the alternate dimension!
- See, did you hear that!?

06:07.543 --> 06:10.068
You always end up being embarrassed
because you don't listen to what others say!

06:10.112 --> 06:11.010
In any case!

06:12.014 --> 06:15.848
We should go inside,
and open the door from the inside.

06:15.885 --> 06:17.580
Um... and...

06:17.620 --> 06:20.054
How are we going to go inside...?

06:20.089 --> 06:23.354
Oh, come on! The only thing we
can do is the Sailor Teleport!

06:23.392 --> 06:24.825
- Oh, brother...
- All right!

06:24.860 --> 06:27.488
Then, let's go, guys!

06:27.530 --> 06:29.998
Yeah, yeah... Fine, just fine!

06:35.238 --> 06:38.036
SAILOR TELEPORT!

07:04.000 --> 07:05.194
What!?

07:08.671 --> 07:11.663
Did we make a mistake
in where we ended up!?

07:11.707 --> 07:12.537
No!

07:12.575 --> 07:15.703
This is inside Hotaru's house!

07:16.312 --> 07:21.306
How ironic that I have to
rely on the Sailor Soldiers...

07:21.350 --> 07:22.681
But...

07:22.718 --> 07:26.176
I can't afford to lose Hotaru now...

07:26.656 --> 07:28.783
Oh, I had forgotten...

07:28.824 --> 07:31.952
I guess I'll have this tea while I wait.

07:33.195 --> 07:37.393
Sheesh! Why is this place Hotaru's house!?

07:37.433 --> 07:41.631
As I said, it's just that various pieces of
time and space are twisted together here!

07:41.671 --> 07:47.735
The scenery keeps changing, but we haven't
moved one bit out of Hotaru's house!

07:51.080 --> 07:55.779
So, Chibiusa and Hotaru
can't be too far away, either!

07:56.319 --> 07:58.787
I'm getting dizzy.

07:59.355 --> 08:00.822
It's been 20 minutes already...

08:00.856 --> 08:02.790
I wonder if everyone is all right...

08:03.592 --> 08:05.059
Hey.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.291
How are things...?

08:08.030 --> 08:12.399
Hotaru Tomoe seems to be
trapped in an alternate dimension...

08:12.435 --> 08:17.805
In the worst case, Sailor Moon and her
gang might not be able to return as well...

08:18.174 --> 08:20.540
It would be better if they
Just didn't come back.

08:20.576 --> 08:22.134
Haruka!

08:22.178 --> 08:24.203
I can't help it!

08:24.246 --> 08:27.181
Hotaru Tomoe is a dangerous existence...

08:29.652 --> 08:31.984
Everyone... hurry up and get here...

08:32.021 --> 08:33.921
Chibiusa!

08:33.956 --> 08:35.218
Are you all right...?

08:35.257 --> 08:38.988
I'm fine, I'm all right! If
I exercise just a little bit...

08:39.028 --> 08:41.292
It's safer if you didn't
move around too much!

08:41.330 --> 08:43.560
I'm fine, it's nothing...

08:46.602 --> 08:47.660
Chibiusa!

08:51.974 --> 08:53.339
Hotaru!

08:53.376 --> 08:55.810
Chibiusa!

09:19.802 --> 09:21.929
Hotaru! That's enough!
You can let go of me!

09:23.439 --> 09:25.100
No...!

09:25.141 --> 09:26.403
Hotaru!

09:27.543 --> 09:30.740
They're inside the next
dimension that we'll be entering!

09:31.180 --> 09:32.374
Really...!?

09:32.415 --> 09:33.541
No mistakes there!

09:33.582 --> 09:34.674
It's going to shift...

09:34.717 --> 09:37.618
One, two... three!

09:45.327 --> 09:46.123
There they are!

09:46.162 --> 09:47.151
Oh, no!!

09:52.401 --> 09:55.393
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

09:57.807 --> 09:58.671
Venus!

09:58.707 --> 10:00.834
Hurry! We have to pull them up!
Help me!

10:05.214 --> 10:10.982
It's impossible to use the Sailor Teleport
if we have to take both Hotaru and Chibiusa.

10:11.020 --> 10:12.647
Then, how are we...?

10:12.688 --> 10:15.179
Can you save one of us, at least...?

10:15.624 --> 10:18.593
If that's the case... please save Chibiusa!

10:18.627 --> 10:20.686
I'll stay here...!!

10:20.996 --> 10:22.463
Hotaru...!?

10:23.466 --> 10:25.229
Please don't mind me...

10:25.267 --> 10:29.363
I'm someone who should have
never been born, anyway...

10:29.405 --> 10:33.034
Please! Save Chibiusa!

10:33.843 --> 10:35.936
Hotaru.

10:36.378 --> 10:37.572
It's all right!

10:37.613 --> 10:40.241
We'll rescue both of you!

10:40.282 --> 10:42.443
You're Chibiusa's friend, right?

10:42.952 --> 10:46.115
If you say stuff like that,
Chibiusa will be sad!

10:46.155 --> 10:50.387
I'm sure this young lady here will
find a way for all of us to go back!

10:50.426 --> 10:54.453
Chibiusa's friend is our friend...

10:54.797 --> 10:58.130
Let's all go back together.

10:58.934 --> 11:00.196
Okay...

11:00.236 --> 11:03.694
Sheesh...
They only have 30 minutes left...

11:04.373 --> 11:05.567
We'll be connected to the exit!

11:17.019 --> 11:18.543
Everyone... are you all right!?

11:18.587 --> 11:20.316
Yeah...

11:20.356 --> 11:22.324
I can't take this anymore!

11:23.325 --> 11:25.293
Can we really get out of here...!?

11:25.327 --> 11:27.557
We have the highest possibility here.

11:27.596 --> 11:29.757
I have a bad feeling about this...

11:33.435 --> 11:34.925
Just as I thought.

11:35.638 --> 11:38.038
Welcome...

11:40.943 --> 11:43.241
Welcome here!

11:43.279 --> 11:51.015
I'm a strange Daimohn who lives
in this strange world, Ikasaman!

11:51.053 --> 11:54.750
The energy for this alternate
dimension is all coming from her!!

11:55.190 --> 11:59.024
That's correct...
I hope you enjoyed your epic adventure.

11:59.328 --> 12:00.955
That means...

12:00.996 --> 12:04.022
We can't get out of here
unless we defeat that thing!?

12:04.066 --> 12:05.397
Hold on a moment!

12:06.001 --> 12:07.935
I don't like violence...

12:07.970 --> 12:10.871
I'm a pacifist, though I'm a villain.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.731
What kind of villain is that!?

12:13.776 --> 12:14.868
Well, you know...

12:14.910 --> 12:17.344
I love to gamble.

12:17.379 --> 12:22.874
If you play a game with me and you win,
I'll let you go back to your own world...

12:23.152 --> 12:24.915
We don't have time for that!

12:24.954 --> 12:26.922
BURNING--

12:27.289 --> 12:28.415
Then...!

12:29.391 --> 12:32.918
I guess I'll have you go to
some strange place again!

12:33.696 --> 12:35.027
Fine!

12:35.064 --> 12:38.932
But if even one person wins,
I want you to take us back to our world!

12:39.368 --> 12:40.630
Nice!

12:40.669 --> 12:42.864
I don't care what game we play!

12:42.905 --> 12:47.433
But, if I win... I'll have you as my
gaming partners for eternity!

12:48.444 --> 12:50.969
Now, let's begin!

12:51.447 --> 12:54.746
All right! I'll go first against you!

12:55.250 --> 12:56.239
A challenge!

12:58.554 --> 13:00.181
Red... 16!

13:09.999 --> 13:12.797
- You lose!
- You're a cheater!

13:13.602 --> 13:15.001
There!

13:15.037 --> 13:17.801
Now, it's your turn, right?

13:25.547 --> 13:27.981
You lose!

13:30.853 --> 13:31.911
Checkmate!

13:31.954 --> 13:33.114
I win!

13:33.155 --> 13:35.350
Oh! That square...

13:39.628 --> 13:42.597
There! You lose!

13:43.732 --> 13:45.324
Who's up next?

13:46.135 --> 13:47.568
We are!

13:50.873 --> 13:55.173
I'll show you that it's not for nothing that
I've been going to the arcades so much!

13:57.146 --> 13:59.171
Bring it on!

14:03.252 --> 14:06.221
You have to read the
directions well first, you know!

14:06.255 --> 14:09.986
It's not always the case that
the car will move forward!

14:10.025 --> 14:11.686
That's... impossible...!!

14:12.327 --> 14:15.353
Was that all...?

14:15.397 --> 14:17.490
Hold on just a minute!

14:17.533 --> 14:19.933
We'll challenge you!

14:20.369 --> 14:22.200
Chibiusa!

14:22.905 --> 14:25.430
Okay...
What game will you like?

14:25.908 --> 14:27.933
Old Maid!

14:28.677 --> 14:30.440
Okay!

14:34.817 --> 14:35.943
A challenge!

14:37.419 --> 14:39.046
What is everyone doing...?

14:39.088 --> 14:40.953
They have less than 1 0 minutes left...!

14:41.924 --> 14:43.949
Now, it's your turn!

14:44.660 --> 14:46.685
Then, I'll take a card!

14:46.729 --> 14:48.390
Is it this one?

14:49.398 --> 14:52.629
She's a child after all...
I can tell just by looking at her face...!

14:52.868 --> 14:55.302
Or is it this one...?

14:55.738 --> 14:57.865
Justas I thought! This one!

14:58.941 --> 14:59.999
T-This is...!!

15:00.042 --> 15:02.135
Hah! You fell for it!

15:02.177 --> 15:04.270
Dammit! How dare you!?

15:08.283 --> 15:10.581
I've been waiting for you to take that!

15:10.619 --> 15:12.314
Really?

15:12.354 --> 15:14.288
Oh, I'm so glad!

15:15.224 --> 15:17.385
- If you're told that, you usually...
- Here, it's your turn, Chibiusa.

15:17.426 --> 15:19.417
- ...would think that it was a joker!
- I did it! A match!

15:19.461 --> 15:21.622
Here!

15:21.663 --> 15:23.392
I did it! I win!

15:24.566 --> 15:26.033
- You did it!
- Chibiusa!

15:26.068 --> 15:29.663
Now, you promised!
Take us back to our world!

15:29.705 --> 15:30.501
Not yet!

15:31.073 --> 15:34.770
I won't let you go until SHE wins!

15:34.810 --> 15:36.175
That can't be...

15:36.211 --> 15:38.179
If you don't like it,
I won't let you through!

15:39.047 --> 15:41.208
Well, you don't even have 5 minutes left...!

15:41.250 --> 15:42.239
Fine!

15:42.284 --> 15:46.846
Hotaru, stare at her face,
and decide which card you want to pick!

15:47.189 --> 15:50.420
One is the joker,
and the other is the ace of hearts!

15:50.459 --> 15:52.120
Ace of hearts...

15:52.427 --> 15:57.126
I must make her pick the joker
at any cost... All right!

15:58.634 --> 16:01.933
Now, even I don't know
which one the joker is!

16:01.970 --> 16:05.030
Think hard, and flip over one card...

16:07.009 --> 16:10.672
This will decide everyone's fate...

16:11.914 --> 16:13.006
During that last moment...

16:13.048 --> 16:16.575
...I put a small mark on the joker so
I would know which is which!

16:16.618 --> 16:18.848
I can work on her for a bit...

16:18.887 --> 16:23.324
...and since she's such an honest girl,
she'll pick the card that I want her to pick!

16:25.727 --> 16:29.754
Oh? Do you really want to pick that card?

16:34.002 --> 16:38.166
That's right, I think that's the better choice!

16:38.707 --> 16:40.140
Hotaru!

16:40.509 --> 16:41.771
It doesn't matter which!

16:41.810 --> 16:43.937
Pick the one that you like!

16:43.979 --> 16:46.846
Don't worry about which one!
Just let yourself go and pick one!

16:46.882 --> 16:48.179
You'll do all right!

16:48.217 --> 16:51.152
We all believe in you!

16:52.054 --> 16:53.351
Why...?

16:53.388 --> 16:56.323
Because we all like you so much!

16:59.628 --> 17:03.064
Hotaru!
Just think of this as a game of Memory!

17:13.108 --> 17:15.076
You did it, Hotaru!

17:15.110 --> 17:17.635
Chibiusa...

17:18.347 --> 17:19.439
Hotaru!

17:19.681 --> 17:22.206
It's all right, she just passed out.

17:22.251 --> 17:23.445
Now, you promised!

17:23.852 --> 17:26.320
Take us back!

17:26.722 --> 17:28.690
I forgot whether or not
I ever made that promise!

17:28.724 --> 17:29.884
What did you say!?

17:29.925 --> 17:31.552
You're so unfair!

17:31.593 --> 17:34.528
Say what ever you like!

17:38.533 --> 17:40.763
I can't forgive you any longer!

17:41.737 --> 17:43.728
MOON PRISM POWER...

17:43.772 --> 17:46.172
MAKE UP!

17:51.013 --> 17:53.311
PINK SUGAR...

17:53.348 --> 17:55.509
...HEART...

17:55.550 --> 17:56.778
...ATTACK!

18:01.790 --> 18:03.155
That's funny...

18:03.191 --> 18:05.887
I really had my heart set on it today...

18:10.165 --> 18:12.133
That was dangerous!

18:12.167 --> 18:13.725
But... you were able to get out!

18:13.769 --> 18:15.396
Oh, you're right!

18:16.605 --> 18:18.402
CRISIS...

18:18.440 --> 18:20.840
MAKE UP!

18:48.637 --> 18:52.471
RAINBOW...

18:52.507 --> 18:53.872
...MOON...

18:53.909 --> 18:57.072
...HEART ACHE!

19:01.984 --> 19:05.511
I'm against violence!

19:09.358 --> 19:11.986
Love-lovely!!

19:26.174 --> 19:26.868
We're back!

19:26.908 --> 19:29.206
You did it, Sailor Moon!

19:31.980 --> 19:33.038
Hotaru!

19:33.081 --> 19:34.844
Wait a minute!

19:35.384 --> 19:38.080
It would be bad to stay in that outfit!

19:38.120 --> 19:41.055
Oh, I get it...

19:41.723 --> 19:44.715
Hotaru... Thank you!

19:50.932 --> 19:52.058
Hotaru...!

19:52.100 --> 19:53.226
Thank you...

19:53.268 --> 19:55.099
I don't know how I can thank you...!

19:59.574 --> 20:07.106
Someday, you'll regret that you
ever saved her, Sailor Soldiers...

20:07.983 --> 20:10.247
It was too bad, Haruka.

20:10.285 --> 20:16.554
Setsuna, Haruka believes in
Sailor Moon more than either of us.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.219
Who ever said that?

20:20.562 --> 20:23.292
We did it, Chibiusa, Hotaru!

20:23.331 --> 20:24.662
Yeah...!

20:24.699 --> 20:28.897
We really are the ultimate duo, Hotaru!

20:31.897 --> 20:35.897
