00:03.116 --> 00:05.641
What in the world are you?

00:05.686 --> 00:08.120
Are you enemies? Or allies?

00:08.155 --> 00:11.283
If you are soldiers as well,
fight with us!

00:11.858 --> 00:15.726
I can't forgive those that
stomp on pure hearts!

00:15.762 --> 00:20.426
I, Sailor Moon, will punish
you with a new attack!

00:27.868 --> 00:29.335
Kaorinite...

00:31.271 --> 00:32.670
Yes, Professor.

00:33.140 --> 00:36.940
What is the purpose of
our group, Death Busters?

00:36.977 --> 00:40.572
To acquire the holy grail
and control the world.

00:42.816 --> 00:46.582
And how are we going to
get the holy grail?

00:47.020 --> 00:52.117
If we find the three talismans that are
within the pure hearts of the chosen ones...

00:52.159 --> 00:54.593
...we will know the whereabouts
of the holy grail.

00:55.128 --> 00:59.462
That is right. For that, we must
first use the Daimohn eggs to...

01:24.758 --> 01:28.819
Now, find the pure heart
that is just right for you!

02:11.171 --> 02:13.002
Why!?

02:16.743 --> 02:20.110
The light from the Silver
Crystal is disappearing...

02:20.280 --> 02:22.407
Oh, my, tired from studying?

02:22.449 --> 02:24.041
Or did you work too hard?

02:24.084 --> 02:26.279
Or you didn't get your afternoon nap?

02:26.319 --> 02:30.449
Usagi, shouldn't you retire soon?

02:30.891 --> 02:34.418
You... all of you are traitors!

02:35.729 --> 02:38.630
- I won't forgive you!
- I-I can't breathe!

02:38.665 --> 02:41.133
You... you... you... you...

02:44.337 --> 02:45.668
A dream...?

02:45.705 --> 02:48.640
Really, Usagi...

02:51.645 --> 02:53.306
It's not a dream...

02:53.346 --> 02:57.442
If the light doesn't come back, I might
not be able to transform again...

02:57.484 --> 02:58.917
Usagi...

02:58.952 --> 03:03.719
Luna... Does it mean I have to
retire from being a Sailor Soldier?

03:03.757 --> 03:05.384
That's not true...

03:05.725 --> 03:08.558
But the Silver Crystal...

03:08.595 --> 03:12.156
I-It'll be all right!
I'm sure everything will be all right!

03:12.799 --> 03:14.767
Cheer up, Usagi!

03:14.801 --> 03:16.462
Oh, that's right!

03:16.503 --> 03:19.995
Why don't you talk
this out with Mamoru?

03:20.040 --> 03:21.098
But...

03:21.141 --> 03:23.041
Now, cheer up! Come on now!

03:28.582 --> 03:30.777
You had a dream like that?

03:31.685 --> 03:33.175
Mamo-chan...

03:33.220 --> 03:35.780
I wonder what's going
to happen to me now...

03:36.423 --> 03:41.417
If I can't transform,
I can't fight against the new enemy...

03:48.301 --> 03:51.134
I know! I'll show you
something good, Usako.

03:53.073 --> 03:55.064
Just come with me...

04:09.656 --> 04:12.124
It's okay, come on!

04:12.926 --> 04:15.622
I-Is it all right to go
into a place like this?

04:16.329 --> 04:19.127
I don't think it's all right, but...

04:20.900 --> 04:23.130
Nobody's around...

04:23.169 --> 04:26.138
Oh, Mamo-chan!

04:26.172 --> 04:28.504
Just because you wanted
to be alone with me...

04:28.541 --> 04:31.635
You didn't have to bring
me to a place like this!

04:32.445 --> 04:34.538
Don't jump to conclusions!

04:34.581 --> 04:38.176
It's all right! Come on! You don't
have to be shy about it! Okay!

04:43.423 --> 04:45.015
My, how cute!

04:45.058 --> 04:47.652
Let me hold it!

04:47.694 --> 04:50.629
Good girl. Because you're brown...

04:50.664 --> 04:52.962
Your name is Char-chan!

04:53.166 --> 04:54.190
There, there.

04:54.234 --> 04:57.226
Mamo-chan, you wanted
to show me this kitten?

04:57.270 --> 05:00.205
Yeah. This is where stray cats live.

05:02.742 --> 05:04.710
Where are you going, Char-chan?

05:05.679 --> 05:07.203
You too, Mamo-chan! Hurry!

05:07.247 --> 05:09.215
H-Hey...! Sheesh.

05:09.849 --> 05:12.215
Now, eat up!

05:15.622 --> 05:19.217
Don't rush...
There is still plenty left.

05:19.559 --> 05:22.221
Are you taking care of those cats?

05:22.862 --> 05:24.489
Who is it?

05:26.800 --> 05:28.995
Defenders of justice!

05:29.035 --> 05:30.866
Nice to meet you!

05:37.143 --> 05:40.840
Let me join you!
Doyou always feed the cats?

05:40.880 --> 05:44.179
Yeah, but I feel sorry for them...

05:44.217 --> 05:48.677
I finally found this place, but
it's going to be demolished soon...

05:48.955 --> 05:52.254
They all want to be happy, but...

05:52.292 --> 05:54.123
You're kind...

05:54.160 --> 05:55.559
All right!

05:55.595 --> 05:58.462
I'll take care of the cats too!

05:58.498 --> 06:00.159
Is that all right, Mamo-chan?

06:00.900 --> 06:03.164
Well, I guess it's all right
if it'll cheer you up.

06:38.838 --> 06:40.305
Taking care of cats!?

06:40.340 --> 06:44.208
Not just taking care of them!
I have to find the cats' new owners!

06:44.677 --> 06:48.943
Rei, Ami, Minako, Mako-chan...

06:49.449 --> 06:54.443
Four cats will be taken care
of when you each take one...

06:54.954 --> 06:59.618
Wait a minute. I barely get
by taking care of Artemis!

06:59.659 --> 07:01.957
What doyou mean by that?!

07:01.995 --> 07:03.462
Don't worry about it. Don't worry.

07:03.696 --> 07:05.857
Our place too...

07:06.966 --> 07:09.298
See, we have a lot of birds.

07:09.335 --> 07:11.064
I can't possibly have a cat here.

07:13.206 --> 07:14.833
Um...

07:14.874 --> 07:18.742
I'm living by myself. I don't
think I can take care of a cat.

07:19.045 --> 07:23.243
I'm facing important entrance exams...

07:23.283 --> 07:26.252
I don't think I am at ease
enough to take care of a cat...

07:26.586 --> 07:30.386
What, what's all this!?
You guys only think about yourselves!

07:30.423 --> 07:33.756
Then why can't you take care of
them all at your place, Usagi?

07:37.030 --> 07:38.156
Well, um...

07:38.198 --> 07:39.995
I have a reason why I can't!

07:40.033 --> 07:43.935
We barely get by feeding
Luna's giant stomach!

07:43.970 --> 07:47.201
Who has a giant stomach!?

07:48.107 --> 07:51.873
Anyway, don't rush. Why don't you look
for people who might take care of them?

07:52.245 --> 07:57.842
All right. Then, for now, we'll each get
some food for the cats, and meet up again.

07:57.884 --> 07:59.351
Got that!?

07:59.385 --> 08:00.852
What's going on?

08:00.887 --> 08:03.287
She's just being whimsical, as always.

08:08.194 --> 08:09.786
No, don't follow me.

08:11.498 --> 08:14.524
I'm sorry...
I can't keep any cats here...

08:17.537 --> 08:20.267
Only until Mom comes home...

08:24.043 --> 08:26.136
Keep yourselves out of trouble!

08:26.179 --> 08:28.841
Don't climb on the bed!

08:28.882 --> 08:30.008
Hey now!

08:30.049 --> 08:32.040
I'm in the middle of this...

08:32.685 --> 08:33.845
Now...

08:33.887 --> 08:35.548
Was it here?

08:43.029 --> 08:45.623
NEKONNELL!

08:47.467 --> 08:48.764
T-This is a joke, right?

08:53.239 --> 08:57.266
I will take the talisman
inside your pure heart now-NELL!

08:59.712 --> 09:01.543
Run!

09:02.015 --> 09:04.779
I won't let you get away! NELL NELL!

10:00.039 --> 10:03.839
I wonder if she's not
going to come today...

10:04.611 --> 10:06.772
There, there. Char-chan.

10:06.813 --> 10:10.249
They make me want to ask Grandpa
and see if I can keep one of them.

10:10.283 --> 10:13.878
Don't say one, take all of them!

10:14.621 --> 10:18.079
Usagi, this isn't a bargain
sale at a supermarket.

10:18.124 --> 10:19.182
Oh, sorry.

10:30.803 --> 10:32.703
W-What's wrong?

10:34.374 --> 10:36.205
What's going on?

10:43.016 --> 10:45.746
NELL NELL NELL!

11:00.667 --> 11:02.191
A Daimohn again...

11:02.769 --> 11:05.237
Just maybe... I might be able to...

11:05.705 --> 11:08.230
MOON CRYSTAL POWER...

11:08.274 --> 11:10.242
...MAKE UP!

11:12.111 --> 11:12.668
U-Usagi...

11:12.712 --> 11:13.406
Usagi...

11:18.851 --> 11:20.819
Let's go, everyone!

11:21.521 --> 11:24.217
MARS STAR POWER...

11:24.257 --> 11:26.782
...MAKE UP!

11:27.493 --> 11:30.087
JUPITER STAR POWER...

11:30.129 --> 11:32.654
...MAKE UP!

11:33.900 --> 11:36.198
MERCURY STAR POWER...

11:36.235 --> 11:38.760
...MAKE UP!

11:39.806 --> 11:41.899
VENUS STAR POWER...

11:41.941 --> 11:44.136
...MAKE UP!

12:14.674 --> 12:17.973
This time, I will
take the talisman, NELL!

12:18.010 --> 12:19.637
We won't let you do that!

12:23.316 --> 12:25.648
The Sailor Soldiers are here!

12:26.052 --> 12:27.041
What?

12:27.887 --> 12:31.789
BURNING...

12:34.594 --> 12:37.119
...MANDALA!

12:37.830 --> 12:39.127
SPARKLING...

12:39.165 --> 12:41.395
...WIDE PRESSURE!

12:51.344 --> 12:52.777
T-They're all...

12:52.812 --> 12:53.744
Stop!

12:53.780 --> 12:54.337
Wait!

12:54.380 --> 12:56.109
Usagi!

13:02.789 --> 13:04.620
Nobody else will get
in the way now! NELL!

13:07.493 --> 13:09.859
NELL NELL NELL!

13:22.475 --> 13:26.434
Now I have a souvenir to bring
to lady Kaorinite! NELL!

13:29.348 --> 13:30.940
What is it? NELLLLLLLLL!

13:41.828 --> 13:43.955
Such a powerless being.

13:45.164 --> 13:46.995
It's those two again!

13:52.305 --> 13:53.363
How is it?

13:53.406 --> 13:54.998
This is not a talisman...

14:03.850 --> 14:06.512
Who in the world... are they?

14:19.498 --> 14:21.090
Wait!

14:22.335 --> 14:24.428
We haven't defeated the enemy yet!

14:24.470 --> 14:25.869
If you are soldiers as well...

14:25.905 --> 14:28.100
...fight with us!

14:28.140 --> 14:29.664
Don't get the wrong idea!

14:29.709 --> 14:32.576
Our mission is only
to acquire the talismans...

14:32.612 --> 14:35.080
There's no way we can fight with you!

14:35.114 --> 14:39.676
You should settle your
own affairs by yourselves.

14:45.191 --> 14:46.590
What!?

14:55.668 --> 14:57.363
Everyone!

15:07.480 --> 15:08.811
Who the NELL is it?

15:10.449 --> 15:12.883
Tuxedo Mask!

15:14.287 --> 15:19.589
Those who toy with pure hearts will
someday be tried by pure hearts!

15:22.495 --> 15:24.622
NEKONNELL!

15:39.779 --> 15:40.575
What...!?

15:49.922 --> 15:51.947
Tuxedo Mask!

15:51.991 --> 15:54.118
Run, Usako!

15:58.864 --> 16:03.164
Now! Usako, at least you
should get away from here!

16:03.202 --> 16:06.000
I can't do that!

16:06.439 --> 16:07.667
Hurry and run!

16:07.707 --> 16:08.537
No...

16:08.574 --> 16:11.202
I want to protect everyone...!

16:11.243 --> 16:13.268
And my dear Mamo-chan too...

16:13.579 --> 16:16.275
I will fight with everyone...

16:16.882 --> 16:18.281
Usako...

16:18.818 --> 16:20.786
Usagi...

16:36.635 --> 16:38.865
T-That's...

17:15.474 --> 17:18.705
This, born from our
combined power, is...?

17:19.845 --> 17:21.745
The legendary rod...

17:21.781 --> 17:24.716
Spiral Heart Moon Rod...

17:26.285 --> 17:30.312
The legendary Spiral Heart Moon Rod?

17:30.356 --> 17:33.189
NEKONNELL!

17:37.063 --> 17:39.554
Usagi! Transform!

17:39.598 --> 17:41.395
I'm sure you can do it now!!

17:46.338 --> 17:50.001
MOON COSMIC POWER...

17:50.042 --> 17:52.476
...MAKE UP!!

18:23.342 --> 18:27.335
I won't forgive you for
trampling pure hearts underfoot!

18:28.214 --> 18:29.238
For love and justice...

18:29.281 --> 18:31.613
...the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

18:31.650 --> 18:33.345
Sailor Moon!

18:34.854 --> 18:38.620
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

19:01.113 --> 19:04.708
MOON SPIRAL...

19:05.384 --> 19:08.478
...HEART...

19:08.521 --> 19:10.682
...ATTACK!

19:17.196 --> 19:19.858
Lovely!

19:32.444 --> 19:33.968
I did it!

19:34.013 --> 19:35.844
I was able to transform!

19:35.881 --> 19:38.179
That was splendid, Sailor Moon...

19:40.686 --> 19:43.382
This is our...

19:51.530 --> 19:53.430
I'm glad, so glad.

19:54.066 --> 19:55.931
But it's going to be tough from now on.

19:56.335 --> 20:00.203
Yeah. We're going to
find owners for the cats.

20:01.106 --> 20:02.437
I already found them.

20:03.475 --> 20:04.840
5 cats go to Rei...

20:04.877 --> 20:08.938
Two to Ami, two more to Minako,
and one to Mako-chan!

20:08.981 --> 20:12.644
I've been saying that
you can't do that!

20:15.754 --> 20:18.450
I'm not a cat!

20:20.826 --> 20:23.454
We can have them taken care
of at the Animal Kingdom!

20:23.996 --> 20:27.830
Why didn't you think of that earlier?

20:29.368 --> 20:32.462
This is no good...

20:35.462 --> 20:39.462
