1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,991
The moon whispers in the breeze.

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:06,333
A waltz drifts in the air
of the mansion of roses.

3
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:11,104
And a song of hope for the future,
sung in a high voice by a Daimohn...

4
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:12,905
Hey, wait a minute!

5
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:15,105
That's not a waltz at all!

6
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:17,376
You're just singing a strange yodel!

7
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:20,213
The rhythm of a waltz
is un-deux-trois!

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,320
An afternoon in the late summer heat.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,130
In your nicely air-conditioned room...

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,500
...the happiness as I
have a romantic daydream.

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,430
USAGI!!

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,410
It's no time to be daydreaming!

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,470
Sheesh, Usagi. You're so...

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,140
You have to keep yourself together.

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,550
You said you wanted me to tutor you...

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,710
Let me guess, the air conditioning
was what you were after?

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,840
No, not at all...

18
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,150
The herb tea is delicious too... Oh...

19
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,050
Thanks for the compliments...

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,120
Ami, what are you doing?

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,460
Did you find an interesting book?

22
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,990
Yes... all academic books
of very high caliber.

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,300
Basic Dictionary of
Ancient Babylonian Language.

24
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,730
Fluid Mechanics and Wave Mechanics.

25
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,430
Computer Programming Languages
and Symbolic Logic.

26
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,310
You Can Make Your Own Curry
Dishes from Around the World.

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,570
But, these subjects
don't seem very consistent...

28
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,140
All of them are really interesting.

29
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,580
I just can't bring myself to
specifying any one field as my major.

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,550
Wow, that's amazing!

31
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,580
Wouldn't you say that you're a jack of
all trades but a master of none?

32
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,580
Just for reference...
That's not really a compliment.

33
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,160
You guys really DO need
to study some more.

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,360
Well, we'll start
with the English readers.

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,120
I'm terrible at English!

36
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,470
In your case, Usako... you're
terrible at English AS WELL, right?

37
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,700
Hey, someone's here!
Coming, coming!

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,240
U-Uh... We're fine if
you're selling newspapers...

39
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,620
I AM... ...English...

40
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,250
...NO, NO, CAN'T... ...see?

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,830
Young lady, is Mamoru around?

42
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,100
M-Mamoru... ...IS...
...here, that he is...

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,750
Oh, man!
You can speak Japanese!

44
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,610
Edwards!

45
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,580
Hello, Mamoru. Long time no see.

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,610
Hello, young ladies.

47
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,460
Mako-chan, I don't
think that's quite it...

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,360
I was afraid of that.

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,530
If you'd like,
you can have some tea...

50
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,930
No, don't mind me.

51
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,960
Actually, a group of youngsters are
coming over to my place again today.

52
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,870
They told me to invite
you to the gathering.

53
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,140
Thanks for coming all
the way out here...

54
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,580
Oh, I just came here as
part of my daily walk.

55
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,070
Oh, yes, if they would like to come,
the young ladies are also invited.

56
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,670
It's a very fun party.

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,780
Party!!?

58
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,250
Edwards is an English
gentleman who lives...

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,290
...in the European mansion
on the outskirts of town.

60
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,800
So he's the much-rumored English gentleman
who lives in that European mansion!

61
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:18,930
Yeah.

62
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,240
Edwards often invites
young exchange students...

63
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,540
...to his mansion,
and holds parties for them.

64
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,180
The mansion on top of the hill...
The graceful melodies of a waltz...

65
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,110
It's wonderful that you
can communicate between...

66
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,050
...cultures with people
from various countries.

67
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,350
In a wonderful European mansion...
a party with Mamo-chan!

68
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,820
Starting today,
I too am a global person!

69
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,160
But... the fact that it's
a party for exchange students...

70
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,660
Yeah. Most of the
conversation is in English.

71
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,820
ENGLISH
Yeah. Most of the
conversation is in English.

72
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,100
So, in order for you not
to be embarrassed at the party...

73
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,160
...let's brush up your English skills.

74
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,370
Party with Mamo-chan...

75
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,100
ENGLISH
But in English.

76
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,100
T-That's why we're going to
go over English now, right?

77
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,070
Party with Mamo-chan...

78
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,100
ENGLISH
But in English.

79
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,110
Hello? Usako?

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,640
I guess we're calling it a day now...

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,880
We couldn't study at all again today...

82
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,280
The elegant melody of the waltz.

83
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,290
The three-beat rhythm represents...

84
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,850
...intelligence, education,
and the will to fight.

85
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,390
It is the ultimate music that
represents us, the Death Busters.

86
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,460
Excuse me a moment...

87
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,110
The song title is
""Hope for the Future.""

88
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,470
It's a piece I composed
when I was young.

89
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,870
In other words...

90
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,170
This time, we're
targeting someone with...

91
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,480
...a pure heart that fits
the images of a waltz well.

92
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,980
Yes... and the "Hope
for the Future" as well.

93
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,410
Yes...

94
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,720
An owner of a pure heart
who loves a waltz...

95
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,990
...and is passionate about
hope for the future.

96
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,520
Gloria!

97
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,360
I-I didn't know that
this was a waltz at all...

98
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,000
P-Professor!?

99
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,140
Professor!?

100
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,000
Professor!?

101
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,970
Sheesh, what part of that was a waltz!?

102
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,740
Boy, I have a bad feeling about this...

103
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,570
Chiquon!

104
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,130
You're kidding!

105
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,140
W-What was that!?

106
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,350
Wow, lots of handsome guys!

107
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,150
Lots of tall people!

108
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,050
They really ARE talking in English!!

109
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,420
Usagi, love has no boundaries!!

110
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,720
The one who talks wins!

111
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,590
You say that, but...

112
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,660
Usagi, this is a chance to
really use English! Try your best!

113
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,160
I haven't studied enough to
think that this is a chance!

114
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,600
L-LONG TIE...

115
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,010
T-They're coming!!

116
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,990
Mamoru, please hurry up and introduce
us to these lovely young ladies.

117
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,680
They are... very good at Japanese.

118
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,920
We do attend a Japanese university.

119
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,830
We lucked out, Usagi.

120
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,160
Where's Usagi?

121
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,860
Maybe in the bathroom?

122
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,030
H-HOW... ARE... YOU...

123
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,500
NICE...? NICE TO...?

124
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,200
MEAT... No, not that...

125
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,940
...MEET YOU...

126
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,370
Everyone is so amazing!

127
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,350
Even Rei and Mako-chan
are speaking in English...

128
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,710
Well, for now, I'll drink
some juice and calm down.

129
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,290
Mamoru, you should pursue theoretical
physics. It's a wonderful field.

130
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,420
George, you shouldn't force
your likes on others...

131
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,950
What are you studying, Ned?

132
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,760
They all study very
advanced subjects...

133
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,360
They are reliable young individuals.

134
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,970
It's my pleasure to provide this mansion
as a place for them to socialize.

135
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,800
A beautiful waltz, and young individuals
who are full of possibilities.

136
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,180
Life is rosy when you have those
two things. That is what I believe.

137
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,580
That's amazing...

138
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,990
I think I can see that rosy future.

139
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,280
I want you to become one of those
people who create that rosy future.

140
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,490
Yes, I will do my best.

141
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,620
All too amazing.

142
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,690
The conversation level is
so high, I can't keep up.

143
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,320
Ami really IS a genius.

144
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,600
Hey, Mamo-chan!

145
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,500
Usagi?

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,670
The pudding of relativity?
Let's see...

147
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,640
Well, in other words, you take eggs,
milk, and sugar, and you stir it all up.

148
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,140
Then you put a lid on it, and for
about 30 minutes you steam it...

149
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,670
Oh! If you forget the whipped cream,
you're no good as a woman. Yeah.

150
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,350
Interesting... to make a metaphor out of
the theory of relativity and pudding...

151
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,690
That's a pretty unique perspective.

152
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,320
Oh, mister, you're speaking Japanese!

153
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,850
You're such an Edo kid!
Have some sushi, yeah!

154
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,060
U-Usako?

155
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,930
Now, Mamo-chan, you too.
About international socialization...

156
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,370
Make it flamboyant!

157
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,970
Usagi, you are an individualist.

158
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,710
Well... NICE TO MEET YOU, CREAM STEW!

159
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,740
She's drunk.

160
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,370
DON'T WORRY... Big bowl, curry!

161
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,680
Lady, if you could come over here...

162
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,950
SEE YOU AGAIN!
I won't give you anything!

163
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,550
Mamoru, escort the young
lady over to the balcony...

164
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,420
Right...

165
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,620
Everyone, we have invited
two new guests tonight.

166
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,890
Please direct your
attention to the stage.

167
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,400
Miss Haruka Tenoh and
Miss Michiru Kaioh.

168
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,500
Haruka!?

169
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,830
Michiru, too!

170
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,430
Everyone, listen...

171
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,410
Usagi is...?

172
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,770
Here, have some water.

173
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,510
How did she drink booze--

174
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,850
I didn't drink booze at all...

175
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,550
I drank some juice. Like this...
Just like this...

176
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,420
- Usagi, wait a minute!
- Usagi, pull yourself together!

177
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,700
Show time.

178
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,140
Are you all right, Usagi?

179
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,980
Somehow...

180
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:07,910
Hello, girls.

181
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,680
Good evening.

182
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,700
Haruka.

183
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,810
This is a wonderful party.

184
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,410
A waltz just started.

185
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,550
Mamoru, would you care
to join me in a dance?

186
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,820
No! Mamo-chan's dancing with ME...

187
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,990
Oh, my... then buns-head
can dance with me.

188
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes, gladly!

189
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,760
That's it... You're pretty good.

190
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,830
Yes... it's just like
I'm having a dream.

191
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,540
Usagi is...

192
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,870
...dancing.

193
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,040
It's thanks to Haruka's lead.

194
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,010
I'm jealous...
I want the next dance...

195
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,780
All right! We'll arm-wrestle
for who goes next!

196
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,380
C-Can we make that
paper-rock-scissors, at least?

197
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,680
G-Guys...

198
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,020
Ready, set...

199
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,690
The master of this mansion
apparently helps...

200
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,630
...young individuals,
and he never holds out.

201
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,160
When he was young, Edwards gained his
wealth by stomping on top of other people.

202
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,360
He'd firmly believed that money was what
you needed to build a brighter future.

203
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,130
However, he realized something one day.

204
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,970
Without family or friends,
he was all alone.

205
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,040
He wondered who he could
entrust the rosy future to...

206
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,280
Rosy future?

207
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,010
He's a romantic person, isn't he?

208
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,540
A future is something that you need
to pay a huge sacrifice to attain.

209
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,790
Even a future that you get
by paying many sacrifices...

210
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,550
...means nothing if there
is nobody to look after it.

211
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,650
It's impossible to
do that by yourself...

212
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,390
Ready, set, toss!

213
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,260
Tie, set, toss!

214
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,960
Tie, set, toss!

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,600
Tie, set, toss!

216
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,400
- Hey, Rei put her hand in a bit late!
- Hey, I haven't done such a thing!

217
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,000
- Sure you did!
- Did not!

218
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,300
Oh, tres bien!

219
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,320
Khorosho!

220
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,530
What a fitting couple!

221
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,870
U-Um...

222
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,810
Can I ask for... the next dance?

223
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,110
Hey, that's not fair.
I would like the next dance...

224
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,700
Young lady, I would
like the next dance...

225
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,740
No, with me...

226
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,620
U-Um, hello...?

227
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,650
Oh, boy, the next
dance already started.

228
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,760
Hey, Mako-chan, guys...
What are all of you doing?

229
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,630
Hey, Mamo-chan...

230
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,660
H-Haruka...

231
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,930
I-Impossible!

232
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,300
What in the world...

233
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,860
...have we been doing?

234
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,340
Young ladies...

235
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,200
Dancing is a fine thing,
but how about something else?

236
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,610
Can I ask you to join
me for a little while?

237
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,550
I can show you a very special place.

238
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,610
A special place?

239
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,290
Wow, this is beautiful!

240
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,120
How beautiful!

241
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,630
Hey, that area must
be the Juban district.

242
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,290
I feel like I'm in some dream!

243
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,420
I take it that you
are satisfied with this?

244
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,630
Yes! It truly is wonderful!

245
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,230
Thank you very much.

246
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:22,000
My dream is that young individuals
nurture a beautiful future...

247
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,310
...much like the
flowers in this garden.

248
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,280
I am looking forward to
all of your futures as well.

249
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,310
Well, I will have drinks
and some cake brought out now.

250
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,250
Yippee!

251
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,150
U-Usagi...

252
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,150
To make such beautiful flowers bloom...

253
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,460
Mr. Edwards is such
a kindhearted person.

254
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,120
A waltz, young people full of hope,
and Mr. Edwards' pure heart...

255
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,660
It's just as though this mansion
is filled with a rosy future...

256
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,840
No! Don't open that door!

257
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,350
Oh, no!

258
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,320
W-What in the world is this?

259
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,060
Y-Young lady...

260
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,050
Hurry outside!
Young lady?

261
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,430
Edwards!

262
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,270
Captured!!

263
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,040
Well, you do want to
choose your own cake.

264
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,850
What is this smoke!?

265
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,250
This one looks very likely...

266
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,820
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

267
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,260
MAKE UP!

268
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,010
URANUS PLANET POWER...

269
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,450
MAKE UP!

270
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,790
DEEP...

271
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,430
...SUBMERGE!

272
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,300
We can't let you take this.

273
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,040
Daimohn!!

274
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,340
Backing up, backing up...

275
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,950
Appear, Daimohn!

276
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,020
Daimohn?

277
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,990
Hey, what are you doing!?

278
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,700
T-The dress is...

279
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,720
...heavy...

280
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,560
Oh, I have a headache...

281
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,470
I want to go home now...

282
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,990
Not so fast!

283
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,970
The bell for midnight
hasn't struck yet!

284
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,240
If you're already saying
that you're going home, you...

285
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,340
...definitely aren't Cinderella.

286
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,680
An intruder, an uninvited one!

287
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,310
The witch in Sleeping Beauty,
the evil lord in Swan Lake...

288
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,450
Villains who disrupt
parties are always defeated!

289
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,630
Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty,
Princess Odette, and... ur...

290
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,650
In the name of all the others!

291
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,190
We'll punish you!

292
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,200
Another cause for a headache!

293
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,900
This isn't a talisman.

294
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,370
There you have it.

295
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,000
It was a wasted trip, Eugeal.

296
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,770
So my bad feeling was right!

297
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,010
Chiquon!

298
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,670
Chiquon!

299
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,580
So, I'm leaving the rest for you!

300
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,520
Chiquon!

301
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,720
UN DEUX TROIS!

302
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,320
UN DEUX TROIS!

303
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,930
Sailor Moon!

304
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,440
Chiquon!

305
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,690
I can't stand to watch this.

306
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,010
WORLD...

307
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,210
...SHAKING!

308
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,920
Uranus!

309
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,520
Whoops, was that unnecessary?

310
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,290
How do you do?

311
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,360
Chiquon!

312
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,520
Oh, it hasn't been defeated yet!

313
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,550
It's rather persistent!

314
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,800
Chiquon!

315
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,240
Hell's Waltz!

316
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,510
What in the world is this!?

317
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,910
What is this!?
Even if you throw musical notes...

318
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,650
This is totally unfair!

319
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,450
If you're a record player, why can't you
fight using music like a record player!?

320
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,290
Sheesh!

321
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,820
You have a good point there.

322
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,690
In that case...

323
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,560
A brand-new composition that
I just finished right now!

324
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,060
The Devil's Yodel!

325
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,960
It hurts!

326
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,800
W-What is with this sound!?

327
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,800
This sound stimulates and destroys
the central nervous system of people!

328
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,170
Who is it!?

329
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,250
The sound of music is
meant to be appreciated!

330
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,690
It is not something to
give pain to other people!

331
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,460
Tuxedo Mask!

332
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,190
I will not forgive anyone
who defiles beautiful music!

333
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,770
Oh, no, my last weapon!

334
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,770
Now, Sailor Moon!

335
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:54,760
Okay!

336
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,930
MOON SPIRAL...

337
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,990
...HEART...

338
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,530
...ATTACK!

339
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,800
I shouldn't have thrown away the bell!

340
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,770
LOVELY!

341
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,130
Did I fall asleep or something?

342
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,230
Oh? I didn't notice anything...

343
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,370
Oh, man, they look so happy...

344
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,070
I'm jealous...

345
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,010
Oh, yeah, where's Haruka?
I have to ask her for a dance!

346
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,780
All right!
We can play rock-paper-scissors again!

347
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,010
- All right!
- Y-You guys...

348
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,520
Believing only in a rosy future, and
entrusting that dream to the next generation.

349
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,020
I guess that's one way to live.

350
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,190
But we have no time left. The silence
of this world is quickly approaching.

351
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,820
To prevent that from happening, we
must hurry up and find the talismans...

352
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,820
