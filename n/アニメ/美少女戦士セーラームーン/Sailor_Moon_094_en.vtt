00:02.282 --> 00:04.716
You want to have
your first kiss...

00:04.751 --> 00:07.015
...in a romantic setting
with someone you love!

00:07.054 --> 00:09.784
It's the dream of any girl!

00:10.524 --> 00:13.084
I can't forgive those
who lack delicacy...

00:13.126 --> 00:15.594
...and stomp on a
maiden's pure heart...

00:15.629 --> 00:17.790
...going after the hearts
that yearn for a kiss!

00:17.831 --> 00:20.425
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

00:25.014 --> 00:27.676
We're studying at Rei's
place again today...

00:27.717 --> 00:29.685
It's tough having
entrance exams!

00:29.719 --> 00:31.619
What are you saying?

00:32.421 --> 00:34.355
Don't stall yourself
around here!

00:34.390 --> 00:36.017
We should get going!

00:36.058 --> 00:38.526
Otherwise Rei and the
others will yell at you again.

00:38.561 --> 00:40.825
But...

00:41.998 --> 00:45.627
Studying on such a
wonderful day like today?

00:45.668 --> 00:50.401
I feel like I'm wasting
my precious adolescence.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.837
I won't be responsible if
you end up in tears later.

00:54.043 --> 00:57.945
Oh, I wish I could go on a
date with Mamo-chan...

01:02.652 --> 01:04.882
My wish came true!

01:04.921 --> 01:06.650
Mamo-chan!

01:06.689 --> 01:08.589
Usagi!
What about your studies!?

01:08.624 --> 01:10.455
Mamo-chan!

01:14.997 --> 01:16.931
M-Mamo-chan...

01:25.841 --> 01:28.275
Who is that...? That person...?

01:28.311 --> 01:29.938
Usako!

01:35.484 --> 01:36.712
Unazuki?

01:36.752 --> 01:38.811
Hello, Usagi.

01:38.854 --> 01:41.118
Unazuki...
Why are you..?

01:41.857 --> 01:45.520
My brother Motoki is such a klutz.
He said he was going on a trip...

01:45.561 --> 01:48.086
...but forgot the ticket
when he left the house!

01:48.130 --> 01:50.928
So, I rushed out of
the house after him...

01:50.967 --> 01:53.162
That was when I was
passing by their place.

01:53.202 --> 01:56.433
And so Mamoru took me
to the train station!

01:56.472 --> 01:58.372
Oh, I see...

01:58.407 --> 02:00.204
Sheesh, don't surprise
me like that!

02:01.177 --> 02:03.270
What are you talking about?

02:03.312 --> 02:05.610
Oh, nothing!

02:06.983 --> 02:10.384
By the way, Mamo-chan, that
riding suit is wonderful!

02:10.419 --> 02:12.148
You look really
good in it!

02:12.188 --> 02:14.588
- Damn, you're handsome!
- You think so?

02:14.623 --> 02:17.683
You're so well-proportioned,
you look good in anything.

02:18.194 --> 02:20.185
Hey, hey... Usako...

02:21.897 --> 02:24.092
A kiss with Mamo-chan?

02:24.500 --> 02:27.958
Wha-- Usagi, you don't
have to say it so loud!

02:29.405 --> 02:31.339
And what about it,
Usagi?

02:31.374 --> 02:33.365
Have you kissed Mamoru yet?

02:34.677 --> 02:36.804
Uh, well...

02:39.515 --> 02:40.743
I see...

02:40.783 --> 02:43.547
After all, since you're
blushing so much...

02:45.421 --> 02:46.979
You haven't kissed yet!

02:48.858 --> 02:50.052
Well... That's...

02:50.092 --> 02:53.425
Of course. It would be
bad for you to kiss now...

02:53.462 --> 02:55.794
...since you're still in
junior high, Usagi.

02:56.499 --> 02:59.127
And you've got entrance
exams this year to boot!

02:59.635 --> 03:04.231
Y-Yeah... I'm a poor little
student with entrance exams...

03:04.573 --> 03:08.031
W-What about you, Unazuki?
You're in high school...

03:08.077 --> 03:10.068
You've kissed a boy, right?

03:13.149 --> 03:15.140
I can't really say
this too loudly...

03:17.553 --> 03:18.679
I...

03:21.023 --> 03:24.049
I do have a boyfriend
that I love...

03:26.062 --> 03:27.893
...but I haven't
kissed him yet.

03:29.765 --> 03:33.531
Why, why? If you love him,
why don't you kiss him?

03:34.036 --> 03:35.230
Because...

03:35.271 --> 03:37.865
I want to cherish
my first kiss...

03:38.340 --> 03:42.470
...with someone I really love!
At the perfect time and place!

03:42.711 --> 03:45.646
Until then, I want to save it...

03:46.315 --> 03:48.806
Isn't it normal to
think that way?

03:53.756 --> 03:55.280
Haruka!

03:55.925 --> 03:57.290
Michiru!

04:01.030 --> 04:03.794
So cute, to be
dreaming of kisses.

04:04.533 --> 04:06.524
Oh, I think it's romantic.

04:06.869 --> 04:10.737
Do both of you know about the
first kiss in world history?

04:13.008 --> 04:16.842
The first people to kiss in
this world were Adam and Eve.

04:25.087 --> 04:27.112
There are many
different kisses.

04:27.389 --> 04:29.584
The kiss on the back of the
hand of someone you look up to.

04:29.625 --> 04:31.957
A kiss of friendship
on someone's forehead.

04:31.994 --> 04:34.462
A kiss on the palm of one's
hand to wish for something.

04:35.664 --> 04:38.098
You really know a
lot of things, Haruka.

04:38.134 --> 04:41.001
In 15th-century Italy,
it was said...

04:41.036 --> 04:46.406
...that if a young couple kissed,
they had to get married.

04:48.410 --> 04:50.002
They were really strict.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.672
A first kiss...

04:52.715 --> 04:54.808
You want to cherish it.

05:00.256 --> 05:02.053
See ya!

05:06.529 --> 05:10.260
Haruka and Michiru
are so mature...

05:13.802 --> 05:14.962
Oh, that's right, Usagi!

05:15.004 --> 05:16.869
I have a lot of
delicious cakes!

05:16.906 --> 05:18.396
You should come visit my
place later and have some!

05:18.440 --> 05:19.998
Bring your friends, too!

05:20.042 --> 05:22.067
Really?! I'll go, I'll go!

05:22.111 --> 05:24.705
Now, I have to work!
Well, I'll see you later!

05:24.747 --> 05:25.975
Sure!

05:26.015 --> 05:28.415
Cake! A cake!

05:29.885 --> 05:31.876
I'm such a kid after all...

05:37.393 --> 05:39.258
A first kiss, huh..?

05:40.196 --> 05:42.630
They are just so cute...
It's nice.

05:42.665 --> 05:46.192
We don't have the luxury to
be falling in love right now.

05:46.235 --> 05:47.998
It's dangerous.

05:48.037 --> 05:53.168
Honest girls like that are
easily targeted by the Daimohn.

05:54.877 --> 05:57.471
You're right.
The owner of a pure heart...

05:57.513 --> 05:59.378
We have to be careful.

06:05.654 --> 06:07.417
Kaorinite...

06:07.456 --> 06:08.423
Yes.

06:08.457 --> 06:10.857
You have been
piling up failures...

06:10.893 --> 06:14.021
But I'm sure you have
found a new target?

06:14.396 --> 06:15.886
Yes!

06:17.566 --> 06:21.559
A girl with a pure heart
that dreams ofa first kiss.

06:22.538 --> 06:23.903
A kiss, huh?

06:23.939 --> 06:26.169
I haven't done such
a thing in years...

06:49.298 --> 06:51.061
I guess this is it.

06:56.038 --> 06:58.768
My first kiss...
With someone I love...

07:00.342 --> 07:03.004
Am I putting too much
thought into this?

07:35.444 --> 07:37.503
O---SO---JI!

07:42.885 --> 07:44.785
OSOJI!

07:45.220 --> 07:46.812
Suction!

08:08.110 --> 08:10.135
The talisman is mine!

08:10.179 --> 08:12.113
We won't let
you have that!

08:14.483 --> 08:16.178
Who is it!?

08:16.218 --> 08:19.619
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Uranus...

08:19.655 --> 08:21.122
...acts with elegance!

08:21.156 --> 08:22.123
Likewise...

08:22.157 --> 08:24.250
...I am Sailor Neptune!

08:27.296 --> 08:29.321
This is what I've taken!

08:29.365 --> 08:31.492
I won't let you have it!

08:31.967 --> 08:34.094
OSOJI...

08:34.403 --> 08:35.335
HURRICANE!

08:39.108 --> 08:42.669
WORLD SHAKING!

08:48.384 --> 08:49.851
It's mine!

08:51.053 --> 08:52.748
OSOJI!

08:54.189 --> 08:55.747
Drat!

08:56.158 --> 08:57.625
The crystal!!

08:57.659 --> 08:59.388
Hold it right there!

09:04.666 --> 09:06.429
OSOJI!

09:06.769 --> 09:08.600
Where's the talisman?

09:08.804 --> 09:10.601
Where is it!?

09:17.413 --> 09:20.211
WHERE IS IT?!!

09:21.116 --> 09:23.448
Unazuki!

09:23.485 --> 09:25.476
I'm here with everyone!

09:25.954 --> 09:26.886
Really...

09:26.922 --> 09:29.948
I was wondering where you ran off to,
keeping everyone waiting...?

09:29.992 --> 09:32.187
- Well, it's all right, thanks to Usagi...
- Oh, I want to clean...

09:32.227 --> 09:34.889
- ...we'll be eating cake in the end, right?
- ...Motoki's room for him again...

09:34.930 --> 09:36.761
Besides, we can study anywhere.

09:36.799 --> 09:38.426
Ami, you planned to have...

09:38.467 --> 09:40.628
...the study group
at Unazuki's place?

09:40.669 --> 09:42.432
Was that a bad idea?

09:43.138 --> 09:44.537
Usagi...

09:45.674 --> 09:46.902
This is strange.

09:46.942 --> 09:50.241
Maybe Unazuki isn't
back from her job yet.

09:51.346 --> 09:53.075
Huh? It's open...

09:57.119 --> 09:58.586
Unazuki!

10:23.479 --> 10:24.741
Unazuki!

10:25.514 --> 10:26.105
What's wrong!?

10:26.181 --> 10:27.307
This is...!?

10:27.349 --> 10:29.817
Her pure heart crystal
has been taken away!

10:31.053 --> 10:34.079
If we don't follow the Daimohn fast
and get it back, Unazuki will...!

10:34.122 --> 10:36.556
But, where should we look?

10:41.296 --> 10:43.594
Where are you!?

10:43.632 --> 10:46.226
Where, where, where, where,
where, where are you!?

10:49.137 --> 10:50.331
Here it is!

10:50.372 --> 10:53.136
It's a good thing the
tick sensor was on it!

10:54.743 --> 10:55.903
Ami, have you
figured it out!?

10:55.944 --> 10:58.208
Within a 10-km radius,
towards the north...

10:58.247 --> 11:01.444
I'm sorry, but I can't
be any more specific.

11:01.483 --> 11:04.475
In any case, we have to
split up and look for them!

11:04.520 --> 11:06.750
Everyone should keep in touch!

11:06.788 --> 11:08.688
Everyone have
their communicators?

11:08.724 --> 11:09.918
Yeah.

11:15.697 --> 11:16.789
A kiss...

11:18.300 --> 11:20.291
I want to kiss!

11:22.104 --> 11:24.436
W-What's gotten into her!?

11:25.507 --> 11:27.702
Unazuki!
Pull yourself together!

11:27.743 --> 11:29.711
I want to kiss!
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

11:29.745 --> 11:31.212
- NO!
- Unazuki!

11:31.246 --> 11:34.841
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

11:34.883 --> 11:36.874
Come on,
get yourself together!

11:37.352 --> 11:39.343
You said that your
first kiss was precious!

11:39.388 --> 11:41.015
That you were waiting for
someone you really love!

11:41.056 --> 11:44.321
And it would be at the best
place at the best time, right!?

11:44.359 --> 11:47.351
Right, Unazuki!?

11:47.396 --> 11:49.956
I don't care who!
I want to kiss!

11:50.532 --> 11:55.162
Perhaps she became impure
because her pure heart was stolen!

11:55.737 --> 11:57.329
Is that how it works...?

11:57.372 --> 11:58.999
Yes, I'm sure of it!

11:59.675 --> 12:02.269
EVIL SPIRITS, BEGONE!

12:06.048 --> 12:07.982
I'll look after Unazuki!

12:08.016 --> 12:11.508
Everyone, hurry and find the
crystal of her pure heart!

12:14.690 --> 12:15.987
But...

12:16.024 --> 12:17.548
...what in the world...

12:17.593 --> 12:20.323
...do we use as a
clue to look for it!?

12:20.362 --> 12:21.590
Usagi!

12:22.230 --> 12:25.722
There's a Daimohn
3-km away from you!

12:25.767 --> 12:27.564
Everyone, hurry over there!

12:27.603 --> 12:29.594
Got it, Ami!

12:30.505 --> 12:31.437
Mamo-chan!

12:31.473 --> 12:34.101
Usako! If you're
in a hurry, get on!

12:47.389 --> 12:48.321
Everyone!

12:48.357 --> 12:51.485
Hurry and bring back the
crystal of her pure heart...!

12:51.526 --> 12:54.495
At this rate,
Unazuki will die!

12:58.800 --> 13:00.859
Usagi! It's in that area!

13:00.902 --> 13:02.494
Okay!

13:04.773 --> 13:07.537
It's in HERE!?

13:15.317 --> 13:16.443
A Daimohn!

13:16.485 --> 13:18.885
It's got a pure heart crystal!

13:18.920 --> 13:21.320
That must be Unazuki's!

13:24.192 --> 13:29.926
MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!

14:04.733 --> 14:07.293
You are as pesky
as little ticks!

14:07.803 --> 14:10.067
Cooperate and give
us the talisman!

14:10.105 --> 14:12.403
This is what I took!

14:12.441 --> 14:14.807
If you want it, you have
to wrestle it away from me!

14:14.843 --> 14:16.367
No!

14:16.411 --> 14:19.812
I won't let ANYONE have
that pure heart crystal!

14:20.549 --> 14:23.609
A girl who dreams of a first
kiss with a wonderful boy...!

14:24.586 --> 14:27.783
I can't forgive you for
stealing such a pure heart!

14:28.824 --> 14:32.191
For love and justice,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

14:32.227 --> 14:33.819
Sailor Moon!

14:35.497 --> 14:38.898
In the name of the moon,
I punish you!

14:40.302 --> 14:42.327
We have another tick!?

14:43.371 --> 14:46.067
I can't allow
for any ticks!!

14:49.711 --> 14:51.474
Gust of wind!

14:58.620 --> 15:00.019
Shut up!

15:00.522 --> 15:02.683
Take these
pieces of trash!

15:10.766 --> 15:11.733
Ow...

15:11.767 --> 15:13.997
I won't lose to someone like you!

15:18.874 --> 15:20.171
Unazuki...

15:22.210 --> 15:25.179
I have to save... Unazuki...

15:31.953 --> 15:34.080
All of you,
pile up and DIE!

15:41.530 --> 15:43.293
A crystal of a pure heart...

15:43.331 --> 15:46.232
...does not fit someone
with a soiled heart!

15:46.268 --> 15:47.963
Return the crystal now...

15:48.003 --> 15:50.563
...and be buried along
with this scrap metal!

15:50.605 --> 15:52.300
Tuxedo Mask!

15:56.511 --> 15:59.742
Sailor Moon! Show it
the power of justice!

16:00.949 --> 16:01.745
Right!

16:21.703 --> 16:29.633
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

16:39.421 --> 16:43.755
LOVELY!

16:56.771 --> 16:59.331
Oh, no!
The pure heart crystal...!

16:59.674 --> 17:01.335
I won't let you have it!

17:04.012 --> 17:06.242
We will take the talisman!

17:09.117 --> 17:10.641
I won't let you have it!

17:13.221 --> 17:14.279
Let me go!

17:14.322 --> 17:16.722
If I don't give that back,
Unazuki is going to die!

17:17.659 --> 17:19.593
I know that we're
going to have casualties!

17:19.628 --> 17:21.118
Then, why...!?

17:21.162 --> 17:23.153
It's nothing that
you would understand!

17:23.765 --> 17:25.858
It is our duty!

17:26.968 --> 17:29.129
We must get a hold of it!

17:30.672 --> 17:31.934
Sailor Moon!

17:34.109 --> 17:35.667
This is...!

17:35.911 --> 17:37.538
It's not a talisman.

17:37.579 --> 17:39.979
It's only a normal
pure heart crystal!

17:40.015 --> 17:41.448
What!?

17:42.951 --> 17:44.714
Give it back!

17:46.721 --> 17:48.951
I'll never let you have it!

17:53.428 --> 17:55.419
Do what you want with it...

17:58.967 --> 18:01.128
What does this mean...?

18:05.507 --> 18:07.737
Sailor Moon!

18:07.776 --> 18:10.142
Sailor Moon!

18:10.712 --> 18:14.011
Come on, let's hurry
back to Unazuki!

18:17.419 --> 18:19.353
That girl who was dreaming
about her first kiss...

18:19.387 --> 18:20.854
I wonder if
she'll be saved?

18:20.889 --> 18:22.914
She'll probably
be all right.

18:24.092 --> 18:25.787
Somehow...

18:26.328 --> 18:29.889
I'm glad that it
wasn't a talisman.

18:30.365 --> 18:31.662
What are you saying?

18:31.700 --> 18:34.430
No matter what happens,
we must find the talismans!

18:34.469 --> 18:35.731
You're right...

18:35.770 --> 18:39.399
Because that is the duty
that we were given.

18:55.924 --> 18:57.892
Unazuki's body...!

18:57.926 --> 18:59.223
I'm so glad!

19:00.862 --> 19:03.729
Now she won't
kiss just anyone!

19:03.765 --> 19:06.563
You have to kiss someone
you love, after all!

19:07.202 --> 19:09.898
That's right!
In Italy, long ago...

19:09.938 --> 19:15.376
...if a boy and a girl kissed,
they had to get married!

19:15.643 --> 19:17.838
That's how
important a kiss is!

19:18.480 --> 19:21.608
But, Usagi, we know
somebody who often does...

19:21.649 --> 19:24.846
...such an important thing
with a certain someone.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.954
That's right. For now,
we have to think more...

19:27.989 --> 19:30.924
...about the entrance
exams than romance.

19:30.959 --> 19:33.519
Now, let's begin
our study group!

19:34.529 --> 19:37.157
You really are going
to start it here!?

19:37.198 --> 19:38.927
I can't believe it!

19:38.967 --> 19:40.525
If we don't start right now...

19:40.568 --> 19:42.798
...we won't be done with
what we have to cover today!

19:43.304 --> 19:46.205
I'm glad Unazuki
is back to normal.

19:46.441 --> 19:49.467
Yeah. Unazuki's
cherished dream as well.

19:49.511 --> 19:51.001
A first kiss...

19:51.046 --> 19:53.412
Unazuki's dream is
a wonderful thing.

19:53.748 --> 19:58.412
I'm kinda happy that I was able
to protect her wonderful dream.

19:58.686 --> 20:00.847
I guess...

20:06.861 --> 20:08.488
H-Hey, Mamo-chan...

20:08.530 --> 20:10.998
Do you remember
our first kiss?

20:13.201 --> 20:15.465
Um, that's...

20:16.871 --> 20:18.395
Mamo-chan?

20:18.907 --> 20:21.102
By some chance,
you don't remember...?

20:21.142 --> 20:22.609
A-As I was saying...

20:22.644 --> 20:24.134
Well, that's not
worth talking about...

20:24.179 --> 20:27.080
NO! A first kiss is
really important!

20:27.115 --> 20:29.174
The moon is really
beautiful tonight, Usako.

20:29.217 --> 20:30.912
Mamo-chan!

20:33.912 --> 20:37.912
