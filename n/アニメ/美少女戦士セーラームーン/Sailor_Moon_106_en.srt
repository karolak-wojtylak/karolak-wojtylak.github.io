1
00:00:02,182 --> 00:00:05,049
Haruka and Michiru are very beautiful.

2
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:08,111
I'm sure that they met each
other in a very wonderful way.

3
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:12,717
Especially since Haruka said that
Michiru was "more than a lover"...

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:13,851
Maybe...

5
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:15,555
No! No way!
Hey, now...

6
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:17,688
You with the perverted
thought over there!

7
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,564
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,536
Back then, I wanted
to become the wind.

9
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:37,608
I just wanted to be like the wind...

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:40,979
Wrestling free from
the domination of gravity...

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,488
...and plunging forth into
the vast reaches of the sky...

12
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:47,185
That was the kind of
person I wanted to be...

13
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:05,601
If I think about it, back then...

14
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:09,081
I was merely fighting to
escape from my destiny.

15
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:13,978
No matter when it was,
what I won from my battles...

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,581
...were all new parts of myself.

17
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:24,963
The wind is rustling about...

18
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,870
Exercise in moderation is
a good stimulus for the brain.

19
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:37,375
Oh, I think I might have an idea!

20
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,469
I guess I'll go for the final touch.

21
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:41,745
Here it comes, here it comes!

22
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:43,476
The last spurt!

23
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:50,989
Yes, Eugeal here.

24
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:54,519
This next target, you know...

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,496
How about we have a
track-and-field athlete?

26
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:00,556
Okay...

27
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,362
I have found one.

28
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:03,993
Good.

29
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:09,006
Then, I will prepare you a Daimohn
that is best suited for this purpose...

30
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:30,595
Hurdler!

31
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:06,426
I see, a huge gymnasium...

32
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:10,094
If I get accepted here next year, maybe
I'll start playing volleyball again.

33
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:12,832
You'll be all right...
I'm sure you'll be accepted.

34
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:16,364
You guys have been working
really hard lately, Minako.

35
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:18,968
I said that THEY have been.

36
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:20,035
Rei...

37
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,068
What?

38
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:22,842
That nonchalant look...

39
00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:25,043
For some reason,
I was really hurt by that.

40
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:25,948
Oh, really?

41
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:29,512
I felt our friendship on the rocks,
and I'm not kidding when I say that.

42
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:32,149
Oh? I wonder why?

43
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:33,120
Come on, let's go.

44
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,751
Yeah, you have it easy.

45
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:38,252
TA Girls School has a high school,
and you automatically move up to it...

46
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:40,629
...like an escalator! What a breeze!

47
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,566
You'll be fine too, Usagi.

48
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,193
Ami!

49
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:47,569
No matter what school it is, you can
get in if you pass the entrance exams.

50
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,078
That really doesn't make
her feel better, Ami...

51
00:03:58,918 --> 00:04:00,408
Rei, you are such a meanie!

52
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:02,386
I just stated the truth.

53
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:04,548
- You know... Rei, you can...
- What!?

54
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,854
Hey... Over there...

55
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:08,018
It's Elsa Gray.

56
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,788
Who is that?

57
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:11,626
That's Elsa Gray. You don't know her?

58
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:14,565
She's a sprinter and hurdler that competes
at the national championship level.

59
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,228
She's a celebrity at this school.

60
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:33,017
I see... You're visiting our campus...

61
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:34,679
So you're going to come here next year?

62
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,951
Well, we're not sure yet.

63
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,184
M-Miss Elsa?

64
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:47,864
You have nice, firm glutes.

65
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,697
Both of you are fit for running track.

66
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:52,597
If you decide to come here,
join our team.

67
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,964
You're a strange person, Elsa.

68
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,105
You can join as their manager, too.

69
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:00,975
I know that I'm not athletic at all!

70
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:02,537
But I wouldn't expect anything less.

71
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:05,209
Even though the team has the day off,
you're practicing by yourself...

72
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,377
I used to be confident
about my running.

73
00:05:10,422 --> 00:05:13,585
But there was one person
who I just couldn't beat...

74
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:21,230
She always passed by me,
just like the wind.

75
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:28,336
I heard she already quit running track,
but I was never able to win against her.

76
00:05:29,308 --> 00:05:33,244
Even now, I'm still
running in her shadow...

77
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:36,972
She's kinda cool...

78
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,249
- See ya.
- Thank you very much.

79
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:48,750
Target confirmed.

80
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:56,366
So I have to work
hard and study more...

81
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:00,867
That's right, Usagi.

82
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:04,837
You're not stupid, Usagi.
It's all about concentration.

83
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:06,606
Let's do our best, Usagi.

84
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:07,703
Where there's a will, there's a way!

85
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:10,476
Guys... Yeah.

86
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:15,749
Captured!

87
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:20,048
Something I could expect
from a track athlete.

88
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:23,060
You sure can run away quickly...

89
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:25,921
Hold it right there!

90
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:32,794
I won't allow bad girls to harass
someone's wholesome high-school life!

91
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:36,597
For love and justice...

92
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:38,507
The sailor team!

93
00:06:38,544 --> 00:06:40,444
In the name of the moon...

94
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,673
...we'll punish you!

95
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:43,914
You guys again.

96
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:46,747
Appear, Daimohn!

97
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:56,121
Hurdler!

98
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:02,165
Hurdler, eliminate those
who get in our way.

99
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:02,860
Yes!

100
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:05,603
Leave this to me, guys!

101
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:12,041
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

102
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:14,675
HURDLING!

103
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:15,779
What!?

104
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:18,305
HARD LINE!

105
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:22,787
Let's draw lines so
they're all straight!

106
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:31,226
This is Haruka.

107
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:33,288
I'm at Shirakaba High School
in the S district.

108
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:34,458
Okay...

109
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,694
The one under attack...

110
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:37,361
...is Elsa Gray.

111
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:39,428
I see...

112
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:40,028
Yeah.

113
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,406
Help!

114
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,670
I won't let you escape!

115
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:44,865
Miss Elsa!

116
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:51,377
Michiru and I knew Elsa Gray.

117
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,184
Elsa was the one who
introduced me to Michiru.

118
00:07:56,221 --> 00:08:00,715
That was before I had
awakened as Sailor Uranus.

119
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:05,454
The illusion of destruction
had cast a shadow upon my heart.

120
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:07,988
The silence is approaching.

121
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:11,759
We must find the Messiah quickly.

122
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:13,328
The ones who can do that...

123
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:16,307
...are you, and I.

124
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:23,274
That again...

125
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:25,749
I hear you're very fast.

126
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:27,149
But I won't lose.

127
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:29,984
On your marks...

128
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:32,522
Ready!

129
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,654
Back then, I was just fighting
to escape from my own destiny.

130
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:44,067
No matter what sport I played,
there wasn't anyone who could beat me.

131
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,230
Track-and-field was
the same as the others...

132
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:49,138
I was just running to keep
myself from being bored...

133
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:54,635
In the end, the only thing that
kept my interest was motor sports...

134
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,140
Back then, the circuit
was everything to me.

135
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:03,018
If I had not met
Michiru Kaioh back then...

136
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:04,647
Miss Haruka Tenoh!

137
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:08,723
I had heard rumors about you.
You really ARE amazing.

138
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,660
I have someone I want
to introduce to you.

139
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:13,161
Come on over, Michiru.

140
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,766
This is Michiru Kaioh.

141
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:18,964
She's really intelligent AND she's
said to be a prodigious painter.

142
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:21,131
She says she's interested in you.

143
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:24,005
You aren't sweating at all...

144
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:26,476
Perhaps you were holding
back quite a bit?

145
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:28,275
What do you mean...?

146
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:31,305
Can't you hear the
sound of wind rustling?

147
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:35,245
That was when I realized...

148
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,687
...that she was THE person.

149
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:41,557
And that she knew
exactly who I was, too.

150
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:45,159
I was born with
the destiny of a soldier.

151
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:48,564
But, in my heart, I didn't
want to acknowledge that fact yet...

152
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,500
...because I had a hunch
that if I did...

153
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:53,334
...I was pretty sure that
everything around me would change.

154
00:09:53,772 --> 00:09:55,000
You're weird.

155
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,531
So, what do you want with me?

156
00:09:57,576 --> 00:10:00,170
Will you be a model
for one of my drawings?

157
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:01,577
I'll pass.

158
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:05,140
I don't like stuff like that...

159
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:50,852
That girl is Michiru Kaioh.

160
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:52,761
She sure doesn't look
like a junior high student.

161
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:54,356
She must be quite popular
at school, don't you think?

162
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,663
I heard that she
doesn't make many friends.

163
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:59,193
I wonder why.
She looks like a wonderful girl...

164
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:01,604
Yeah... I heard that
she doesn't like people...

165
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:24,125
Did you find it to your liking?

166
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:26,562
Thank you for coming here tonight.

167
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:29,396
Miss Haruka Tenoh,
the prodigious racer.

168
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:32,767
You seem to know
quite a bit about me...

169
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:34,704
This piece...
Did you paint it...?

170
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,640
You're rather famous.

171
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:41,309
There are a lot of freakish fans
of yours at my school as well...

172
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:44,247
One of them is a girl,
but she says she still wants...

173
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:47,150
...to go cruising along
the beach in your car.

174
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:51,117
The end of the world, huh?

175
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:53,852
I'm surprised that
a well-to-do girl who...

176
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:57,623
...can't even kill one bug can
draw such a tragic fantasy.

177
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:59,290
It's not a fantasy!

178
00:11:59,331 --> 00:12:01,663
I can see THAT scene clearly!

179
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:04,626
Just like you can...

180
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:13,003
This is stupid.

181
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:15,912
I'm Haruka Tenoh,
the first Junior racer in Japan.

182
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:20,615
Memories of my previous life or the end
of the world have nothing to do with me.

183
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:24,281
If someone has to do it,
then YOU can do it.

184
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:27,690
I would like you to stop
investigating me like that, though.

185
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:32,187
Don't say such selfish
things like that...!

186
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:34,496
I don't want to do it, either...

187
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:38,367
I also have a dream --
to become a violinist...

188
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:42,430
I can't do something stupid like
saving the world from destruction.

189
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:58,119
Is someone there?

190
00:12:58,156 --> 00:12:59,714
Help me...

191
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:01,720
What's wrong?
Are you all right?

192
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,625
Help me...

193
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,827
What!?

194
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,302
You... MONSTER!

195
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:18,808
Help me...

196
00:13:49,174 --> 00:13:51,165
Don't do it!

197
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,106
Don't grab that.

198
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:57,971
Once you grab a hold of it...

199
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:02,350
...you will never again
return to mundane life.

200
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:23,608
You can't!

201
00:14:23,642 --> 00:14:25,735
He was human until
just a few minutes ago!

202
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:28,507
Are you all right doing this!?
This is murder!!

203
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:31,241
The silence is approaching...

204
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:34,548
If I don't do this, there
will be even more victims!

205
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,821
Are you saying that's why you
don't care how you accomplish it!?

206
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:37,879
That's right!

207
00:14:37,923 --> 00:14:39,788
I don't care what means I use!

208
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,793
Are you really satisfied--

209
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:44,188
Look out!

210
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:56,738
DEEP SUBMERGE!

211
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:14,219
Where's the monster...?

212
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:16,352
He turned back into a human.

213
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:18,089
He's all right.

214
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:20,256
I might have killed him.

215
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:23,358
No... Next time, I'm sure I'll kill.

216
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:29,535
It's not that I'm fine with it.
But I am a soldier...

217
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:32,236
Because I chose to do this.

218
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:36,179
Then why did you
cover for me just now...?

219
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:40,116
If you hurt your hand, you won't
be able to become a violinist.

220
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:41,413
I...

221
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:46,447
I didn't investigate you because
you were the other soldier.

222
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:49,389
It goes back much further than
when I realized you were the one.

223
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:54,963
I was watching you in your
first race from close by.

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,401
I wanted to cruise along the
beach in your car... just once...

225
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,695
You don't rely on anyone at all.

226
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,800
And you are always
honest to your feelings.

227
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:06,606
I'm not honest at all...

228
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:08,135
I keep running away.

229
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:11,580
I know about you more than you do...

230
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:13,880
Because I've always been watching you.

231
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,357
You are the one person I don't want to
see walking the same path that I did...

232
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:25,057
But... when I realized that you
were the one... I was happy...

233
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:27,421
I'm sorry...

234
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:30,525
I didn't mean to tell you all this...

235
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:33,163
I'm sorry...

236
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:42,509
And so... I...

237
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,013
Looks like it's time for work.

238
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:48,910
Yeah...

239
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,922
Let's go, Michiru!

240
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:52,617
All right, Haruka!

241
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:55,822
URANUS PLANET POWER...

242
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,260
MAKE UP!

243
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,442
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

244
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:15,878
MAKE UP!

245
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:34,093
WORLD...

246
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:36,498
...SHAKING!

247
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,959
What!?

248
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:40,994
No!

249
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:53,177
Coming out all in a mess... Sheesh!

250
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:55,709
Hurdler, I'm leaving
the rest of it to you!

251
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:58,518
Leave it to me!
HARD LINE!

252
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:05,025
I don't fall for the same
trick THAT many times!

253
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:09,966
BURNING...

254
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:12,697
...MANDALA!

255
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,229
DASH!

256
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,304
I'm sorry, but you
can't run away from me.

257
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:19,935
Because I am the wind.

258
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:23,441
Now, Neptune!

259
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:29,743
DEEP...

260
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:32,313
...SUBMERGE!

261
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:34,756
You can't!

262
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:35,555
Look out!

263
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:42,396
Now!

264
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:06,623
MOON SPIRAL...

265
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:09,627
...HEART...

266
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:12,095
...ATTACK!

267
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:25,103
LOVELY!

268
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:37,687
How is it?

269
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:39,986
Looks like this isn't it.

270
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:56,807
It's a little frustrating...
But the two of them sure do it well.

271
00:19:58,343 --> 00:20:01,744
So, I chose this path.

272
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,911
No, I just acknowledged the
fact that I am a sailor soldier...

273
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,819
Yes. I must find the Messiah
that will save the world...

274
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,487
I am not allowed to stand in one place.
My days are filled with battles.

275
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:19,520
But...

276
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:21,327
I'm glad I was able to meet you...

277
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:23,726
What?

278
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:26,430
Let's cruise together
like this forever...

279
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:27,961
I won't let you go home tonight.

280
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:29,598
Oh, my!

281
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,598
