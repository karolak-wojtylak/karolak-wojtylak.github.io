00:02.282 --> 00:06.878
Suddenly a beautiful boy named Haruka
Tenoh appears before our eyes!

00:06.920 --> 00:11.186
He brings a beautiful girl with him. Is
this what you call a picturesque couple?

00:11.224 --> 00:14.193
And the mysterious soldiers
finally show themselves!

00:14.227 --> 00:20.132
If you are bad girls, I, Sailor Moon,
will punish you in the name of the moon!

00:22.742 --> 00:28.374
Oh, man... We're studying for entrance
exams again at Rei's place today...

00:33.285 --> 00:34.479
I can't, I can't!

00:34.520 --> 00:36.420
I have to bear it until the
entrance exams are over!

00:36.455 --> 00:39.891
Everyone else is doing their best, too!

00:42.028 --> 00:42.858
What?!

00:51.170 --> 00:52.660
That's right!

00:52.705 --> 00:58.200
And Artemis didn't get the hint,
and ate another caramel!

00:59.678 --> 01:03.978
And of course, the caramel
got stuck onto his tooth...

01:04.016 --> 01:07.543
And because he's a cat, he couldn't pry
off the caramel stuck onto his tooth...

01:07.586 --> 01:12.216
...and he was squirming
around so much...

01:17.196 --> 01:19.289
Oh? Usagi...

01:19.331 --> 01:22.664
I was thinking everyone else was doing
their best, so I was keeping myself away...

01:22.701 --> 01:25.534
And yet you're here...

01:25.571 --> 01:28.631
No, I lured Minako in here.

01:28.674 --> 01:30.232
I asked her if she wanted to
come in every once in a while...

01:30.276 --> 01:31.834
...because she can get tired
from studying too much.

01:31.877 --> 01:35.643
Motoki! Don't you think you're
being a little easy on her?

01:35.681 --> 01:36.648
Uh, er, no...

01:36.682 --> 01:37.910
Usagi!

01:37.950 --> 01:39.941
We're only young once!

01:39.985 --> 01:42.715
What happens if we
fail our entrance exams?

01:42.755 --> 01:47.749
Won't you think, "Oh, I wish I had been
playing and having fun back then"?

01:47.793 --> 01:50.887
And they do say, "haste makes dancing."

01:51.897 --> 01:53.956
I think you should
be studying after all.

01:53.999 --> 01:57.526
If that's the case... Over here!

01:57.570 --> 02:00.903
I think you should
be studying after all...

02:05.411 --> 02:06.742
Go!

02:07.847 --> 02:10.372
I'm a lap behind!

02:10.416 --> 02:12.748
Seeya!

02:16.489 --> 02:17.854
Stay! Stay!

02:33.339 --> 02:34.806
I'm getting carsick...

02:34.840 --> 02:38.332
Come on now! Try again, Usagi!

02:38.377 --> 02:41.312
I think we should be going to
Rei's place soon, or otherwise...

02:41.347 --> 02:43.076
There's no time for that!

02:43.115 --> 02:47.575
If we stop now, who is going to conquer
the Formula 1 world in the future?

02:47.620 --> 02:49.520
I don't really want to conquer...

02:49.555 --> 02:51.045
Then, miss.

02:51.090 --> 02:53.456
Can I drive along side of you...?

03:08.140 --> 03:10.870
- You're...
- ...kidding.

03:17.183 --> 03:19.481
Oh, go right ahead!

03:19.518 --> 03:21.076
Can you hold my bag?

03:21.120 --> 03:25.147
Please, let her hold
as many as you want!

03:27.793 --> 03:28.691
I'm so lucky!

03:28.727 --> 03:33.255
It's not every day that such a hot
guy comes up and talks to you!

03:43.709 --> 03:47.270
So, how do ya like
my wonder fulsteering?

03:50.749 --> 03:53.343
Um... the race began already...

03:53.385 --> 03:54.511
I know...

03:54.820 --> 03:58.950
You see... I have to
give her a handicap...

04:00.426 --> 04:01.757
A handicap!?

04:01.794 --> 04:07.926
How dare he say that tome, Minako Aino,
who will conquer the Formula 1 world?!

04:09.568 --> 04:11.126
I think it's about time now...

04:23.215 --> 04:25.649
Impossible...
Exactly how fast is he going!?

04:27.519 --> 04:29.043
I see... amazing.

04:29.088 --> 04:29.918
Not even close...

04:41.533 --> 04:44.331
I'm a lap back?!

04:48.874 --> 04:50.341
Complete defeat.

04:50.609 --> 04:53.339
That's not true. You did pretty well.

04:53.379 --> 04:56.348
I guess cute girls have
good gaming sense as well...

04:56.882 --> 04:58.782
Really?

04:58.817 --> 05:02.617
Well... a lot of people say that to me...

05:02.655 --> 05:04.623
Sorry to keep you waiting, Haruka.

05:20.639 --> 05:22.129
You're kidding...

05:25.978 --> 05:27.138
Well, see you later.

05:28.013 --> 05:28.980
S-Sure.

05:29.014 --> 05:30.504
You with the buns...

05:30.549 --> 05:32.642
We should race together next time.

05:33.218 --> 05:34.947
Sure...

05:39.658 --> 05:41.626
You sure got to know them well...

05:41.660 --> 05:43.855
What... are you jealous?

05:45.064 --> 05:46.554
Maybe.

05:46.598 --> 05:51.126
They still seem so childish,
they're really cute...

05:53.505 --> 05:55.302
They're both so beautiful...

05:55.341 --> 05:58.367
So that man's name is Haruka...

05:58.410 --> 06:02.369
Come to think, I've been seeing
the two of them around here a lot...

06:02.414 --> 06:04.609
Oh, were you here, Motoki?

06:04.650 --> 06:08.142
Well, I DO work here...

06:17.763 --> 06:19.162
I feel it...

06:19.198 --> 06:22.497
The sea is about to be stormy again...

06:22.534 --> 06:25.230
We really have to be
careful in this town.

06:25.270 --> 06:27.431
Seems so...

06:28.073 --> 06:31.634
Minako, I think those two are lovers...

06:31.677 --> 06:32.939
I've made up my mind.

06:33.345 --> 06:38.078
He's the one! He's the ideal
man I've been looking for!

06:38.350 --> 06:40.011
W-Wait a minute, Minako!

06:40.052 --> 06:42.316
He already has a girlfriend, see!?

06:42.354 --> 06:45.221
But you didn't ask
those two that, did you!?

06:47.526 --> 06:50.723
I, Minako, will have my
heart burn with this romance!

06:50.763 --> 06:54.631
Miss, please return to your seat...

07:03.976 --> 07:06.376
They really are lovers after all...

07:06.412 --> 07:12.009
Usagi, you don't have to come with me
anymore. I'll do the rest myself.

07:12.050 --> 07:15.645
No way! I'm curious about
that handsome guy, too!

07:15.687 --> 07:18.247
But you have Mamoru, Usagi!

07:24.129 --> 07:26.495
See! They separated already!

07:26.532 --> 07:29.000
They weren't lovers at all!

07:37.276 --> 07:39.767
Mr. Kameda.

07:40.112 --> 07:41.272
Hello...

07:41.780 --> 07:43.475
Hey. You're here again?

07:43.515 --> 07:44.607
I'm sorry.

07:44.650 --> 07:47.676
Can you wait a while?
I'm almost done with this...

07:47.719 --> 07:48.515
Sure.

07:52.591 --> 07:54.582
Kaorinite...

07:54.893 --> 07:57.418
Yes, I am here.

07:57.663 --> 07:58.925
Did you find it?

07:59.298 --> 08:02.426
A human with the chosen pure heart.

08:02.768 --> 08:06.204
Yes... I have a good idea already.

08:06.238 --> 08:08.638
I see...

08:18.650 --> 08:20.379
Good, good...

08:20.419 --> 08:22.216
Good girl.

08:22.254 --> 08:24.745
Go, egg of Daimohn...

08:24.790 --> 08:28.282
Take a pure heart, and bring it to me!

08:54.820 --> 08:58.381
Now, you go ahead, and
hurry over to Rei's place!

08:58.423 --> 08:59.981
No! I don't want to!

09:00.025 --> 09:03.722
I'm curious about that
handsome guy as well!

09:34.259 --> 09:35.624
Little kittens...

09:35.661 --> 09:39.062
How long are you going to hide there?

09:39.097 --> 09:41.588
So you knew about us?

09:44.937 --> 09:46.404
Haruka Tenoh.

09:46.438 --> 09:47.598
Tenth grade.

09:48.707 --> 09:50.436
You wanted to know, right?

09:50.475 --> 09:53.035
About me...

09:53.211 --> 09:54.439
Yes!

09:54.479 --> 09:55.707
That's right!

09:55.747 --> 09:56.975
Right!

09:58.283 --> 10:01.480
The other things that you
have been wanting to know...

10:01.520 --> 10:02.612
Yes!

10:02.654 --> 10:05.919
The person who you were with until a few
minutes ago... how is she related to you?

10:05.958 --> 10:06.982
...to you?

10:08.160 --> 10:09.991
What kind of relationship do you have?

10:10.028 --> 10:10.995
...have?

10:11.029 --> 10:13.224
She's not your lover... right?

10:13.265 --> 10:14.254
Right?

10:14.566 --> 10:17.262
Lovers? Michiru and me?

10:17.302 --> 10:21.204
Michiru... so you guys are close
enough to not use honorifics?

10:21.239 --> 10:22.263
...not use them?

10:22.474 --> 10:27.002
Let's see... You could say
we're closer than that...

10:29.381 --> 10:32.009
But... don't give up.

10:32.451 --> 10:35.147
You two still have a chance...

10:35.187 --> 10:37.621
O-Okay...

10:38.190 --> 10:40.556
Don't be fooled...

10:40.592 --> 10:41.524
Michiru...

10:41.560 --> 10:45.519
This person always says things like
that when cute girls are spotted.

10:45.564 --> 10:47.532
Isn't that a little much to say?

10:47.566 --> 10:51.263
Oh, is it all right to say that to me?

10:51.303 --> 10:53.464
I'll just take what I
brought for you and go home.

10:53.505 --> 10:55.473
Come on...

10:55.807 --> 10:56.705
Question!

10:56.742 --> 10:59.267
Are you Haruka's lover?

10:59.311 --> 11:01.472
Please answer yes or no!

11:03.015 --> 11:04.209
No.

11:04.249 --> 11:05.307
All right!

11:05.350 --> 11:07.113
This romance is mine!

11:07.152 --> 11:08.176
It's mine!

11:08.220 --> 11:11.781
You have Mamoru, Usagi!

11:11.823 --> 11:15.782
Today's Minako is
snappier than usual...

11:15.827 --> 11:17.795
She's acting just like Rei.

11:19.297 --> 11:21.731
Oh, no.. I wonder if it's pollen...

11:21.767 --> 11:23.530
You have to be careful
during this season.

11:23.568 --> 11:27.004
In any case, Usagi and
Minako sure are late...

11:27.039 --> 11:29.200
What are both of them doing?

11:29.474 --> 11:32.170
I'm worried that it's BOTH of them...

11:32.577 --> 11:34.135
I wonder if something happened...

11:34.179 --> 11:36.579
In any case, knowing the two of them...

11:36.615 --> 11:40.745
Don't you think they probably
found a cute boy, and followed him?

11:40.786 --> 11:43.084
Impossible... even they...

11:49.528 --> 11:52.827
Mr. Kameda over there is
trying to become a mechanic...

11:52.864 --> 11:56.163
...who can tune up cars to
international racing standards...

11:56.201 --> 11:58.499
That's why I like coming here...

11:58.537 --> 12:04.635
I think I can see a racing circuit beyond
here, swaying in the haze from a mirage.

12:12.884 --> 12:16.012
The wind that blows across
a circuit carries a wonderful scent...

12:16.054 --> 12:18.181
Um... Haruka, you're...

12:18.223 --> 12:22.455
Haruka's dream is to become
the top race car driver...

12:22.494 --> 12:25.019
No... That's not true.

12:25.063 --> 12:26.724
It's not a dream...

12:26.765 --> 12:28.323
It WAS a dream...

12:28.366 --> 12:29.560
It WAS a dream?

12:29.601 --> 12:32.069
Then what is your dream now?

12:32.437 --> 12:35.770
To do something that only I can do.

12:35.807 --> 12:38.901
And to do that,
I will make any sacrifice...

12:38.944 --> 12:40.775
No matter what I lose...

12:40.812 --> 12:43.804
I won't regret it...

12:44.616 --> 12:46.846
He really is awesome...

12:46.885 --> 12:49.820
Yeah... He loses to
Mamo-chan, but still...

12:49.855 --> 12:52.449
All right!

12:52.657 --> 12:54.591
I think that about does it.

13:00.432 --> 13:01.421
What is it?

13:01.466 --> 13:02.262
Mr. Kameda!

13:04.636 --> 13:06.365
Haruka...

13:06.404 --> 13:07.496
I know...

13:23.522 --> 13:25.752
STEERINGOO!

13:25.791 --> 13:27.281
W-What is this?

13:27.692 --> 13:30.752
I'll take that pure heart
which rides on your dreams!

13:30.796 --> 13:34.095
JACK UP!

13:36.635 --> 13:37.363
HEY!

13:37.402 --> 13:39.131
Stop that!

13:55.587 --> 13:56.781
Stop it!

14:05.430 --> 14:10.527
I'll now have this crystal checked by
lady Kaorinite to see if it's a talisman.

14:20.679 --> 14:21.577
Oh, no!!

14:21.613 --> 14:25.549
We have to hurry and get
his heart's crystal back...

14:25.584 --> 14:27.245
Haruka!

14:28.587 --> 14:30.248
He's gone...

14:30.288 --> 14:34.691
Minako... it's not the time
to be saying such things...

14:34.726 --> 14:35.750
I know...

14:36.394 --> 14:38.862
VENUS STAR POWER...

14:38.897 --> 14:41.422
...MAKE UP!

15:02.587 --> 15:05.556
MOON COSMIC POWER...

15:05.590 --> 15:08.115
...MAKE UP!

15:54.172 --> 15:55.196
Let's go, Michiru!

15:55.240 --> 15:56.798
Fine!

16:02.280 --> 16:03.770
They're flying!?

16:06.851 --> 16:08.113
Look out!

16:10.588 --> 16:13.148
Kabooom!

16:13.191 --> 16:16.126
Kerpow!

16:19.064 --> 16:20.531
This is too dangerous...

16:20.565 --> 16:24.296
I'm glad I was wearing a helmet...

16:24.903 --> 16:26.734
We finally caught up to you!

16:26.771 --> 16:29.331
The pure heart of a man
chasing his dream!

16:29.374 --> 16:31.308
We won't let villains take it away!

16:33.144 --> 16:34.304
For love and justice...

16:34.346 --> 16:38.305
...the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!
Sailor Moon!

16:39.818 --> 16:43.549
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

16:43.722 --> 16:46.555
Wait a minute!
You made me pedal the bike!

16:46.591 --> 16:48.559
Don't look so cool all by yourself!.

16:49.461 --> 16:52.828
Today's Venus is snappier than usual...

16:53.832 --> 16:58.462
I will not allow any more traffic
obstructions to block my driving!

17:05.744 --> 17:06.904
Hold it!

17:07.245 --> 17:08.177
Who is it?

17:08.413 --> 17:11.678
Guided by a new era, Sailor Uranus...

17:11.716 --> 17:14.184
...acts with elegance!

17:14.219 --> 17:18.121
Also guided by a new era,
Sailor Neptune...

17:18.156 --> 17:20.181
...acts with grace!

17:20.992 --> 17:24.189
We have a reason to seek the talismans.

17:24.229 --> 17:26.527
We won't let you
have the heart's crystal!

17:26.865 --> 17:29.356
The mysterious soldiers...

17:29.401 --> 17:31.392
...were sailor soldiers?

17:31.436 --> 17:34.872
Are you trying to obstruct
my course as well!?

17:38.743 --> 17:40.734
WORLD...

17:40.779 --> 17:43.304
...SHAKING!

17:52.490 --> 17:55.015
DEEP...

17:55.060 --> 17:57.255
...SUBMERGE!

18:04.335 --> 18:06.496
Now's your chance, Sailor Moon!

18:06.538 --> 18:07.436
I got it!

18:27.459 --> 18:30.860
MOON SPIRAL...

18:31.563 --> 18:34.259
...HEART...

18:34.299 --> 18:36.790
...ATTACK!

18:44.676 --> 18:47.008
Lovely!

19:01.559 --> 19:03.959
No... this isn't a talisman either.

19:03.995 --> 19:06.429
Looks that way...

19:06.464 --> 19:07.522
Sailor Moon.

19:09.634 --> 19:13.331
Return that to its rightful owner.

19:21.212 --> 19:25.080
And so, that was the
last we saw of Haruka...

19:25.116 --> 19:28.347
So in other words both
of you really were...

19:28.386 --> 19:31.549
...ditching the study group
to chase a cute guy!?

19:32.690 --> 19:38.253
Everyone, we have to research the new
sailor soldiers before all of this.

19:38.296 --> 19:41.823
That's fine, Luna and Artemis
are doing the research right now.

19:41.866 --> 19:42.890
I see...

19:42.934 --> 19:45.494
That's why I didn't
see either of them...

19:45.537 --> 19:47.562
Oh...

19:47.605 --> 19:49.072
Michiru!

19:49.340 --> 19:52.210
Aren't you with Haruka today?

19:52.210 --> 19:53.802
I am.

19:53.845 --> 19:56.143
Where? Where is this cute guy? Where?

19:56.181 --> 19:58.843
Where? Where is the guy that looks
like the upperclassman we know?

19:59.918 --> 20:00.850
Where is he?

20:11.829 --> 20:13.421
A girl...

20:13.464 --> 20:14.362
...right?

20:16.935 --> 20:19.597
I don't recall ever
saying that I was a guy...

20:19.637 --> 20:22.435
That can't be...

20:23.775 --> 20:27.233
We don't have time for all of this...

20:27.278 --> 20:32.113
I thought Mamo-chan was better
from the beginning! Yeah, I did!

20:35.113 --> 20:39.113
