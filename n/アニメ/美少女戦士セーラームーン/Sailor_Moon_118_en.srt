1
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:05,013
Dobon, mahjong, and roll-of-the-dice.

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:09,216
Games are all fun,
but you shouldn't gamble!

3
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:13,352
Furthermore, to bet
people's lives is immoral!

4
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:17,591
If you're an ill-willed person
who wants to win by cheating...

5
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:20,528
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,864
This one...

7
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:31,699
I did it! I'm out!

8
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,869
It seems that the joker likes me.

9
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:38,005
The ace of hearts always
runs away from me...

10
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,813
Sheesh, Hotaru!

11
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:46,015
You're really good when it comes
to Memory! Don't say that!

12
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:48,285
All right!
We'll play Memory!

13
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:50,884
I won't lose this time!!

14
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:08,501
Finally, a Daimohn who's strong during
matches that really count will be born...

15
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:14,506
Oh, Professor?
It's almost time for tea!

16
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:15,616
Oh, that's right!

17
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:18,450
I'm in charge of getting
the snacks today, aren't I?

18
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:19,284
Yes!

19
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:22,382
Then, I'll go out to buy the snacks!

20
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,950
Be careful!

21
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:28,092
Sheesh, the professor is
too easy on things!

22
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:31,157
If you want to make it stronger, you have
to really get down and do it like this!

23
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:34,936
When it fails, I'm always the one
who takes responsibility for it...

24
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,997
So I want him to at least do this much!

25
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,710
T-This might not be so good...!?

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,116
I-I don't know anything about this!!

27
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:55,281
W-What...!?

28
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,367
Are you all right, Chibiusa?

29
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:14,341
Yeah...

30
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:16,641
I'm glad...

31
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:20,640
What's this!?

32
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,415
What IS this!?

33
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:29,046
Hotaru...

34
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:31,060
Hotaru...?

35
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,303
It looks like something really
out of the ordinary happened...

36
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:42,963
I know!

37
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:48,276
Everyone! Help me!

38
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,278
Huh? What's wrong, Chibiusa?

39
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:55,540
I don't know what's going on,
but Hotaru's house is in danger!

40
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,018
What's wrong, Hotaru!?

41
00:02:58,054 --> 00:02:59,521
What in the world was that...?

42
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,318
In any case, we should head over!

43
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:02,255
Yeah...

44
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:04,258
Hotaru?

45
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:07,057
In my dresser...

46
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:10,259
...there are fish swimming...

47
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:14,495
Oh, no...

48
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:15,799
Then, the rest of the house...?

49
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,024
What should we do?

50
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:40,361
Hotaru!

51
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:44,533
I'm sure help is on the way,
so let's do our best until then!

52
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:46,991
Yeah...

53
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:52,198
Oh, boy, it looks like I'm a little late.

54
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,008
To think someone would
pull a prank on me...!!

55
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:58,980
Open up, you fool!

56
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:02,542
I am the master of the house!

57
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:08,121
I see! So that's how you
want to play it! Then, I'll...

58
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,516
It's here!

59
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,083
What in the world happened!?

60
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:15,063
It looks like this house got connected to an
alternate dimension due to some strong force.

61
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:20,430
You are...!?

62
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:22,031
Can it be...?

63
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:24,232
Have they realized who I really am...!?

64
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:28,066
Don't worry, Hotaru's dad!

65
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:30,238
We're not suspicious people!

66
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:32,173
A necessity for times in need!

67
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,240
Pretty soldiers with the Sailor emblem!

68
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:37,242
If you don't know us, we'll punish you!

69
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:42,047
What are you doing in
someone else's front yard!?

70
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:43,251
So embarrassing!

71
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:46,523
That's so cruel!
You didn't have to really hit me!!

72
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:49,360
It's all your fault for doing
something you didn't need to do!

73
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:50,057
What!?

74
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,431
- I must've over estimated them.
- It's something I have to do! I can't help it!

75
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:54,026
You'll rescue Hotaru...?

76
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:57,295
Yes! Leave it to us!

77
00:04:57,406 --> 00:05:00,034
Now, let's hurry, Sailor Moon!

78
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:05,809
The house will be sucked into this alternate
dimension and disappear in just one hour!

79
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:09,079
Such a hard turn of events all of a sudden...!

80
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:15,981
I'm hot...!

81
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,585
Water...

82
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:20,921
I'm cold!!

83
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:23,989
Sheesh! What's up with all of this!!

84
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:29,060
All right, I'm leaving it up to you, Jupiter!

85
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:30,732
Wait a minute!

86
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,774
What are you planning to do, Sailor Moon?

87
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,174
What am I...?

88
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,873
Well, Jupiter first uses
the Wide Pressure, right?

89
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:41,873
Then, if that doesn't work, Mars can burn
the door down with Burning Mandala...

90
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,887
And, what are you going to do?

91
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,481
Me...?Just watch...

92
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:48,854
Just kidding!

93
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,985
Can I really trust all of you...?

94
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:53,757
Of course!

95
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:57,288
The only big fool who doesn't
understand the situation is this one girl!

96
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,233
What did you say!?

97
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:02,635
Anyway, if you try to forcefully
break open that door...

98
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:05,368
...the time-space balance will be broken,
and the entire house will...

99
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,501
- ...be sucked into the alternate dimension!
- See, did you hear that!?

100
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:10,068
You always end up being embarrassed
because you don't listen to what others say!

101
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:11,010
In any case!

102
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:15,848
We should go inside,
and open the door from the inside.

103
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:17,580
Um... and...

104
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,054
How are we going to go inside...?

105
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,354
Oh, come on! The only thing we
can do is the Sailor Teleport!

106
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:24,825
- Oh, brother...
- All right!

107
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,488
Then, let's go, guys!

108
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,998
Yeah, yeah... Fine, just fine!

109
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:38,036
SAILOR TELEPORT!

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,194
What!?

111
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,663
Did we make a mistake
in where we ended up!?

112
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:12,537
No!

113
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:15,703
This is inside Hotaru's house!

114
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:21,306
How ironic that I have to
rely on the Sailor Soldiers...

115
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,681
But...

116
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:26,176
I can't afford to lose Hotaru now...

117
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,783
Oh, I had forgotten...

118
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,952
I guess I'll have this tea while I wait.

119
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:37,393
Sheesh! Why is this place Hotaru's house!?

120
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:41,631
As I said, it's just that various pieces of
time and space are twisted together here!

121
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:47,735
The scenery keeps changing, but we haven't
moved one bit out of Hotaru's house!

122
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,779
So, Chibiusa and Hotaru
can't be too far away, either!

123
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,787
I'm getting dizzy.

124
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,822
It's been 20 minutes already...

125
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,790
I wonder if everyone is all right...

126
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:05,059
Hey.

127
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,291
How are things...?

128
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,399
Hotaru Tomoe seems to be
trapped in an alternate dimension...

129
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:17,805
In the worst case, Sailor Moon and her
gang might not be able to return as well...

130
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:20,540
It would be better if they
Just didn't come back.

131
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:22,134
Haruka!

132
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:24,203
I can't help it!

133
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:27,181
Hotaru Tomoe is a dangerous existence...

134
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,984
Everyone... hurry up and get here...

135
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,921
Chibiusa!

136
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:35,218
Are you all right...?

137
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:38,988
I'm fine, I'm all right! If
I exercise just a little bit...

138
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:41,292
It's safer if you didn't
move around too much!

139
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,560
I'm fine, it's nothing...

140
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:47,660
Chibiusa!

141
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,339
Hotaru!

142
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:55,810
Chibiusa!

143
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:21,929
Hotaru! That's enough!
You can let go of me!

144
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,100
No...!

145
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:26,403
Hotaru!

146
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:30,740
They're inside the next
dimension that we'll be entering!

147
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,374
Really...!?

148
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,541
No mistakes there!

149
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:34,674
It's going to shift...

150
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:37,618
One, two... three!

151
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:46,123
There they are!

152
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:47,151
Oh, no!!

153
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:55,393
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

154
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:58,671
Venus!

155
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:00,834
Hurry! We have to pull them up!
Help me!

156
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:10,982
It's impossible to use the Sailor Teleport
if we have to take both Hotaru and Chibiusa.

157
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,647
Then, how are we...?

158
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:15,179
Can you save one of us, at least...?

159
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:18,593
If that's the case... please save Chibiusa!

160
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:20,686
I'll stay here...!!

161
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,463
Hotaru...!?

162
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:25,229
Please don't mind me...

163
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:29,363
I'm someone who should have
never been born, anyway...

164
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:33,034
Please! Save Chibiusa!

165
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,936
Hotaru.

166
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:37,572
It's all right!

167
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:40,241
We'll rescue both of you!

168
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:42,443
You're Chibiusa's friend, right?

169
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:46,115
If you say stuff like that,
Chibiusa will be sad!

170
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:50,387
I'm sure this young lady here will
find a way for all of us to go back!

171
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:54,453
Chibiusa's friend is our friend...

172
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:58,130
Let's all go back together.

173
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:00,196
Okay...

174
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:03,694
Sheesh...
They only have 30 minutes left...

175
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,567
We'll be connected to the exit!

176
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:18,543
Everyone... are you all right!?

177
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:20,316
Yeah...

178
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:22,324
I can't take this anymore!

179
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,293
Can we really get out of here...!?

180
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:27,557
We have the highest possibility here.

181
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:29,757
I have a bad feeling about this...

182
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:34,925
Just as I thought.

183
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:38,038
Welcome...

184
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:43,241
Welcome here!

185
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:51,015
I'm a strange Daimohn who lives
in this strange world, Ikasaman!

186
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:54,750
The energy for this alternate
dimension is all coming from her!!

187
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,024
That's correct...
I hope you enjoyed your epic adventure.

188
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:00,955
That means...

189
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:04,022
We can't get out of here
unless we defeat that thing!?

190
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,397
Hold on a moment!

191
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:07,935
I don't like violence...

192
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,871
I'm a pacifist, though I'm a villain.

193
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,731
What kind of villain is that!?

194
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,868
Well, you know...

195
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,344
I love to gamble.

196
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:22,874
If you play a game with me and you win,
I'll let you go back to your own world...

197
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:24,915
We don't have time for that!

198
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:26,922
BURNING--

199
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,415
Then...!

200
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:32,918
I guess I'll have you go to
some strange place again!

201
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,027
Fine!

202
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:38,932
But if even one person wins,
I want you to take us back to our world!

203
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:40,630
Nice!

204
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:42,864
I don't care what game we play!

205
00:12:42,905 --> 00:12:47,433
But, if I win... I'll have you as my
gaming partners for eternity!

206
00:12:48,444 --> 00:12:50,969
Now, let's begin!

207
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:54,746
All right! I'll go first against you!

208
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,239
A challenge!

209
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,181
Red... 16!

210
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,797
- You lose!
- You're a cheater!

211
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,001
There!

212
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:17,801
Now, it's your turn, right?

213
00:13:25,547 --> 00:13:27,981
You lose!

214
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:31,911
Checkmate!

215
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,114
I win!

216
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,350
Oh! That square...

217
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:42,597
There! You lose!

218
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:45,324
Who's up next?

219
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:47,568
We are!

220
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:55,173
I'll show you that it's not for nothing that
I've been going to the arcades so much!

221
00:13:57,146 --> 00:13:59,171
Bring it on!

222
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:06,221
You have to read the
directions well first, you know!

223
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:09,986
It's not always the case that
the car will move forward!

224
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:11,686
That's... impossible...!!

225
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:15,353
Was that all...?

226
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,490
Hold on just a minute!

227
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,933
We'll challenge you!

228
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:22,200
Chibiusa!

229
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,430
Okay...
What game will you like?

230
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,933
Old Maid!

231
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:30,440
Okay!

232
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:35,943
A challenge!

233
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,046
What is everyone doing...?

234
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:40,953
They have less than 1 0 minutes left...!

235
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,949
Now, it's your turn!

236
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,685
Then, I'll take a card!

237
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:48,390
Is it this one?

238
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:52,629
She's a child after all...
I can tell just by looking at her face...!

239
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:55,302
Or is it this one...?

240
00:14:55,738 --> 00:14:57,865
Justas I thought! This one!

241
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,999
T-This is...!!

242
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,135
Hah! You fell for it!

243
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:04,270
Dammit! How dare you!?

244
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,581
I've been waiting for you to take that!

245
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,314
Really?

246
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,288
Oh, I'm so glad!

247
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:17,385
- If you're told that, you usually...
- Here, it's your turn, Chibiusa.

248
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:19,417
- ...would think that it was a joker!
- I did it! A match!

249
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,622
Here!

250
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:23,392
I did it! I win!

251
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:26,033
- You did it!
- Chibiusa!

252
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:29,663
Now, you promised!
Take us back to our world!

253
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:30,501
Not yet!

254
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:34,770
I won't let you go until SHE wins!

255
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,175
That can't be...

256
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:38,179
If you don't like it,
I won't let you through!

257
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:41,208
Well, you don't even have 5 minutes left...!

258
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,239
Fine!

259
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:46,846
Hotaru, stare at her face,
and decide which card you want to pick!

260
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:50,420
One is the joker,
and the other is the ace of hearts!

261
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,120
Ace of hearts...

262
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:57,126
I must make her pick the joker
at any cost... All right!

263
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:01,933
Now, even I don't know
which one the joker is!

264
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,030
Think hard, and flip over one card...

265
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,672
This will decide everyone's fate...

266
00:16:11,914 --> 00:16:13,006
During that last moment...

267
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:16,575
...I put a small mark on the joker so
I would know which is which!

268
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:18,848
I can work on her for a bit...

269
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:23,324
...and since she's such an honest girl,
she'll pick the card that I want her to pick!

270
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:29,754
Oh? Do you really want to pick that card?

271
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:38,166
That's right, I think that's the better choice!

272
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,140
Hotaru!

273
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:41,771
It doesn't matter which!

274
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,937
Pick the one that you like!

275
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:46,846
Don't worry about which one!
Just let yourself go and pick one!

276
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,179
You'll do all right!

277
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:51,152
We all believe in you!

278
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,351
Why...?

279
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,323
Because we all like you so much!

280
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:03,064
Hotaru!
Just think of this as a game of Memory!

281
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:15,076
You did it, Hotaru!

282
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,635
Chibiusa...

283
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:19,439
Hotaru!

284
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:22,206
It's all right, she just passed out.

285
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,445
Now, you promised!

286
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:26,320
Take us back!

287
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:28,690
I forgot whether or not
I ever made that promise!

288
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:29,884
What did you say!?

289
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,552
You're so unfair!

290
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,528
Say what ever you like!

291
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,763
I can't forgive you any longer!

292
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:43,728
MOON PRISM POWER...

293
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,172
MAKE UP!

294
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:53,311
PINK SUGAR...

295
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:55,509
...HEART...

296
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,778
...ATTACK!

297
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,155
That's funny...

298
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:05,887
I really had my heart set on it today...

299
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:12,133
That was dangerous!

300
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,725
But... you were able to get out!

301
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:15,396
Oh, you're right!

302
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:18,402
CRISIS...

303
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,840
MAKE UP!

304
00:18:48,637 --> 00:18:52,471
RAINBOW...

305
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,872
...MOON...

306
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:57,072
...HEART ACHE!

307
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:05,511
I'm against violence!

308
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,986
Love-lovely!!

309
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:26,868
We're back!

310
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:29,206
You did it, Sailor Moon!

311
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,038
Hotaru!

312
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:34,844
Wait a minute!

313
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:38,080
It would be bad to stay in that outfit!

314
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,055
Oh, I get it...

315
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,715
Hotaru... Thank you!

316
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:52,058
Hotaru...!

317
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,226
Thank you...

318
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:55,099
I don't know how I can thank you...!

319
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:07,106
Someday, you'll regret that you
ever saved her, Sailor Soldiers...

320
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:10,247
It was too bad, Haruka.

321
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:16,554
Setsuna, Haruka believes in
Sailor Moon more than either of us.

322
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,219
Who ever said that?

323
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:23,292
We did it, Chibiusa, Hotaru!

324
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:24,662
Yeah...!

325
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:28,897
We really are the ultimate duo, Hotaru!

326
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,897
