WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.333
The Messiah of Silence finally awakens!

00:05.370 --> 00:10.273
Is defeating Hotaru the only way
to save humans from annihilation!?

00:10.609 --> 00:12.975
No! I won't let that happen!

00:13.011 --> 00:19.712
There has to be some way for everyone
to be happy without anyone getting hurt!!

00:34.000 --> 00:36.662
Come, students.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.434
To Mugen Academy.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.668
Into our hands.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.387
The winds are crying.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.891
This planet is cowering at
the horrors of the unknown as well...

01:14.074 --> 01:15.336
Chibiusa...

01:19.179 --> 01:20.908
Hotaru...

01:21.281 --> 01:22.908
Where did you go...?

01:31.291 --> 01:33.452
Chibiusa...

01:33.493 --> 01:34.585
Chibiusa.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.061
You know, about Hotaru...

01:36.096 --> 01:37.085
I'm sure she's all right--

01:37.130 --> 01:38.495
Usagi!!

01:44.037 --> 01:44.799
Usagi...

01:44.838 --> 01:47.272
Oh, sorry.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.374
I'll get you back!

01:50.410 --> 01:51.638
How dare you!?

01:51.678 --> 01:52.906
Fine!

01:52.946 --> 01:54.914
I give up! I give up!

01:54.948 --> 01:56.040
I won!

01:56.082 --> 01:57.743
Here, take your towel.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.716
Good night!

01:58.752 --> 02:00.185
Don't catch a cold!

02:00.220 --> 02:00.914
Yeah!

02:01.721 --> 02:02.915
Hey, Usagi!

02:04.391 --> 02:05.790
You know...

02:05.825 --> 02:08.919
I'm worried about Hotaru,
but I'll cheer up.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.919
Chibiusa...

02:11.464 --> 02:12.692
Thanks!

02:12.732 --> 02:13.926
Good night!

02:14.768 --> 02:16.326
Good night...

02:16.369 --> 02:18.803
Usagi.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.370
The students of Mugen Academy
are gathering on campus.

02:24.411 --> 02:25.935
It looks like something
is going to happen.

02:28.348 --> 02:31.283
Chibiusa, I'm going to
go without telling you.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.947
I'll make sure to bring Hotaru
back safe and sound.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.687
Chibiusa...

02:44.731 --> 02:45.925
This isn't good...

02:45.966 --> 02:48.434
Hotaru's body is starting to weaken rapidly.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.959
We urgently need pure hearts.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.332
I have already finished the preparations.

02:54.374 --> 02:58.140
I, Cyprin, the last and
greatest witch of the Witches 5...

02:58.178 --> 03:00.738
...will do my best for you, Professor.

03:01.314 --> 03:04.147
I'm counting on you, Cyprin.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.846
Now, the only one I can rely on is you.

03:06.886 --> 03:08.285
Leave it to me.

03:08.321 --> 03:12.018
I am quite different from Kaorinite...

03:12.525 --> 03:14.755
Do your best.

03:15.095 --> 03:18.087
Professor... you're saying
the same thing to Cyprin...

03:18.131 --> 03:19.257
Dammit, Cyprin...

03:27.507 --> 03:31.944
F-Fine! I will get a hold of
the best pure heart there is!

03:31.978 --> 03:33.775
Just you watch, Cyprin...

03:34.347 --> 03:36.611
The best pure heart there is...

03:36.649 --> 03:40.779
The target is that girl who Hotaru
has opened up to the most.

03:41.421 --> 03:45.118
The heart of that girl named Chibiusa.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.545
Chibiusa, help me!

04:10.817 --> 04:11.806
Hotaru!

04:17.457 --> 04:19.789
Hotaru!!

04:22.529 --> 04:24.997
Hotaru...

04:31.638 --> 04:35.472
The superior students of Mugen Academy...

04:35.909 --> 04:37.843
Now is the time...

04:37.877 --> 04:43.338
...to sacrifice your pure hearts
to us, the Death Busters.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.583
The time has come.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.583
Sacrifice your pure hearts...

04:51.624 --> 04:54.889
...to the grand Death Busters.

04:57.997 --> 05:01.455
That's right... your pure hearts.

05:07.340 --> 05:12.437
Young ladies, outsiders are not
allowed to come onto school grounds!!

05:15.515 --> 05:19.281
Then everyone,
please submit your pure hearts.

05:19.886 --> 05:23.151
I have to get rid of those pests.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.088
Upstairs...?

05:26.126 --> 05:27.718
Yes...

05:33.666 --> 05:34.428
This is...!?

05:34.467 --> 05:37.561
Welcome, Sailor Soldiers.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.003
Nice to meet you.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.441
I'm Cyprin, the last and
greatest witch of the Witches 5.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.936
I guess there's no need
to hide our identities.

05:47.981 --> 05:48.948
Everyone, time to transform!

05:49.916 --> 05:52.680
VENUS STAR POWER...

05:57.090 --> 06:00.025
MERCURY STAR POWER...

06:04.497 --> 06:07.295
MARS STAR POWER...

06:12.639 --> 06:15.574
JUPITER STAR POWER...

06:21.915 --> 06:24.816
MOON COSMIC POWER...

06:28.621 --> 06:30.953
MAKE UP!

06:43.303 --> 06:47.296
I will save this planet
with love and beauty!

06:54.414 --> 06:58.942
I won't allow evil silence!
Take a cold shower and repent!

07:06.926 --> 07:09.224
Those who tarnish pure hearts...

07:09.262 --> 07:13.164
In the name of Mars,
I will chastise you!

07:20.139 --> 07:22.699
I won't let you have
whatever you want!

07:22.742 --> 07:26.542
I'll shock you so
much you'll regret it!

07:49.469 --> 07:55.430
We, the sailor team,
will punish you in the name of the moon!

07:57.410 --> 08:00.004
Soon, this planet will be
surrounded by silence.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.071
We, the Death Busters, are victorious.

08:03.483 --> 08:07.920
BURNING...

08:09.088 --> 08:11.556
...MANDALA!

08:18.364 --> 08:19.991
Did I get her?

08:21.401 --> 08:22.925
Sailor Mars!

08:31.144 --> 08:33.078
Sailor Mars!

08:33.112 --> 08:36.081
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

08:37.684 --> 08:38.673
I won't let you escape now!

08:39.419 --> 08:40.909
You think you captured me with this?

08:40.953 --> 08:42.181
What'd you--!

08:51.397 --> 08:52.557
I'm Cyprin.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.964
And I'm Petirol.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.529
Two together to make one.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.970
The one, and the same.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.197
It doesn't matter if it's one or two!

09:02.241 --> 09:03.208
Take this!

09:03.242 --> 09:05.972
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

09:06.446 --> 09:06.935
Petirol!

09:06.979 --> 09:08.105
Cyprin!

09:08.948 --> 09:10.040
Such a thing...

09:10.083 --> 09:11.710
...has no effect...

09:11.751 --> 09:13.685
...on us!!

09:14.053 --> 09:15.111
Jupiter!

09:20.259 --> 09:22.420
Oh, you just run around?

09:22.462 --> 09:25.158
Sailor Soldiers really
aren't much, are they?

09:56.829 --> 09:58.228
Hotaru...

09:58.264 --> 10:01.631
Just you wait,
I'll make sure to save you.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.296
MOON PRISM POWER...

10:04.337 --> 10:06.669
MAKE UP!

10:12.545 --> 10:14.638
I see... that brat is also a Sailor Soldier...

10:15.581 --> 10:18.209
An unexpected harvest.

10:31.864 --> 10:33.456
I'm not scared, I'm not scared...

10:33.499 --> 10:35.160
Please wait for me, Hotaru...

10:45.778 --> 10:48.076
Hotaru?

10:48.815 --> 10:52.114
Hotaru wants to see you, too.

10:53.085 --> 10:58.182
Hotaru wants to see you
and have your pure heart.

10:59.892 --> 11:01.826
Tuxedo Mask!

11:01.861 --> 11:04.091
The feelings of a girl for her friend.

11:04.130 --> 11:09.090
A pathetic soldier with a heart
so frozen to not feel that warmth.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.198
Take that!

11:16.242 --> 11:17.470
Sailor Chibi Moon!

11:22.982 --> 11:25.576
DEAD SCREAM...

11:29.222 --> 11:31.213
Chibi Moon!

11:33.292 --> 11:34.486
Oh, no!

11:36.696 --> 11:39.529
It's mine... the best pure heart there is...

11:39.565 --> 11:42.090
Sailor Chibi Moon...

11:46.072 --> 11:47.937
SHINE AQUA...

11:47.974 --> 11:49.202
...ILLUSION!

11:58.284 --> 11:59.216
T-They're strong...

11:59.252 --> 12:00.981
W-We have to do something...

12:01.020 --> 12:03.454
Their teamwork is just too good.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.719
If there is a way to separate those two...

12:05.758 --> 12:07.316
Playtime is now over...

12:07.360 --> 12:09.453
We'll be attacking for real now.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.463
If you get hit with
the next one, you'll die!

12:11.764 --> 12:13.857
We have to take a risk now!

12:13.900 --> 12:14.924
All right!

12:14.967 --> 12:16.025
Here we go!

12:16.068 --> 12:17.763
Let's show them...

12:17.803 --> 12:18.861
...our teamwork!

12:18.905 --> 12:21.305
BUBBLE...

12:24.210 --> 12:26.610
...SPRAY!

12:29.148 --> 12:31.116
Blocking our vision?
How useless!

12:31.150 --> 12:33.641
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

12:33.686 --> 12:34.277
Petirol!

12:34.320 --> 12:34.979
Cyprin!

12:36.822 --> 12:39.290
MOON TIARA ACTION!

12:39.692 --> 12:42.160
FIRE SOUL!

12:42.194 --> 12:45.254
Your attacks do nothing against us!

12:45.298 --> 12:48.859
We just absorb all that power,
and it just increases OUR power!

12:48.901 --> 12:49.765
There!

12:50.236 --> 12:51.168
Cyprin!

12:51.203 --> 12:51.931
D-Damn you!!

12:51.971 --> 12:54.235
Cyprin! Don't chase after them!

12:54.774 --> 12:55.468
There!

12:57.510 --> 12:59.239
Dammit!

13:02.648 --> 13:04.240
I'm not letting you get away!

13:05.985 --> 13:07.247
I won't let you escape!

13:08.821 --> 13:09.981
Fool!

13:22.201 --> 13:23.498
What!?

13:23.769 --> 13:24.463
Cyprin!

13:24.503 --> 13:25.299
Petirol!

13:42.488 --> 13:43.682
We did it!

13:43.723 --> 13:44.781
That was a tough opponent!

13:49.195 --> 13:50.787
It's back to normal!

13:52.465 --> 13:53.796
Look!

13:55.201 --> 13:57.795
What in the world is this corridor!?

13:59.905 --> 14:03.534
I sense a distortion
in space from this corridor.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.477
It's connected to another dimension.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.772
The headquarters
of the Death Busters!?

14:09.815 --> 14:10.804
Let's go!

14:33.072 --> 14:37.509
Welcome, young Sailor Soldiers.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.505
So you finally showed up.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.377
You are very lucky.

14:43.416 --> 14:47.512
You get to participate in the
ceremony that is about to begin...

14:51.390 --> 14:53.358
Sailor Chibi Moon!

14:59.231 --> 15:00.255
Uranus!

15:00.700 --> 15:03.225
Dammit!
He's got a strong barrier set up...

15:03.269 --> 15:04.099
Uranus!

15:04.136 --> 15:05.262
Neptune!

15:06.205 --> 15:08.605
It seems as though
you all made it on time.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.268
You are...?

15:10.776 --> 15:12.266
Sailor Chibi Moon!!

15:13.946 --> 15:15.379
Kaorinite.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.608
Yes.

15:16.649 --> 15:20.016
Soon, the Messiah of Silence will awaken.

15:20.052 --> 15:24.887
Using the pure heart of this girl
named Chibiusa as her energy.

15:25.324 --> 15:28.054
The pure heart...

15:28.461 --> 15:29.928
Chibiusa!!

15:29.962 --> 15:31.122
Stop it!

15:35.434 --> 15:37.834
Sailor Moon!

15:55.254 --> 15:58.314
The Messiah of Silence!!

15:58.724 --> 15:59.850
No! Stop it!

15:59.892 --> 16:01.792
Chibi Moon!

16:01.961 --> 16:02.791
Chibi Moon!

16:19.945 --> 16:23.642
H-Hotaru... I'm glad you're okay...

16:25.451 --> 16:29.080
This... is horrible!

16:29.121 --> 16:31.715
This is too horrible!!

16:32.024 --> 16:33.685
Beautiful.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.719
A pure heart fit for
the Messiah of Silence.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.529
This is no good!

16:39.565 --> 16:42.728
If Sailor Saturn revives,
this world will be destroyed!

16:45.938 --> 16:48.463
Hotaru! Stop!!

16:48.507 --> 16:51.999
Please! Stop her!
If you're Hotaru's dad...

16:52.044 --> 16:54.945
...if you love Hotaru...

16:54.980 --> 16:56.914
Please!

16:56.949 --> 16:58.883
Love?

16:58.918 --> 17:00.818
What do you mean?

17:14.767 --> 17:15.995
Could it be...?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.162
That's not Sailor Saturn!

17:18.571 --> 17:19.697
What did you say!?

17:20.239 --> 17:24.801
I am the Messiah of Silence...
Mistress Nine.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.841
W-What's going on!?

17:31.884 --> 17:34.785
She's not Sailor Saturn...!?

17:34.820 --> 17:36.549
It's the Death Busters!

17:36.589 --> 17:41.720
Hotaru was already possessed by
a powerful enemy, and it has awakened!

17:43.495 --> 17:45.326
It is our victory, Professor!

17:45.364 --> 17:49.061
Sorry to have troubled you, Kaorinite.

17:49.101 --> 17:52.537
That thought is the greatest
reward for me, Professor!

17:52.571 --> 17:53.970
I--!

18:00.613 --> 18:02.740
Kaorinite's job is now over.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.710
We will now start preparing
for the next step.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.617
Yes!!

18:12.458 --> 18:14.289
Chibiusa!!

18:14.326 --> 18:15.258
Hurry!

18:15.294 --> 18:16.761
This dimension will disappear soon!!

18:31.577 --> 18:32.771
W-What in the world is this!?

18:33.445 --> 18:35.777
Usagi's group is still inside...

18:38.450 --> 18:39.815
Sailor Moon...!

18:40.552 --> 18:42.281
Chibiusa!?

18:42.855 --> 18:43.822
Mamo-chan!

18:43.856 --> 18:46.848
Chibiusa...
Chibiusa isn't breathing!!

18:46.892 --> 18:47.654
What?!

18:48.260 --> 18:49.659
Small Lady!?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.829
There were students inside the building!

18:53.866 --> 18:55.595
Don't worry, we evacuated them already.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.659
Hurry!

19:04.944 --> 19:08.072
We linked Mamoru and Chibiusa's bodies.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.673
We'll keep Chibiusa alive
using Mamoru's life force.

19:11.050 --> 19:14.918
This is the best that
we can do for now.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.256
What have we been
fighting for all along?

19:18.290 --> 19:20.690
Getting Chibiusa into a mess like this...

19:21.827 --> 19:23.192
Setsuna!

19:23.362 --> 19:27.731
I will head towards Mugen
Academy with Uranus' group.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.098
To defeat the Messiah of Silence.

19:30.135 --> 19:31.625
Are you still saying that!?

19:31.670 --> 19:34.901
The Messiah of Silence is Hotaru!!

19:34.940 --> 19:38.774
There is no other way
to save Small Lady.

19:39.745 --> 19:44.011
No way... I don't want any
more people to be unhappy.

19:44.049 --> 19:47.485
Hotaru, Chibiusa... everyone else.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.680
I don't want to see anyone else's tears!!

19:49.722 --> 19:51.986
Usako...

19:56.628 --> 19:59.756
We have to do whatever we can do.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.728
We need to fight.

20:03.769 --> 20:07.762
Fight for the things that we believe in...

20:10.762 --> 20:14.762
