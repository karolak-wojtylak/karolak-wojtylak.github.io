WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:02.460
Come on, Chibiusa!

00:02.501 --> 00:06.767
If you're going to be coming
by again, tell me in advance!

00:06.805 --> 00:10.866
Even without you,
we're REALLY busy because...

00:10.909 --> 00:13.377
...we have new enemies and
mysterious soldiers!

00:13.412 --> 00:16.939
I'm fine with having Sailor Chibi Moon
around, but if you trouble the others...

00:16.982 --> 00:19.815
...I'll punish you in
the name of the moon!

00:20.400 --> 00:24.234
I, Chibiusa, also known
as Small Lady, have...

00:24.271 --> 00:28.071
...returned to the 20th
century for some training.

00:28.108 --> 00:31.976
I hope you guys will be nice to me!

00:42.156 --> 00:45.751
Returning here...
Who decided on that?

00:45.793 --> 00:48.762
Oh, that's right...
I have a letter from Mom.

00:48.796 --> 00:50.730
A letter? Let me see...

00:51.165 --> 00:52.530
Can you read it for me, Minako?

00:52.566 --> 00:55.000
Oh, sure.

00:55.502 --> 00:57.834
- Wait a minute!
- Okay, I'll read it.

00:57.871 --> 01:01.307
"It seems that you are able
to train our Small Lady."

01:01.341 --> 01:03.866
"Oh, my, how can I thank you!"

01:03.911 --> 01:07.847
"Thanks, and I trust
you with my daughter."

01:07.881 --> 01:09.508
...so it says.

01:09.716 --> 01:11.616
What, that's it!?

01:11.652 --> 01:16.055
Neo Queen Serenity really
is Usagi in a way...

01:16.089 --> 01:16.953
Yeah, yeah.

01:16.990 --> 01:18.821
What do you mean by that...?

01:18.859 --> 01:22.090
I know what you mean, Luna.
Because this letter...

01:22.129 --> 01:25.155
...has no kanji in it!

01:25.399 --> 01:26.798
Oh, my god, you're right!

01:26.834 --> 01:27.425
See?

01:27.467 --> 01:29.628
There are traces of where she erased
kanji that she made mistakes on...

01:29.670 --> 01:30.796
Why doesn't she check
with a dictionary?

01:30.838 --> 01:33.033
I'm sure because that's too tedious.

01:33.073 --> 01:36.304
It really IS Usagi in that way...

01:36.343 --> 01:40.780
Um... If we have time for that, we
should worry about Chibiusa now, right?

01:41.248 --> 01:43.978
But training? What in the
world will she be doing?

01:44.017 --> 01:46.315
If she's getting training
to be a real princess...

01:46.353 --> 01:48.617
...she doesn't really have
to come over to this era.

01:49.022 --> 01:51.718
I just hope Usagi's clumsiness
doesn't rub off onto her...

01:51.758 --> 01:53.521
Really... That's what
I'm worried about...

01:53.560 --> 01:54.959
Mars from the future said that too!

01:54.995 --> 01:58.761
She also told me many stories
about Usagi's stupidity.

01:58.799 --> 02:01.529
REI! What did you tell Chibiusa!?

02:01.568 --> 02:02.398
I don't know.

02:02.436 --> 02:04.597
The one that talked to her
was Mars-from-the-future.

02:04.638 --> 02:07.300
S-S-Same difference!
You were badmouthing about me!

02:07.341 --> 02:10.902
Don't worry. I'm not going to be
clumsy and make mistakes like Usagi.

02:11.345 --> 02:14.542
We'll help out in whatever way
we can, so feel free to ask us.

02:14.581 --> 02:15.673
Thanks.

02:15.716 --> 02:18.310
Well, I'm going to go train now!

02:21.722 --> 02:24.748
There's something else in here.

02:24.791 --> 02:27.919
"P.S. Usagi in the 20th century--"

02:28.795 --> 02:32.094
"Studying while young
really was important."

02:32.132 --> 02:36.159
"Make sure you do it well," she wrote.

02:36.837 --> 02:38.600
She really IS Usagi after all...

02:38.639 --> 02:41.665
I don't want to study!!

02:41.708 --> 02:45.166
The 20th century is a great place
after all... I can relax so much here!

02:46.546 --> 02:50.880
Small Lady, you have to learn
something in the 20th century.

02:50.918 --> 02:53.318
That is how to make friends.

02:53.353 --> 02:54.650
Friends?

02:54.688 --> 02:55.985
Yes.

02:56.023 --> 03:01.689
These valuable encounters
will help mature you.

03:04.531 --> 03:06.761
Wait!

03:07.267 --> 03:09.201
Hurry, hurry!

03:10.437 --> 03:12.598
ValuabIe encounters, huh...?

03:25.953 --> 03:28.979
Valuable encounters...

03:29.589 --> 03:32.387
H-Hey... This...

03:32.426 --> 03:35.020
Did you drop this?

03:35.062 --> 03:37.997
Yeah, that's mine.

03:38.031 --> 03:40.499
Got a problem with that?

03:41.468 --> 03:46.496
Hey, girl, which do you prefer,
bell peppers or shallots?

03:46.940 --> 03:50.899
How about some coffee--
oh, wait, since I put milk in it...

03:50.944 --> 03:55.074
...coffee-flavored milk--
with me at dawn?

03:57.317 --> 04:00.286
Are you all right?
Hold yourself together!

04:00.320 --> 04:01.651
The wound is deep!

04:01.688 --> 04:03.315
Don't give up!

04:03.357 --> 04:05.655
This calls for the last resort...

04:05.692 --> 04:07.387
Look at this!

04:10.230 --> 04:13.324
My little elephant!

04:15.769 --> 04:17.532
You idiot!

04:17.571 --> 04:18.936
Ouch!

04:18.972 --> 04:22.499
Is it punishment in
the name of the moon?

04:22.542 --> 04:24.203
I'll punish you when we get back home!

04:24.244 --> 04:25.541
Y-You monster!

04:25.579 --> 04:28.047
Who's the monster!?

04:28.415 --> 04:31.111
Even though she said
"a Iot of friends"...

04:31.151 --> 04:33.585
I do want to choose them,
at the least.

04:51.004 --> 04:54.405
I'm sure he was over here...

04:54.441 --> 04:56.204
Hey, Chibiusa.

04:57.644 --> 04:58.941
Mamo-chan!

04:59.679 --> 05:01.977
It's Mamo-chan! It's Mamo-chan!!

05:02.015 --> 05:03.312
Come on now...

05:03.350 --> 05:06.046
You know, I came here for training.

05:06.086 --> 05:06.916
Training?

05:06.953 --> 05:11.083
Yeah. Mom and Dad in the
future said that I should, too.

05:11.124 --> 05:12.853
Come on!

05:12.893 --> 05:14.451
Chibiusa!

05:14.494 --> 05:16.962
Mamo-chan is on a date
with me right now!

05:18.098 --> 05:19.759
He's MY Mamo-chan!

05:19.800 --> 05:21.529
No, you can't!

05:21.568 --> 05:23.593
- Get away from him!
- I don't want to!

05:23.637 --> 05:25.901
Hey, how about we all eat
takoyaki together, and not fight...?

05:31.144 --> 05:33.408
Here, I'll feed you some, Mamo-chan.

05:33.447 --> 05:34.812
No, that's what I do!

05:34.848 --> 05:36.406
No, ME!

05:36.983 --> 05:40.419
Oh, and here I thought
it was some happy family.

05:40.921 --> 05:45.290
The last time I saw you was
at the festival, right, kiddo?

05:45.325 --> 05:46.349
Haruka.

05:46.393 --> 05:48.452
Michiru.

05:49.596 --> 05:50.654
They're so pretty...

05:50.697 --> 05:52.631
They're just like Mom and Dad.

05:52.666 --> 05:57.126
Chibiusa, Haruka looks like
that, but she's a woman.

05:57.170 --> 06:00.435
And your mom from
the future is me, right?

06:01.041 --> 06:02.975
That just HAS to be a mistake!

06:03.009 --> 06:05.876
Mamo-chan I can understand, but I've
been thinking all along that you...

06:05.912 --> 06:07.709
You know...

06:07.747 --> 06:10.045
What!?

06:12.252 --> 06:14.686
Will you two cut it out already?

06:14.721 --> 06:15.449
Okay...

06:16.590 --> 06:20.686
We're going to have some tea now.
Would you like to join us?

06:20.727 --> 06:23.992
- Oh, no, I'll pass for today--
- Oh, tea? Sounds wonderful.

06:24.030 --> 06:26.260
I wanted to have some right about now.

06:26.299 --> 06:29.791
And cake with lots of
whipped cream, and cookies...

06:29.836 --> 06:35.103
Oh, pudding a la mode is also something
that I wanted to have right now... huh?

06:38.712 --> 06:40.202
By tea, you meant...

06:46.153 --> 06:47.711
You're...

06:47.754 --> 06:53.659
He's Tamasaburo, the master of the famous
Japanese tea style "Yaburakoji Burakoji."

06:53.693 --> 06:56.093
Welcome.

07:01.201 --> 07:03.169
It's destiny.

07:15.482 --> 07:17.473
Tea is great...

07:17.517 --> 07:20.645
Your heart finds peace.

07:31.164 --> 07:33.394
It's too HOT, you idiot!

07:33.433 --> 07:36.630
I think I've had enough for today.

07:36.670 --> 07:38.900
Oh, I have an idea!

07:39.472 --> 07:40.496
Yes...?

07:40.540 --> 07:41.905
Japanese tea ceremonies?

07:46.780 --> 07:48.111
I have found one.

07:48.148 --> 07:53.780
Very well. Then, I shall now prepare
a Daimohn most fit for that purpose.

08:12.105 --> 08:15.097
CHA-GA-MA!

08:52.946 --> 08:56.541
Ch-Chibiusa, my feet fell asleep!
Let's go home!

08:56.583 --> 08:59.950
I'm going to sit through this!
I'm different from you, Usagi!

09:01.121 --> 09:03.453
I see that the little one
is doing a better job.

09:03.857 --> 09:05.449
Wow, odango!

09:05.492 --> 09:07.687
Thanks, I'll have some!

09:49.369 --> 09:52.497
If it's too strenuous for you, feel
free to sit in a more relaxed manner.

09:52.772 --> 09:55.002
No, I'm all right.

09:56.509 --> 09:59.000
I shall show you something nice, then.

10:04.718 --> 10:05.582
Master...

10:06.486 --> 10:08.579
How considerate of others...

10:10.490 --> 10:13.948
The master is doing all
of this on purpose...

10:13.993 --> 10:16.120
...to relieve the tension of the
tea ceremony for you little ones.

10:16.162 --> 10:17.322
That bowl...

10:17.364 --> 10:19.958
Its rarity is at the level of a national
treasure, and if you were to buy it...

10:19.999 --> 10:22.092
...it would be over 10 million yen.

10:22.135 --> 10:25.593
O-Over 10 MILLION yen!?

10:26.506 --> 10:27.598
Oh, I'm all right.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.108
Please, s-s-s-stop! Something
that costs s-s-several million...

10:31.311 --> 10:32.369
My feet...

10:32.412 --> 10:33.606
...are asleep...

10:43.056 --> 10:45.820
You're a little heavy...

10:46.059 --> 10:47.117
Sorry...

10:47.160 --> 10:48.821
I just...

11:10.583 --> 11:11.709
I hate this!

11:11.751 --> 11:13.912
You embarrassed me
in front of Tamasaburo!

11:13.953 --> 11:16.444
I HATE you, Usagi!

11:16.489 --> 11:20.323
I was embarrassed too...
in front of Haruka and Michiru.

11:20.627 --> 11:22.322
You got what you deserved.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.630
What was that!?

11:25.665 --> 11:27.633
Usako!

11:29.469 --> 11:33.371
Are you getting fond
of Tamasaburo, Chibiusa?

11:34.874 --> 11:38.332
Um... Mom told me...

11:39.045 --> 11:42.845
She told me to make a lot of
friends in the 20th century...

11:43.082 --> 11:46.540
That it will create
valuable encounters...

11:46.586 --> 11:48.110
I see.

11:48.154 --> 11:52.181
You didn't have that many people to
play with in the future world, did you?

11:52.225 --> 11:55.854
So that was it? If you had told me so
earlier, I would have encouraged you.

11:56.463 --> 11:59.830
If you encouraged me, Usagi,
things would be in a bigger mess!

11:59.866 --> 12:00.764
Wha--!

12:00.800 --> 12:05.931
Well, at least we now know what's
going on. Both of you, make up.

12:21.821 --> 12:25.917
I... I'm going to make sure
I can be his apprentice!

12:25.959 --> 12:27.824
Don't get the kimono dirty.

12:27.861 --> 12:30.159
You're so cheap... it's not like
you're going to be wearing this again.

12:30.196 --> 12:33.029
- You don't have to call me cheap!
- Cheap, cheap, REALLY cheap!

12:33.066 --> 12:37.059
If you're going to call me that,
give me my kimono back!

12:38.571 --> 12:39.697
That was...

12:39.739 --> 12:41.001
Eugeal!

12:45.478 --> 12:48.003
She went into Tamasaburo's house!

12:51.618 --> 12:53.711
Luna!

12:53.753 --> 12:56.119
What are you doing!?

12:56.155 --> 12:58.988
I seem to be stuck here,
and can't do anything...

12:59.025 --> 13:01.755
Maybe you should go on a diet then...

13:01.794 --> 13:05.457
At least you can help
me out a little bit!

13:20.413 --> 13:22.847
Oh, did I hit something?

13:22.882 --> 13:24.315
May I ask who you are?

13:24.450 --> 13:26.179
Captured!

13:28.988 --> 13:31.149
Tamasaburo!

13:31.424 --> 13:35.190
MOON PRISM POWER, MAKE UP!

13:47.840 --> 13:49.239
Such a piece of cake.

13:49.275 --> 13:50.401
You can't!

13:51.411 --> 13:55.745
I won't let you take
Tamasaburo's heart away!

13:55.782 --> 13:58.910
For love and justice, an apprentice to
a pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

13:58.952 --> 14:02.353
- Appear before me, Daimohn!
- Sailor Chibi Moon!

14:06.092 --> 14:08.185
In the name of the
moon from the future...

14:08.227 --> 14:09.819
...I'll punish you!

14:09.862 --> 14:10.624
Eh?

14:10.663 --> 14:13.427
In the name of the
moon from the future...

14:13.466 --> 14:15.491
...I'LL PUNISH YOU!

14:18.137 --> 14:19.331
Chagarma!

14:19.372 --> 14:21.738
Someone is getting in my way!
Get rid of her!

14:31.584 --> 14:33.779
Now, hand over that pure heart...

14:36.789 --> 14:39.121
WORLD...

14:39.158 --> 14:41.285
...SHAKING!

14:47.333 --> 14:49.961
DEEP...

14:50.003 --> 14:51.265
...SUBMERGE!

14:54.707 --> 14:57.767
Guided by a new era,
Sailor Uranus...

14:57.810 --> 15:00.210
...acts with elegance!

15:01.447 --> 15:04.211
Also guided by a new era,
Sailor Neptune...

15:04.250 --> 15:06.411
...acts with grace!

15:08.021 --> 15:09.921
So you appear in front of me again!

15:09.956 --> 15:11.014
Thank you...

15:11.057 --> 15:13.958
We weren't trying to save you.

15:13.993 --> 15:15.255
Tough luck.

15:15.294 --> 15:17.125
This isn't a talisman.

15:17.397 --> 15:19.297
A failure.

15:19.732 --> 15:22.462
Chagarma! You can do whatever now.

15:22.502 --> 15:26.666
If it ends up THAT way,
you can do THAT, so do THAT!

15:27.907 --> 15:29.272
Selfish woman!

15:29.308 --> 15:31.799
In that case... I'll get every
single person that gets in my way!

15:33.946 --> 15:35.106
Where are the others!?

15:36.516 --> 15:38.108
W-What? They're gone!?

15:44.257 --> 15:46.623
PINK SUGAR...

15:46.659 --> 15:50.789
...HEART ATTACK!

16:10.917 --> 16:12.316
Delicious.

16:12.819 --> 16:15.310
Ouch! OUCH! Hey, you, stop that!

16:15.588 --> 16:18.284
Oh, Chibi Moon is fighting by herself!

16:18.324 --> 16:20.519
Usagi, hurry up and transform!

16:20.560 --> 16:22.118
I know that!

16:24.397 --> 16:27.764
MOON COSMIC POWER...

16:27.800 --> 16:30.268
...MAKE UP!

17:00.733 --> 17:03.361
Chibi Moon, leave the rest to me!

17:03.836 --> 17:05.303
Sorry to keep you waiting!

17:05.338 --> 17:07.704
The original, the true, the master!

17:07.740 --> 17:09.173
For love and justice...

17:09.208 --> 17:11.369
A pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

17:15.782 --> 17:17.374
Sailor Moon!

17:18.885 --> 17:22.616
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

17:22.655 --> 17:24.646
You're LATE!

17:24.690 --> 17:25.782
What?

17:25.825 --> 17:28.123
You're the one who ran ahead!

17:30.029 --> 17:32.122
Sailor Klutz Moon!

17:32.565 --> 17:35.033
Now, I will entertain the guests!

17:35.067 --> 17:36.329
Here you go!

17:36.369 --> 17:37.802
And have the next one!

17:37.837 --> 17:39.134
And another!

17:39.772 --> 17:41.637
Ouch...

17:44.577 --> 17:45.805
Look out!

17:45.845 --> 17:48.279
Here! Here! Here!

17:50.116 --> 17:51.845
Entertainment!

17:51.884 --> 17:54.284
Ouch! OW! Ouch...

17:54.487 --> 17:57.854
Those who do not understand
the soul of an entertainer...

17:57.890 --> 18:00.051
This is the last event for you!

18:04.430 --> 18:07.024
Cherishing the fleeting encounter,
and entertaining guests...

18:07.066 --> 18:09.694
...with a warm heart is the
true meaning of the tea ceremony!

18:09.735 --> 18:12.966
I will not allow you to stomp
upon such a warm heart!

18:13.706 --> 18:15.469
Tuxedo Mask!

18:16.742 --> 18:21.475
It seems that the time has come
for me to truly entertain someone...

18:26.452 --> 18:29.979
You shall be surprised at
how I truly entertain.

18:31.123 --> 18:32.488
Now, Sailor Moon!

18:34.126 --> 18:34.990
Okay!

18:55.248 --> 18:59.048
MOON SPIRAL...

18:59.085 --> 19:02.418
...HEART...

19:02.455 --> 19:04.946
...ATTACK!

19:08.928 --> 19:11.021
Oh, ur, I'm not ready yet...

19:12.465 --> 19:13.989
I said...

19:14.033 --> 19:17.366
LOVELY!

19:29.015 --> 19:31.882
This is the way it
should be, Sailor Moon.

19:32.585 --> 19:34.485
Sailor Moon...

19:34.520 --> 19:36.385
You know...

19:37.089 --> 19:38.886
What?

19:39.158 --> 19:40.591
You know...

19:40.626 --> 19:42.958
Thanks.

19:44.397 --> 19:47.560
The little one sure puts up a fight.

19:49.535 --> 19:52.333
So... awesome...

19:54.507 --> 19:58.341
I'm going to make sure I can
be his apprentice THIS time!

20:00.346 --> 20:02.337
Oh?

20:02.715 --> 20:05.309
Haruka and Michiru...

20:05.351 --> 20:07.842
They seem like they
came back in a hurry...

20:08.721 --> 20:10.348
Sorry to keep you waiting!

20:12.124 --> 20:14.957
In the awe I felt from the
soldiers in my dream...

20:14.994 --> 20:17.861
...I found a new path for
Japanese tea ceremonies.

20:18.397 --> 20:22.197
For courtesy and manners,
the handsome master in a sailor suit!

20:22.234 --> 20:23.826
Sailor Tamasaburo!

20:23.869 --> 20:26.099
YEAH!

20:28.274 --> 20:30.105
L-Let's head back...

20:33.105 --> 20:37.105
