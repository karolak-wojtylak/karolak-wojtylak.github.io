1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,298
What is a pure heart?

2
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:06,428
A pure heart that loves someone.

3
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:09,634
Our pure hearts of
friendship and kindness.

4
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:12,575
I want to treasure
such pure hearts.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,376
Chibiusa, even if you return
to the future, don't ever forget...

6
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:20,282
That our hearts are
always together as one!

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,865
What a beautiful moon.

8
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,733
Yeah.

9
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:33,163
It's quiet.

10
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:36,406
Yeah... Peaceful nights are so nice.

11
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:37,912
Mamo-chan...

12
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:41,513
You know... um...

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,780
Isn't it a little cold?

14
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:46,481
I guess it is...

15
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:51,552
I want you to warm me up...

16
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:54,755
Mamo-chan...

17
00:00:55,998 --> 00:00:58,330
Mamo-chan?

18
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:00,332
What are you doing?

19
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,234
What? Well, you're cold, right?

20
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,037
How about we go inside
and have some warm cocoa...

21
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:08,168
What's wrong?
Why are you pouting?

22
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,373
Sheesh! Mamo-chan,
you're so dense!

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,126
A beautiful starry sky...

24
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:38,198
A letter?

25
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,265
It's from Mama.

26
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,435
"To Small Lady.

27
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,842
How are you doing?

28
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:44,607
I'm lonely because I can't see you.

29
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,137
It's about time you came home.

30
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:47,114
-- From Mama.

31
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,946
PS. Papa is waiting, too."

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,081
Mama...

33
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:58,216
Small Lady.

34
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:00,961
Small Lady.

35
00:02:01,564 --> 00:02:04,328
Papa... Mama...

36
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:07,961
I'm home!

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,072
Usagi...

38
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:14,473
What's wrong?
What are you holding?

39
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:19,139
This...

40
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,877
Oh, let me see...

41
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:27,022
Chibiusa ... This...?

42
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:27,852
Yeah...

43
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:30,849
A letter from the future?

44
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:33,788
Yeah... she said it was
a letter from her mom...

45
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:36,354
Of course, that would be me...

46
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:40,130
And... was it all in hiragana?

47
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,004
Minako!!

48
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,030
It's not the time for that, is it!?

49
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:48,270
- Sorry!
- So, what was written on it?

50
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,278
Well... for her to come back now...

51
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:54,279
And, what did Chibiusa say?

52
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,279
Well...

53
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:58,980
It doesn't have to be right now...

54
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:01,751
If I wanted to go home,
I can go back when ever I want...

55
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:06,722
She's at that age where she wants
to be spoiled by her parents...

56
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:08,559
I think she does want
to see them after all...

57
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:10,565
I think so, too.

58
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,762
Maybe she just can't honestly
say that she wants to go back...

59
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:16,566
Chibiusa is the type who doesn't
want to show her weakness to others...

60
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:20,539
Now that the trouble
has settled down...

61
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:24,512
I would like to send Chibiusa
back to her parents' place.

62
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:27,572
Let's give her some
good memories of us!

63
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,846
Is there a good way?

64
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:32,850
How about a farewell party?

65
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:35,718
Oh, you say something
good once in a while.

66
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,282
That's a good idea.

67
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:39,226
Let's start getting ready for it!

68
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,855
Then, I'll make a feast!

69
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,027
Hey, and where are
we going to have it?

70
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:47,126
How about Mamoru's condo?
Usagi, can you ask?

71
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:47,863
Yeah...

72
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:51,365
A farewell party?

73
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:55,870
That's right. We decided to have it
at Mamo-chan's place tomorrow.

74
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:59,306
That can't be... I haven't decided
on going back immediately yet...

75
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:01,873
We all talked it out and decided.

76
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,851
You don't need to hold back.

77
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:07,117
Let's have a huge party
and have a rowdy time!

78
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:11,124
You want me to go back that badly?

79
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:15,696
Nothing!

80
00:04:16,332 --> 00:04:17,629
Chibiusa!?

81
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,000
How strange...

82
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:22,299
It doesn't look like she's
too happy about it.

83
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:24,135
Yeah...

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,769
Usagi, you idiot!

85
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,403
If I go back to the future,
it means that...

86
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:34,280
...I won't be able to see you,
Mamo-chan, or everyone else!

87
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,281
To not be able to see everyone...

88
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:43,557
I don't want that...

89
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:51,690
I don't want that at all.

90
00:04:51,734 --> 00:04:53,565
I don't!!

91
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:56,163
You know, Usagi...

92
00:04:56,205 --> 00:05:02,075
You mentioned a gift for Chibiusa, but didn't
you spend all of your allowance already?

93
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:03,437
It's all right.

94
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,175
It's a gift for Chibiusa who's
going back to the future!

95
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:10,117
It has to be a wonderful gift
that money can't buy!

96
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:11,312
Here it is!

97
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:16,986
This is the one-piece dress that
I really liked when I was little!

98
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,589
Chibiusa?

99
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:24,599
Mamo-chan...

100
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:27,600
What's wrong?

101
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:33,605
I can't understand if you stay quiet.

102
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:35,371
Anyway, come on in.

103
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,605
Y-Yeah...

104
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:49,115
Mamo-chan, does everyone hate me?

105
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,723
Why do you think that?

106
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,526
This farewell party is so sudden...

107
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,124
It sounds like they want
me to go back so soon.

108
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:04,138
Everyone is thinking about how
nice it would be if you could stay...

109
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:07,742
But you're still a child, Chibiusa.

110
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:10,609
It's best for you to
live with your parents.

111
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:14,776
Don't you want to see your
parents as well, Chibiusa?

112
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:19,383
It's tough for Usako and the others
to be parting with you, too, Chibiusa.

113
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,816
Mamo-chan...

114
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:30,857
Are you going to be
sad, too, Mamo-chan?

115
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,858
Of course I will, too.

116
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:36,771
Mamo-chan!

117
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:39,205
Mamo-chan!

118
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,545
Ouch!

119
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:56,153
Usagi?

120
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:57,624
What are you doing?

121
00:06:57,993 --> 00:07:00,120
N-Nothing.

122
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:02,323
Kids should go to sleep early!

123
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:04,594
But...

124
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:05,965
Good night.

125
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:10,728
I'm sorry, Chibiusa...

126
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:13,734
Usagi, you're an idiot!

127
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:17,802
You don't understand
my feelings at ALL!

128
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,126
To Chibiusa's future!

129
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:09,623
Now, eat up!

130
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,933
Chibiusa, cheer up.

131
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:16,404
The future is just a little further than
Hokkaido, and it's closer than heaven.

132
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:19,134
You can come back
again anytime you want!

133
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:22,473
Usagi, have you
ever gone to heaven?

134
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:23,739
No...

135
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:26,009
Why do you need to correct her?

136
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:29,643
Well, let's have a blast!
First, I'll sing a song!

137
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:31,649
Yeah! I've been waiting for that!

138
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:53,636
Rangy!

139
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,970
Pure hearts...

140
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:03,646
I must collect pure hearts...

141
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:31,539
Now, Chibiusa, we have
presents foryou.

142
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,639
You go first, Mako-chan.

143
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,085
Here, Chibiusa.
I packed you a lunch!

144
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,180
Heat it up in the microwave
and eat it with your parents!

145
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:42,781
Thanks, Mako-chan.

146
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:45,088
I programmed this.

147
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,619
Sheesh, Ami, academics
even for a time like this?

148
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:51,633
Studying when you are
young is very important...

149
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:55,103
Study hard, and when
you're tired, play with this.

150
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:58,038
It's an original game I made,
and everyone's in it.

151
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:00,031
Thanks, Ami.

152
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:05,373
The gift from me is a cassette
with my singing in it!

153
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:08,645
I made the last song
Just for you, Chibiusa.

154
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,117
Take time to listen to it.

155
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,380
Thanks, Rei.

156
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,652
I compiled all the photos we
took together in an album.

157
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:19,358
See? They're all our fun memories.

158
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:20,361
Here, can you hold all of it?

159
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:22,363
Yeah. Thanks, Minako.

160
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:24,763
Chibiusa.

161
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,060
Mamo-chan.

162
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,830
A red rosebud means
"purity" and "cuteness."

163
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,403
It fits you perfectly, Chibiusa.

164
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:36,843
Mamo-chan...

165
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:41,573
Will everyone's gifts fit in this...?

166
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:44,713
Usagi... this is...?

167
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:47,813
Well... it doesn't look all that great, but...

168
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,586
Wow, a cute backpack of a puppy!!

169
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,785
It's well-made!

170
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:54,762
Rei! This isn't a puppy!
It's a rabbit!!

171
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,761
Oh... I-I'm sorry, it is a rabbit now
that I looked at it more closely.

172
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:02,332
Rei, you always make
fun of me like that!

173
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,998
Do you have some grudge
against me or something!?

174
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,564
What!? You don't have to put it that way!

175
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:08,769
I just said a dog because
it looked like a dog!

176
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,404
You don't have to keep
saying "dog" like that!

177
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:14,677
You're so annoying!
Don't bark at me like some stray dog!

178
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,082
There, you said "dog" again!

179
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,644
Sheesh, you overexerted
yourself knowing you're clumsy!

180
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:21,781
You've got scratches all over!
Here!

181
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:24,282
At least put bandages on them.

182
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:26,492
Thanks.

183
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,462
Here, I'll put them on for you.

184
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:31,295
I'll help you with those, Chibiusa.
Let me see...

185
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,002
Chibiusa, Usagi seems to have made that to
the best of her ability, after many failures...

186
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,630
I'm jealous...

187
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:42,302
Rei and Usagi can say
anything they want to each other...

188
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:44,778
They say that the more you argue,
the better friends you are...

189
00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:47,805
I wish I had a friend that
I could be like that with...

190
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:56,756
Here is fine.

191
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:59,125
It will only be tougher...

192
00:11:59,161 --> 00:12:01,823
Thanks, everyone.

193
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:07,327
I troubled you for lots of things...

194
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,329
Keep doing your best even
when you go back to the future.

195
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:13,034
Listen to what your
parents have to say.

196
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:15,702
Please give my regards
to everyone in the future.

197
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:16,768
Take care.

198
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:20,043
Do remember us every so often.

199
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:23,912
Usagi.

200
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:30,123
Chibiusa...

201
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:36,219
Good-bye...

202
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,900
Chibiusa!

203
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:41,425
- Usagi!
- Wait!

204
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,431
Can you leave them alone...?

205
00:12:57,085 --> 00:12:58,552
Oh, Guardian of Time...

206
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:02,853
Doors of time, break open the skies,
and release them for me!

207
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:06,258
I call out your true name,
oh almighty lord of time...

208
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:09,696
Father of guardians, Chronos!

209
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:11,631
Guide me!

210
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,759
Protect me!

211
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:16,828
Show me the path of light!

212
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:21,067
Chibiusa!

213
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:23,066
Usagi!!

214
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,008
You can't... be crying.

215
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:36,080
You're going to go back to
your parents' place, and you're...

216
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,183
You're going to be happy...

217
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:42,856
Idiot Usagi...
You're the one who's crying.

218
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,032
It's funny...
I promised not to cry.

219
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:51,869
I made up my mind that I would
see you off without crying...

220
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,614
Usagi! I don't want to!!

221
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:08,616
Be on good terms with
your parents of the future...!!

222
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:21,097
Good-bye, Usagi!

223
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:35,711
Usagi!

224
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,920
A terrible thing has happened!

225
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:45,285
One of the Death Busters'
eggs was still left.

226
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:47,557
And that egg turned into a Daimohn!

227
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,860
The pure hearts of people all over
town are getting sucked into it!

228
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:50,830
Where is it?

229
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:53,390
At the Tenoh Sandbank...
Where Mugen Academy used to be!

230
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:01,339
Mama! Mama!!

231
00:15:13,888 --> 00:15:17,847
I can't ever forgive you for taking
pure hearts from everyone!

232
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,991
For love and justice,
the pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

233
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,861
Sailor Moon!

234
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:25,957
And the Sailor Team!

235
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,367
And I, Tuxedo Mask...

236
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:33,637
In the name of the moon,
we'll punish you!

237
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,302
That doesn't work at all!

238
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:38,774
Pure hearts...

239
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,246
Pure hearts...

240
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:43,682
BURNING...

241
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:49,246
...MANDALA!!

242
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:56,993
Dammit!

243
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:00,427
SPARKLING...

244
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:03,164
...WIDE PRESSURE!

245
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,965
Rangy!

246
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:13,745
SHINE AQUA...

247
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:15,680
...ILLUSION!

248
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:23,915
VENUS...

249
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,152
...LOVE ME...

250
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,161
...CHAIN!

251
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,105
Pure hearts...

252
00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:44,076
I-It's strong...!!

253
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:58,582
It's Crystal Tokyo...

254
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,592
Papa... Mama...!!

255
00:17:11,206 --> 00:17:14,004
Pure hearts...

256
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:31,889
Pure hearts...

257
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:34,928
Pure hearts...

258
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:38,626
I-If only I had the Grail...
I could become Super Sailor Moon!

259
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,328
S-Sailor Moon...

260
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:44,330
PINK SUGAR...

261
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:47,398
...HEART ATTACK!!

262
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,299
Chibi Moon!

263
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:52,779
Chibi Moon!

264
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:58,308
The Sailor Team are my dear friends!

265
00:17:58,486 --> 00:18:02,183
I can't forgive you for
going after their pure hearts!

266
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:06,284
For love and Justice, an apprentice
to a pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

267
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:08,659
Sailor Chibi Moon!

268
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,994
In the name of the future moon...

269
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:13,000
...I'll punish you!

270
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:17,535
Look out!

271
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:19,301
It's no time to be posing!!

272
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:31,047
A maiden's heart that thinks of others is
stronger and more beautiful than anything else.

273
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:36,421
I, Tuxedo Mask, will not forgive anyone
who threatens the safety off air maidens!

274
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:39,051
Sailor Moon, believe in your friends!

275
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:40,322
Right!

276
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:53,406
That's right...
Even if I don't have a Grail...

277
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:58,401
...I can protect everyone with my
pure heart that cares about others!

278
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:04,609
MOON SPIRAL...

279
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:07,780
...HEART...

280
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:10,256
...ATTACK!!

281
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:21,766
LOVELY!!

282
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,774
You did it, Sailor Moon!

283
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:37,512
Well done, Sailor Moon.

284
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,213
Perhaps the Grail...

285
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:43,520
...is actually the pure heart itself
that cares about others.

286
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:49,959
Wow! What a beautiful sunrise!

287
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:51,659
Why are you here!?

288
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:54,395
You guys are so helpless without me!

289
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:55,527
What was that!?

290
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,629
All right, everyone, let's get her!

291
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,411
Oh, it's Luna-P!

292
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:09,040
It's got a letter in its mouth.

293
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,284
"Dear Small Lady.

294
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,378
Thanks for the souvenirs!

295
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:17,858
Don't be too much of a nuisance to your
big sister Usagi, and be a good girl!

296
00:20:17,892 --> 00:20:19,120
Bye!

297
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,857
P.S. Bring more souvenirs
back next time!"

298
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:26,323
It is Usagi after all...

299
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:31,168
So, I'll be around for a bit more!

300
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:38,168
