WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:04.491
If there's love in
confessing your feelings...

00:04.532 --> 00:07.057
...with all your heart to
that girl you've fallen for...

00:07.101 --> 00:09.797
...there's also love in saying
nothing and watching over her...

00:09.871 --> 00:12.772
...bearing it all
without a sweat.

00:13.074 --> 00:15.565
A Daimohn is after
such a pure heart!

00:15.610 --> 00:17.578
You're a little bug that's
getting in the way!

00:17.612 --> 00:20.046
I'll punish you in the
name of the moon!

00:50.200 --> 00:52.930
That ominous dream
I've been having lately...

00:55.606 --> 00:59.098
What is it trying to foretell?

01:14.524 --> 01:17.049
Yuichiro...

01:21.298 --> 01:23.061
A young man
with many worries.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.625
What are you looking
at so late at night?

01:26.937 --> 01:28.734
I-It's not that!

01:28.772 --> 01:30.797
I'm just worried
about Rei's health!

01:32.175 --> 01:35.303
It seems that lately, she's doing
that all night, every night...

01:35.345 --> 01:37.506
Still, Rei isn't one to
stop, even if we tell her to.

01:37.547 --> 01:39.708
It should be okay
once in a while.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.615
B-But...!

01:42.419 --> 01:45.320
I don't know what Rei is
trying to see through...

01:45.355 --> 01:46.982
...but there is only one truth.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.549
We have to let her do it
until she's satisfied.

01:49.593 --> 01:52.153
"I am my own Lord through
Heaven and Earth," that is.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.755
That is, we have
no problem, right?

01:55.365 --> 01:57.663
You say that, but...

02:03.073 --> 02:06.099
Hello, Rei! You shouldn't
put too much spirit into it!

02:06.143 --> 02:07.633
Have a cup noodle...

02:09.613 --> 02:11.638
I won't lose!

02:12.049 --> 02:13.573
Here you go!

02:13.617 --> 02:15.778
HERE! CURRY, okay to
eat in 3 minutes!

02:15.819 --> 02:18.754
Spaghetti with meat sauce,
easily prepared in the microwave!

02:18.789 --> 02:21.917
Your favorites: omelet lunch
and tuna sandwiches!

02:21.958 --> 02:24.825
Friends of all-nighters, roasted
rice-balls and natto rolls...

02:24.861 --> 02:27.329
...for when you need a
quick stick! And the dessert:

02:27.397 --> 02:30.025
Coconut gel and bananas!

02:33.403 --> 02:34.995
Rei...

02:35.038 --> 02:38.007
What in the world are you so
seriously trying to foretell?

02:38.675 --> 02:41.439
Is there something
that I can do to help?

02:42.846 --> 02:46.714
Rin, Byo, Toh...

02:46.750 --> 02:48.650
Sha, Kai...

02:48.685 --> 02:50.550
Jin, Retsu...

02:50.587 --> 02:52.555
Zai, Zen.

03:05.302 --> 03:06.769
Oh? Yuichiro?

03:06.837 --> 03:09.271
Yes... U-Um, Rei?

03:09.306 --> 03:12.104
Sorry, but if you want something,
can you talk to me later?

03:12.175 --> 03:14.166
This is a very
important fortune...

03:15.212 --> 03:16.474
Okay?

03:16.947 --> 03:18.312
Sure...

03:18.915 --> 03:20.314
Oh, then have this.

03:20.350 --> 03:23.319
You can tie your hair back.
So it doesn't get charred.

03:23.353 --> 03:24.547
Thanks.

03:28.658 --> 03:30.990
It's no good, I can't
possibly stop her.

03:31.061 --> 03:33.086
I'm so powerless.

03:40.003 --> 03:41.766
GIoria...

03:41.805 --> 03:45.366
This is the ultimate
creation born from chemistry.

03:45.408 --> 03:48.002
It truly is a
LIVING art form.

03:48.078 --> 03:51.104
That's right!
A living art form...

03:51.148 --> 03:54.140
The best work I've spent
my heart and blood for!

03:54.184 --> 03:56.243
But you, Kaorinite!

03:56.286 --> 03:59.813
You always make a waste
of these Daimohn eggs!

03:59.856 --> 04:02.017
Always, always, ALWAYS!!

04:03.426 --> 04:05.121
Please don't worry.

04:05.162 --> 04:08.290
My plans, based on
perfect calculations...

04:08.331 --> 04:10.959
...and harmony, are also art.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.197
Until now,
I've had interruptions...

04:13.236 --> 04:15.329
...that were outside
of my calculations.

04:16.573 --> 04:18.700
I will make sure to
get the talismans...

04:18.742 --> 04:21.404
...that are necessary
to get the Holy Grail.

04:21.645 --> 04:23.135
That's right...

04:23.180 --> 04:26.308
The end of this world,
the arrival of the darkness...

04:26.383 --> 04:29.079
...and the destruction
of everything!

04:29.119 --> 04:32.145
The time limit is
fast approaching!

04:38.628 --> 04:41.392
Go, Kaorinite.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.021
As you wish.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.935
All these all-nighters are
starting to get to me.

04:50.974 --> 04:52.942
Maybe I should skip
the study group...

04:55.412 --> 04:57.607
Rei must be very tired...

04:58.248 --> 05:00.614
Rei must be very tired...

05:00.650 --> 05:05.781
Yuichiro said as he silently watched
over the figure of Rei as she left.

05:05.856 --> 05:07.016
To be continued...

05:07.057 --> 05:08.752
Usagi...

05:08.825 --> 05:11.225
You want to watch over
someone you love forever.

05:11.261 --> 05:13.923
Yeah, I know.
I understand that feeling.

05:13.964 --> 05:16.057
Hey, you, Handsome.
You make me jealous!

05:16.233 --> 05:17.894
You're the best guy in Japan!

05:17.968 --> 05:20.027
Well, it's not that big...

05:20.670 --> 05:22.399
N-No, that's not it.

05:22.472 --> 05:24.565
I'm just worried about Rei...

05:24.608 --> 05:25.666
Worried?

05:25.709 --> 05:28.075
Yes. Lately, she's
been saying how she can...

05:28.111 --> 05:31.274
...concentrate more at night, and
so she's been cutting her sleep...

05:31.314 --> 05:34.681
...and trying to foretell something.
Her health will suffer at this rate!

05:34.718 --> 05:37.516
Oh, so, it really
must be THAT!

05:37.554 --> 05:39.715
Not even doctors or the hot
springs of Kusatsu can help.

05:39.789 --> 05:41.416
Y-You have an
idea what it is?

05:41.491 --> 05:43.755
Of course, I'm a girl!

05:43.793 --> 05:46.660
Something like
"I can't sleep at night!"...

05:47.063 --> 05:49.827
Of course, she's worried
about love!

05:51.201 --> 05:52.259
L-Love...?!

05:52.969 --> 05:55.665
Who... Who in the world
is she worried about?

05:55.739 --> 05:57.604
You are so dense!

05:57.641 --> 06:02.806
Rei's trying to see if she'll be
happy if she marries you, Yuichiro!

06:04.447 --> 06:06.711
R-Rei...and I...

06:06.750 --> 06:08.877
M-M-Marry...?!

06:09.085 --> 06:10.712
Oh, my, you're blushing.

06:10.754 --> 06:14.417
I'm jealous, I'm jealous! I want
to live with Mamo-chan, too!

06:14.457 --> 06:16.448
Oh, no!
You're embarrassing me!

06:16.493 --> 06:19.223
Oh, don't tell Rei
I told you this!

06:19.262 --> 06:20.661
Bye!

06:21.865 --> 06:24.265
Rei...and I...

06:26.670 --> 06:28.763
This is adolescence!

06:28.805 --> 06:30.238
What's with HIM?

06:34.311 --> 06:37.041
So, this is the vehicle known
as the city train.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.980
If I use this, I can
automatically check...

06:39.015 --> 06:42.382
...all the people getting
on and getting off.

06:42.452 --> 06:44.477
This is wonderfully useful.

06:44.554 --> 06:45.816
Go.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.599
Now, all we do is wait for someone
with a pure heart to appear...

07:14.884 --> 07:16.647
That can't be!

07:17.754 --> 07:19.346
Oh, no, Haruka!

07:19.389 --> 07:22.449
I don't open my mouth
THAT wide to yawn!

07:23.593 --> 07:26.084
See, you have those
circles under your eyes!

07:27.263 --> 07:29.288
You're kidding!

07:30.266 --> 07:31.961
The hand on her cheek...

07:32.002 --> 07:33.264
Here.

07:33.470 --> 07:35.097
I'll take you home.

07:35.138 --> 07:36.833
If you walk around like that,
deprived of sleep...

07:36.873 --> 07:37.999
...you'll cause an accident.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.666
I'm so lucky!

07:41.678 --> 07:43.441
R-Rei...

07:43.680 --> 07:45.978
I-I lose...

07:46.249 --> 07:49.218
Rei... With a guy like that...

07:50.653 --> 07:52.883
My adolescence is...

07:52.922 --> 07:54.856
OVER!!!!

07:58.628 --> 08:01.597
- Ready?
- Oh, wait a minute.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.325
What's that string?

08:05.368 --> 08:06.835
You don't put on ribbons or such?

08:06.870 --> 08:08.201
This is fine.

08:09.773 --> 08:12.708
It's something like a charm...

08:14.110 --> 08:15.236
That was insulting.

08:15.278 --> 08:17.337
Despite what you may think,
I do ride safely.

08:17.380 --> 08:19.041
Hold on tight!

08:19.883 --> 08:21.180
Oh, it's fast!

08:24.587 --> 08:26.953
Rei! Hey, wake up!

08:28.158 --> 08:29.284
Are you all right?

08:29.325 --> 08:31.054
You seem to be deprived
of sleep lately.

08:31.094 --> 08:34.154
You shouldn't overexert yourself,
even with the exams coming up.

08:34.197 --> 08:37.963
No way! If I could do that,
I wouldn't be having trouble.

08:38.134 --> 08:40.068
I'll go wash my face a bit.

08:41.171 --> 08:42.297
I'm jealous...

08:42.338 --> 08:44.636
Life is short, so maidens
should fall in love!

08:44.674 --> 08:45.868
Love?

08:46.443 --> 08:48.468
Usagi, do you
know something?

08:48.545 --> 08:50.672
Yeah. Call it a woman's hunch!

08:50.713 --> 08:53.477
But that's
not reliable...

08:53.516 --> 08:56.644
Your hunches for what will be
on the exam keep missing, too.

08:56.686 --> 08:59.018
I keep saying exams
aren't about guessing.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.691
You don't look
like you're lovesick.

09:03.359 --> 09:07.295
Romantic worries can be hard,
but you'd look a bit more excited.

09:07.330 --> 09:10.731
Rei, you're worried about
something else, right?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.827
Maybe about our new enemy?

09:13.903 --> 09:17.498
Hey, Rei, you don't have to
worry all by yourself.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.005
Care to tell me about it?

09:19.042 --> 09:20.907
Thanks, Mako-chan...

09:21.311 --> 09:23.836
But I don't
know myself yet.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.280
What the reason
for this unease is...

09:27.450 --> 09:29.441
If I find out, then...

09:29.519 --> 09:32.488
Then it will be time
for the Sailor Soldiers.

09:32.555 --> 09:34.614
Oh, but... I hope
it doesn't come...

09:34.657 --> 09:36.750
...on the day before the exam,
if they can help it.

09:41.831 --> 09:45.494
Who is that guy...?
Who in the world is that?

09:46.302 --> 09:47.929
Dammit!

10:01.284 --> 10:03.445
This is a beautiful song...

10:04.454 --> 10:05.785
That's...!

10:06.556 --> 10:11.220
Michiru... Is what we are trying
to do something worthless?

10:11.261 --> 10:14.594
Haruka... What's wrong?
This doesn't sound like you.

10:14.631 --> 10:17.327
If it's too late
no matter what we do...

10:17.400 --> 10:19.129
Why are we doing this?

10:20.803 --> 10:22.703
We started this knowing that.

10:22.739 --> 10:26.004
Haruka, the wheels of destiny
have already started turning.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.272
A new awakening will
arrive again very soon.

10:28.311 --> 10:31.644
The only thing we can do is
to collect the three talismans.

10:31.681 --> 10:33.546
For that...

10:34.117 --> 10:36.347
Even if it means
sacrificing everything...

10:36.386 --> 10:40.083
I'm sorry. My will was
weakened by the moonlit night.

10:43.826 --> 10:46.294
That guy's two-timing!

10:47.830 --> 10:50.162
I won't forgive him!

11:19.729 --> 11:21.959
Are you Yuichiro Kumada?

11:22.765 --> 11:24.824
Whatever you want,
make it quick.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.596
I'm busier than
I look, you know.

11:29.005 --> 11:31.496
Shut up and fight me!

11:31.774 --> 11:34.675
Do you have some
grudge against me?

11:34.711 --> 11:36.508
Why don't you ask
your own heart!?

11:36.546 --> 11:38.241
Here I go!

11:39.515 --> 11:41.210
Oh, well...

11:43.553 --> 11:44.986
Are you all right?

11:45.021 --> 11:47.012
Not yet! This fight
still is far from over!

11:47.056 --> 11:48.421
Come on...

11:54.163 --> 11:55.721
Y-You're pretty good!

11:57.634 --> 12:00.398
Yuichiro? And Haruka?

12:00.603 --> 12:03.071
Hey, can you knock
it off already?

12:03.139 --> 12:05.232
This is adolescence!

12:05.275 --> 12:07.539
- Yuichiro!
- Rei!

12:09.479 --> 12:10.741
Haruka!

12:14.550 --> 12:17.815
Yuichiro, what's the meaning
of this?! Explain it!

12:17.887 --> 12:19.252
Rei...

12:19.622 --> 12:21.613
So, you're covering
for him after all.

12:22.659 --> 12:25.287
No, don't say
anything anymore...

12:26.663 --> 12:28.255
Haruka Tenoh...

12:28.298 --> 12:32.291
You're a two-timer, but you're
probably a very masculine guy.

12:32.335 --> 12:33.233
Hey...!

12:33.269 --> 12:35.737
Stop all of this
that's hurting Rei, and...

12:35.772 --> 12:38.138
And break up with that
other girlfriend!

12:38.174 --> 12:39.869
That's all I want to say.

12:39.909 --> 12:41.843
U-Um... Who are...?

12:42.312 --> 12:45.213
Rei...
Please be happy with him.

12:48.484 --> 12:49.815
Shouldn't you
go after him?

12:49.852 --> 12:51.911
I don't know anyone like him.

12:51.954 --> 12:54.616
He's such an idiot...

12:55.892 --> 12:57.291
Looks like it's
finally calmed down.

12:57.327 --> 12:59.022
Rei didn't come back.

12:59.062 --> 13:01.053
I hope she didn't
get soaked somewhere.

13:01.097 --> 13:03.622
Yuichiro didn't seem
to be around, either.

13:03.666 --> 13:05.600
Maybe the two of them are
sharing an umbrella, and...

13:07.570 --> 13:08.832
Maybe...

13:08.871 --> 13:10.805
- Usagi!
- We have a problem!

13:10.840 --> 13:12.535
Everyone, come over here!

13:13.242 --> 13:16.075
This is a rather
sudden departure.

13:17.613 --> 13:19.911
Please forgive me.

13:20.850 --> 13:23.375
Well, I'm sure you'll have a
lot going on in your long life.

13:23.419 --> 13:24.317
Fare you well.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.413
I, Yuichiro Kumada, will never
forget your kindness.

13:28.825 --> 13:29.484
Wait!

13:29.525 --> 13:30.890
What happened?

13:30.927 --> 13:32.292
Where are you going?

13:32.328 --> 13:34.057
Please, don't ask.

13:38.267 --> 13:43.830
I will depart on a journey tomorrow.

13:43.873 --> 13:49.175
Alone with someone
that you don't know.

13:49.212 --> 13:54.206
It was a trip that I was going
to take with you someday.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.177
Idiot...

13:58.621 --> 14:00.248
Yuichiro, you're an idiot.

14:06.195 --> 14:07.856
We have to hurry after him!

14:07.897 --> 14:08.864
It's all right now...

14:08.931 --> 14:10.694
It's not, Rei!!

14:10.733 --> 14:13.827
Yuichiro is really going away!

14:13.870 --> 14:16.498
That blockhead who
jumps to conclusions...

14:16.572 --> 14:18.233
...can go where he wants!

14:19.575 --> 14:23.807
Rei! Yuichiro was
worried about you!

14:23.846 --> 14:26.406
He really cares for you from
the bottom of his heart!

14:26.449 --> 14:27.473
Then...!

14:28.684 --> 14:30.743
Then, why...!?

14:31.187 --> 14:34.520
Why didn't he believe in
me till the very end!?

14:34.557 --> 14:36.024
Rei...

14:37.360 --> 14:39.988
You just have to
tell Yuichiro that!

14:40.530 --> 14:42.088
Usagi.

14:42.698 --> 14:46.498
Don't mope about it!
Go and make up!

14:46.536 --> 14:49.528
- Rei, I'll hold your bag.
- Do your best.

14:49.939 --> 14:52.237
Thanks, everyone...

14:52.275 --> 14:57.508
It looks like I won't be
able to tell you goodbye...

14:57.547 --> 15:03.247
...no matter how much time passes.

15:03.286 --> 15:15.926
To me, you will always be
a bright part of my youth.

15:15.965 --> 15:21.870
I'll board the Azusa No. 2
right at 8 o'clock...

15:21.904 --> 15:31.939
...and I... I will depart from you.

15:47.597 --> 15:49.121
TODEN!

15:50.800 --> 15:53.325
All passengers, please hurry!

15:53.870 --> 15:55.633
Monster!

15:56.439 --> 15:58.839
We finally caught one!

15:58.875 --> 16:01.639
Toden! Take the pure heart
that loves someone!

16:01.677 --> 16:02.644
TODEN!

16:02.712 --> 16:03.974
All right!

16:08.117 --> 16:09.049
Yuichiro!

16:10.219 --> 16:14.849
MARS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!

16:34.944 --> 16:36.070
Hold it right there!

16:37.580 --> 16:40.515
To steal the pure
heart of that man!

16:41.884 --> 16:45.479
For love and passion, the
pretty soldier in a sailor suit!

16:47.523 --> 16:49.787
I, Sailor Mars,
will not allow it!

16:49.859 --> 16:52.692
In the name of Mars,
I chastise you!

16:55.631 --> 16:57.121
Yuichiro!

16:57.166 --> 16:58.030
TODEN!

16:59.135 --> 17:02.593
Standing passengers, please
hold on to the hand straps!

17:04.373 --> 17:07.604
This isn't a talisman either.
Looks like another wasted trip.

17:12.848 --> 17:16.375
VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!

17:18.688 --> 17:20.519
The pure heart is safe.

17:20.556 --> 17:21.921
You again...

17:23.459 --> 17:25.757
The slogan of the city train is
"No accidents, no violations"!

17:25.861 --> 17:27.419
If bad kids can't
follow that slogan, then...

17:29.031 --> 17:32.660
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

17:32.902 --> 17:35.063
Toden, I'm leaving
you with the rest!

17:35.137 --> 17:37.799
New line creation!

17:37.873 --> 17:39.397
W-What!? What's going on?

17:39.475 --> 17:42.239
Please wait for
the next departure.

17:43.212 --> 17:46.943
Front all clear! Sides all clear!

17:48.384 --> 17:50.409
All right for departure!

17:54.757 --> 17:58.193
SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!

17:59.595 --> 18:01.722
SAFETY...FIRST!

18:02.732 --> 18:03.630
Look out!

18:03.666 --> 18:05.725
TODEN! New line creation!

18:08.137 --> 18:10.901
The next stop is
the afterlife!

18:11.807 --> 18:13.138
Your lives are mine!

18:13.909 --> 18:15.809
EVIL SPIRIT, BEGONE!!!

18:17.546 --> 18:18.945
E-Emergency Stop!?

18:20.182 --> 18:22.207
Move! MOVE!!!

18:22.418 --> 18:24.147
Now it's OUR turn!

18:24.220 --> 18:26.916
The sin of trying to steal
Yuichiro's heart is a heavy one!

18:27.456 --> 18:29.390
Prepare yourself!

18:29.659 --> 18:36.189
BURNING MANDALA!

18:39.135 --> 18:42.502
Carrying dangerous items into
the train is strictly forbidden!

18:47.643 --> 18:49.440
- Sailor Moon!
- OK!

19:09.632 --> 19:17.471
MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!

19:28.217 --> 19:30.981
Lovely!

19:41.464 --> 19:43.864
They're pretty good.

19:50.372 --> 19:51.066
Ouch...

19:51.107 --> 19:53.667
Don't force yourself!
You're hurt.

19:53.976 --> 19:56.672
- W-What about that monster...?
- What are you saying?

19:56.712 --> 19:59.306
Did you have some dream
after you slipped and fell?

20:02.752 --> 20:03.844
T-This is...?

20:03.886 --> 20:07.083
You should think more about it.
Next time, give me a ribbon!

20:07.123 --> 20:07.885
O-Okay.

20:07.923 --> 20:09.720
We're going home now.
Can you stand up?

20:09.759 --> 20:10.748
B-But...

20:10.826 --> 20:13.317
You have to apologize
to Haruka later!

20:13.362 --> 20:15.956
You picked a fight against
a meek little girl!

20:16.031 --> 20:17.726
A GIRL?!

20:18.200 --> 20:19.462
Ouch...

20:19.502 --> 20:22.903
You really are absent-minded!
Now, give me your stuff!

20:22.938 --> 20:23.905
O-Okay...

20:23.939 --> 20:26.066
Here, do you want me to
lend you a shoulder?

20:26.142 --> 20:28.906
- I-I'm all right.
- It's all right. Here, hold on...

20:31.906 --> 20:35.906
