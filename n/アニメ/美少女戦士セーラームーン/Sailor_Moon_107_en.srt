1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,963
Chibiusa has a boyfriend?

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:07,368
Because I'm her guardian,
I can't just sit and watch!

3
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:11,307
I'll become the cupid of love,
and do some matchmaking!

4
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:12,502
Become better friends!

5
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:14,374
Become better friends!

6
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:17,438
Hey, now, you over there that's getting
in the way of my spell of love!

7
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:20,383
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,632
Isn't there something?

9
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:36,371
Sheesh, this house really has NOTHING!

10
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,003
Oh, there IS something!

11
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:41,174
Such a good thing, too!

12
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,413
Let's see...

13
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,449
Now, everyone eat up!

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,118
W-Where did you get this apple pie...?

15
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,719
Usagi, I hope YOU didn't make it...

16
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:56,428
It was in the oven...

17
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:59,593
I think Mom baked it
and left it here for us...

18
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:02,865
Then we can eat it without fear.

19
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:07,370
Well, we don't want to get food poisoning
right before our entrance exams.

20
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:10,236
What's THAT supposed to mean!?

21
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,107
Well, now... Here, here, and here.

22
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,344
Wow, this apple pie sure
has a lot of apples in it!

23
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:23,015
Minako... Your sense of humor
is going downhill lately.

24
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:24,355
Yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:24,393 --> 00:01:27,021
Yup, she's right...

26
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:30,122
Hey, guys, do you know what happened
to the apple pie that was in the ove--

27
00:01:33,902 --> 00:01:37,133
The apple pie that I
took the effort to make...

28
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,929
T-This is...

29
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,908
...something we shouldn't have eaten?

30
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:43,502
H-How are you going to
take responsibility for this!?

31
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:46,844
Sheesh, Usagi!
You really are hopeless!

32
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:48,977
Don't worry...

33
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,348
In the name of Mars...

34
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:56,983
...I will chastise Usagi for you!

35
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,356
Ouch!

36
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:01,860
Y-Y-You traitor!

37
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,331
I wanted Masanori to eat this, too!

38
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:09,098
Who's Masanori?

39
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:15,267
T-That doesn't matter, does it!?
Oh, I have to get going now...

40
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:20,512
Usagi! I'll have you
make up for this later!!

41
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,477
Where did Chibiusa go?

42
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,420
I don't know, but lately,
she started going to art class...

43
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,084
...saying that she's
going to study sculpting...

44
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,558
I see...

45
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:35,029
Then maybe she made
a good friend there?

46
00:02:35,063 --> 00:02:38,897
Considering that she baked
such a delicious apple pie...

47
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:42,529
...perhaps she found someone that
she feels is more than just a friend?

48
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:45,538
Come to think, she mentioned
someone named Masanori...

49
00:02:46,274 --> 00:02:50,040
But should we really
eat all of this...?

50
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:53,379
It does no good to keep
it partially eaten.

51
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:55,815
We'll leave the rest
for Usagi to deal with.

52
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,349
Guess so.

53
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,819
You're kidding...

54
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:19,072
It's Masanori...

55
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:39,591
She's here...!

56
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:43,096
I wonder who he's waiting for?

57
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,598
M-Miss Michiru!

58
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:53,873
Oh, Masanori.

59
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,706
Hello.

60
00:03:55,744 --> 00:03:57,075
U-Um...

61
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,740
What's wrong?

62
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,749
T-These are a token of my affection...

63
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,512
Please accept them!

64
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:05,486
My, they're beautiful roses...

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,387
These flowers represent
passionate love.

66
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:12,886
I-Impossible!

67
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:18,161
I understand.

68
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,633
Thank you...

69
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:26,470
Oh, you were here too, Chibiusa?

70
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,741
Masanori and Chibiusa...

71
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,303
Let's hurry.

72
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:34,076
The class will begin soon.

73
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:36,242
S-Sure...

74
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,478
I won't let this get me down!!

75
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:56,201
Sheesh!

76
00:04:56,237 --> 00:05:00,105
Why do I have to watch
over how Chibiusa is doing!?

77
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:04,671
It's your fault for bringing
the apple pie over to us!

78
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:06,374
You have to take responsibility for it!

79
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:07,108
Yeah, yeah...

80
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,114
It's not going all that well...

81
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:17,181
Hey, Tsukino, what's that?
An urn?

82
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:19,284
No, it's a holy grail.

83
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:22,592
I saw a picture of it in my
mom's room. Just once, though...

84
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:24,622
It had a lot of gems on it.

85
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:29,433
I've always thought that
I wanted one just like it...

86
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,133
A holy grail, huh...?

87
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,898
Then it probably would be
better to do this here.

88
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,611
And about the gems...

89
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:42,879
If you stick on buttons, beads, and such,
I think it'd look more like a holy grail.

90
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:44,947
You're right.

91
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:47,386
You're as amazing
as I imagined, Masanori.

92
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:49,390
Nah, I'm not that great.

93
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,428
So that's the much-rumored Masanori.

94
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:59,399
What is that?
She's doing rather well there...

95
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:06,900
You're so wonderful, Masanori...

96
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:11,674
He really is the only one
who can be my friend after all.

97
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,546
So Michiru comes to
this school as well...

98
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,086
There seems to be a
painting class next door.

99
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,357
Masanori...

100
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:32,362
You shouldn't be helping Chibiusa
too much with her artwork...

101
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:35,097
Oh, y-you're right...

102
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,135
Do your best.

103
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:40,369
My dear little rivals...

104
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,244
What a wonderful person!

105
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,737
Michiru...
I haven't lost to you yet!!

106
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,984
I see... So that's what's going on...

107
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:55,716
Hey, what are you planning to do?

108
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:56,815
There's only one thing!

109
00:06:56,858 --> 00:07:01,795
I'm going to play matchmaker
between Chibiusa and Masanori!

110
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,009
Eugeal...

111
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:18,069
Yes, this is Chin-chin-tei.

112
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:21,480
Four ramens, was it? Hold on
just a little bit more for that...

113
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:25,484
I ask you to do your best.

114
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:37,258
Yes. Eugeal here...

115
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:39,260
Hello?

116
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:41,763
Hello...?

117
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,067
Eugeal...

118
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:46,971
Is something the matter?

119
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,499
There was quite a bit
of time lag there...

120
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:51,011
Nothing...

121
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:55,243
By the way, have you
found our next target?

122
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:59,284
Yes... I will send the reference
materials over to you now.

123
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:06,318
I see... It's a wonderful monument.

124
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,297
It is rather unbelievabIe that a
10-year-old boy created this piece...

125
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:14,233
Masanori Tsuzuki,
a prodigious artist of a boy.

126
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:18,137
His refined intuition and his pure
heart which keeps creating...

127
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:22,075
...more pieces, I believe,
must be holding onto a talisman...

128
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:24,044
I see.

129
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:29,072
This might finally become the first step
for us to get everything in our hands.

130
00:08:29,284 --> 00:08:34,916
I shall now create a Daimohn for you
that's best suited for this purpose...

131
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:57,902
Chokokkar!

132
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:26,400
I looked around this area.

133
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,376
It seems like Eugeal's group isn't
wandering around that much...

134
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:35,376
I see... then we can
relax this afternoon...

135
00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:37,875
Hey, where'd you get those flowers?

136
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:40,281
Does it bother you?

137
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,379
A little...

138
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:46,052
Is it a gift from your
boyfriend after all?

139
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:48,059
Of course...

140
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:49,890
Oh...?

141
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:54,800
I didn't know there was a guy clueless
enough to be your suitor, Michiru.

142
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:58,067
It's rather unusual that
you would be jealous, Haruka...

143
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:01,739
I'm not jealous at all...

144
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:05,576
It's just that I can't allow you
to look at anyone else, Michiru...

145
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:09,345
Haruka...
That's called jealousy.

146
00:10:10,952 --> 00:10:11,816
Chibiusa!

147
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:13,081
W-What is it!?

148
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,090
The cupid of love
makes its appearance!

149
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,092
Come on now...

150
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,557
What are you saying!?

151
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,958
Tsukino... Is she your older sister?

152
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,960
Yeah, something like that...

153
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,693
Nice to meet you, Masanori...

154
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:32,729
Please be good friends
with my little Chibiusa...

155
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:34,608
S-Sure...

156
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:37,042
Well, see you later!

157
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:38,636
See, Chibiusa?

158
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,740
I gave you an opening!
Go ask him out! Ask him out!!

159
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:44,283
Just go home!!

160
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:46,719
Do you want to be stomped on again!?

161
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:48,619
How scary!

162
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:56,756
Everyone, please calm down.
There's no reason to be alarmed.

163
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,265
W-What in the world are you!?

164
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:10,236
Captured!!

165
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,308
It seems...

166
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,785
...that this didn't end up
being a peaceful afternoon...

167
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:21,581
Don't say it so sorrowfully...

168
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:23,419
This is our important mission.

169
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,559
URANUS PLANET POWER...

170
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:28,892
MAKE UP!

171
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:44,140
NEPTUNE PLANET POWER...

172
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:46,578
MAKE UP!

173
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:08,534
This time, I'm sure it's a talisman...

174
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,733
You again!?

175
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,504
Dammit, I won't let
you get in the way!

176
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:18,341
Appear, Daimohn!

177
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:31,114
Chokokkar!

178
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,027
Now!

179
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:34,289
You can't, Chibiusa...

180
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:37,820
If you transform in a place like this,
they'll figure out your identity!

181
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:39,594
It's fine if I don't transform, right!?

182
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:44,527
H-How barbaric!

183
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:49,305
I won't let anyone have
the heart of my dear Masanori!!

184
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,376
T-Tsukino...

185
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:53,612
You're a bad girl...

186
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,139
Think about how much
troubIe you cause others!

187
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:57,742
The same can be said for you!

188
00:12:57,785 --> 00:12:59,616
Sheesh...

189
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:01,286
HEY!

190
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:05,088
Give back the crystal
for Masanori's heart!

191
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,821
Rest assured, little one...

192
00:13:06,861 --> 00:13:08,089
We'll return it to you soon.

193
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:11,587
This one wasn't a talisman, either...

194
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,029
I-I'm glad...

195
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:20,101
All right, I'm backing up!

196
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:22,868
I'll leave you to
do the rest, Chokokkar!

197
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,475
Chokokkar!

198
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,285
Fighting here is
a disadvantage to us...

199
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:35,619
It seems that way...

200
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:40,784
Wait CHO!

201
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,353
Oh, man...

202
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:47,299
Everyone left without
cleaning up this mess!

203
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:49,565
Don't just stand there, transform!

204
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:51,799
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

205
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:53,797
You're fine now...

206
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:57,140
Just stay here and lie still.

207
00:13:57,478 --> 00:14:00,311
I found her... My goddess...

208
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:03,340
MOON PRISM POWER...

209
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,875
MAKE UP!

210
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:15,259
MOON COSMIC POWER...

211
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:17,696
MAKE UP!

212
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:54,832
Oh, boy.

213
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:56,496
Such a powerless enemy...

214
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,943
Work #001.

215
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:09,540
"Beyond the Massacre"

216
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:12,519
Go! Art is to charge forth!

217
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:15,252
W-What!?

218
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,850
Uranus!

219
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:19,152
Work #002.

220
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:21,957
"The Ambition of Silence"

221
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:24,895
W-Wait a minute!

222
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:27,366
Make it a piece that's
easier to understand!!

223
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,866
This is avant-garde art!!

224
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,744
Stomping upon the divine heart of
art with your magic hands of evil...

225
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:48,846
...and on top of that,
putting my dear Masanori in danger!

226
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,447
We can't forgive you!

227
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,719
For love and justice...

228
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,784
...the pretty soldier
in a sailor suit!

229
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,625
Sailor Moon!

230
00:15:57,431 --> 00:16:00,889
In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

231
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:05,895
Same here... In the name of the moon
from the future, I'll punish you!

232
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:09,907
DOUBLE SAILOR MOON KICK!

233
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:15,809
H-Hey, get out of my way.

234
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,546
I can't move like this...

235
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:19,575
We're gonna be crushed!

236
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,930
It's dissolving...

237
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,938
I see... So that's how it is...

238
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:41,139
Uranus!

239
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:43,268
That piece's weakness is water!

240
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:44,608
I-I get it!

241
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:53,615
My artwork...

242
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,288
Now, you should prepare yourself.

243
00:16:56,324 --> 00:16:58,849
Isn't YOUR weakness water as well...?

244
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,756
DEEP...

245
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,395
...SUBMERGE!

246
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,402
Whew, we were saved.

247
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:15,306
Really!

248
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:17,470
How long are you going
to be on top of me!?

249
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,981
I should have used clay that
doesn't dissolve in water! CHO!

250
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,978
Now, both of you.
We're leaving you to finish it off.

251
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:27,153
I know that!

252
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:28,712
Leave it to us!

253
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:33,657
PINK SUGAR...

254
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:37,494
...HEART ATTACK!

255
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:46,764
Hey, what are you doing!?

256
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:49,241
T-There it goes!

257
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:50,503
All right!

258
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,529
MOON SPIRAL...

259
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:17,833
...HEART...

260
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:20,306
...ATTACK!

261
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:31,949
Lovely!!

262
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:44,560
We'll see both of you again...

263
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:46,065
Excuse us.

264
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:52,896
Those two are more reliable
than Sailor Moon after all...

265
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,805
Do you think you're in a position
right now to say that?!

266
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:05,882
Then, Tsukino...

267
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,515
You can call me Chibiusa, Masanori...

268
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:12,651
Well, um, I guess I'll see
you again in class, Chibiusa...

269
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,490
Yeah...

270
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,517
Oh, shoot...

271
00:19:15,563 --> 00:19:16,655
What?

272
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,824
Can you take this?

273
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,595
I just finished it...

274
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:23,095
Masanori... T-This is...

275
00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:24,269
See ya later.

276
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:27,103
Thank you, Masanori!!

277
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:30,599
You're enjoying your youth!

278
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:33,803
Chibiusa, you look so cool!

279
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:35,611
Y-You guys were watching!?

280
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:39,642
Chibiusa... You have to
thank me this one time.

281
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:43,623
Because of me, you were able
to be friends with Masanori...

282
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:45,252
You've got to be kidding.

283
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:48,090
Usagi, you were just
mocking the entire thing!

284
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:50,323
Yes, she did do just that...

285
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:51,422
That wasn't necessary...

286
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:52,693
But before that, guys...

287
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,998
What are you going to do about
the apple pie that I had made!?

288
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:58,866
You still remember!?

289
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:01,204
Of course!!

290
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,040
I-I'll bake you one next time...

291
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,511
That's not enough for me
to forgive you guys!

292
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:07,309
You do have a point...

293
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:10,010
But that was all Usagi's fault...

294
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,880
Yeah, I agree!

295
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,112
You guys...!!

296
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:16,054
Usagi, you really need
to repent for your crimes...

297
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,320
You guys all are so cruel!

298
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,520
Are you prepared to pay
the consequences, Usagi?

299
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:24,019
Please forgive me, my lord!

300
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:27,091
Hey, come down off of there!

301
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:31,298
- Please forgive me, Chibiusa!
- Hey! Come on!

302
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:38,298
