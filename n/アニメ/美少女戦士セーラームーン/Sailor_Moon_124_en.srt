1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:04,892
The time for the final
showdown has arrived.

2
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:06,364
We have to end it here!

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,802
We're the only ones who can
stop the approaching silence!

4
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:11,701
That's right...

5
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:14,205
I won't hand them over!
I will protect them!

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,835
Chibiusa, Hotaru, AND the world!

7
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:27,487
All preparations are complete.

8
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:39,324
Now if you, the Messiah of Silence,
sets the Grail onto this device...

9
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:43,362
...the light of shadow will
shine upon the Tau Nebula.

10
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:47,273
To guide our great master...

11
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,747
...the energy life form from
another dimension, Pharaoh 90.

12
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:54,545
We need that light.

13
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:59,148
When Pharaoh 90
appears in this universe...

14
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,888
...everything will be destroyed and
the Earth will be surrounded in silence.

15
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:12,233
The age of light filled with lies will end...

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,303
...and the age of shadows where true
darkness reigns supreme will begin!

17
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:43,028
We have to end it here.

18
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:43,964
Yes...

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,991
To save Chibiusa, too.

20
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:48,937
And we won't let Hotaru die, either!

21
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:52,499
We are Sailor Soldiers
of love and justice!

22
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:55,772
Guys!

23
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:02,182
Wait for us, Chibiusa, Hotaru...

24
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:06,921
MERCURY STAR POWER...

25
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,058
MARS STAR POWER...

26
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:21,869
JUPITER STAR POWER...

27
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,374
VENUS STAR POWER...

28
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:37,017
MOON COSMIC POWER...

29
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,884
MAKE UP!!

30
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,242
We have no time left...

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,273
We have to strike before
she completely awakens.

32
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:15,215
So there was no Messiah after all.

33
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:18,056
We have to save the
world with our own hands.

34
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:21,029
No matter what sacrifice
we have to make...

35
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:33,538
I won't let anybody be sacrificed!

36
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:44,279
The Grail is approaching...

37
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:46,647
The Grail is!?

38
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:51,620
They are foolishly bringing it to us...

39
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:55,721
That's good for us.

40
00:03:57,934 --> 00:04:03,201
But I still cannot allow...
obstructions to... enter.

41
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,402
Not until I am fully awakened...

42
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,050
Mars...?

43
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:15,642
What's wrong?

44
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:16,879
Just now...

45
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,754
I felt a presence so
silent that it was eerie...

46
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:30,528
What?

47
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:10,866
A dark energy of immense levels!

48
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:15,343
To get through that barrier,
we have to use the Sailor Teleport.

49
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:18,370
All right, then let's do it.

50
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:45,838
They're coming!

51
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:53,914
SPARKLING...

52
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,713
...WI DE PRESSURE!

53
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:56,741
CRESCENT...

54
00:05:56,786 --> 00:05:58,083
...BEAM!

55
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,518
BURNING...

56
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:03,389
...MANDALA!

57
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,258
Just how many are there!?

58
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:10,763
This is endless!

59
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,765
At this rate, we can't
use the Sailor Teleport!

60
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:16,269
Give us a break! Sheesh!

61
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:40,486
MOON SPIRAL...

62
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,431
...HEART...

63
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:45,866
...ATTACK!

64
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:52,200
LOVELY!!

65
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:01,643
It's no good...

66
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:04,646
What in the world can we do...?

67
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:12,927
Amazing!

68
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,834
Mugen Academy is now an
omega-zone protected by dark energy...

69
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:24,272
Now, no one will be able to
step inside this sacred ground.

70
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:27,734
Now...

71
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:29,768
The Grail...

72
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,782
FIRE SOUL!

73
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:38,013
BUBBLE SPRAY!

74
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:41,288
Oh, no!

75
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:43,121
MOON SPIRAL...

76
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,456
...HEART...

77
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:46,894
...ATTACK!

78
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:49,561
Now's the time to teleport!

79
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:07,178
Sailor Moon!

80
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:09,247
Stop it!

81
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:10,411
Hang on!

82
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:28,932
She's gone...

83
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:31,496
Sailor Moon...

84
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:00,461
Can this be really happening...?

85
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:06,169
If Sailor Moon has been captured,
we can't use the Sailor Teleport...

86
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:09,269
Then, what should we do...?

87
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:15,273
What is that...?

88
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:19,449
It looks like it's no ordinary barrier.

89
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:23,453
Can we enter through that hole?

90
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,405
Dammit!

91
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,388
This is...?

92
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:30,386
Pluto...

93
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:32,621
What did you do...?

94
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,889
I have stopped time.

95
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:39,260
Now, please go now.

96
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:43,170
You had hidden this
much power even from us...?

97
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:44,173
No...

98
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:49,907
This is the greatest taboo that I
cannot break as the guardian of time...

99
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:52,607
The greatest taboo...?

100
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:54,775
What will happen to you?

101
00:10:56,119 --> 00:11:00,283
If you are able to
meet the real Messiah...

102
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,119
If we are...?

103
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,094
Pluto...!

104
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:28,707
To enter by stopping time...

105
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:32,054
Nothing less from the soldiers of
the outer rim of the solar system...

106
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:38,459
But more than that, your power is
sincerely grand, oh Messiah of Silence.

107
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:43,932
This is all thanks to taking in the pure
heart of that sacrifice named Chibiusa.

108
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:47,332
Don't use that pure heart...

109
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,203
...for bad things...

110
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:54,837
Is something the matter?

111
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:56,336
Nothing is wrong!!

112
00:12:10,026 --> 00:12:13,621
I will get a hold of the Grail now...

113
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:17,155
I want you to get rid of the Sailor
Soldiers that have gotten in here.

114
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,895
Me?

115
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:23,298
Use the dolls that you created...

116
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,399
Go, Daimohn Germatoid.

117
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,407
Yes...

118
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,844
That wall is continuing
its increase in energy.

119
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:40,412
To think we can't go in...

120
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:41,923
Sailor Moon...

121
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:44,588
All the four of us can do...

122
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:47,255
...is merely prevent that
wall from getting any bigger.

123
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:51,860
We need to believe
in Sailor Moon... and...

124
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:54,870
...and do what ever we can do!

125
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:56,269
Yeah!

126
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:46,579
Sailor Moon...

127
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,598
Where is everyone...?

128
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:08,109
Hotaru...!

129
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:16,614
What's this...!?

130
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:21,253
This is...

131
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,691
These are... bodies that I have created...

132
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:31,630
Both of you... it's against
school rules to come in here.

133
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:37,634
Go forth for your own justice...
these are your words, chairman.

134
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,273
It's a shame.

135
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:45,679
I wanted superior students like you
to become bodies for Daimohns...

136
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:49,173
Just like this man, Soichi Tomoe...

137
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:09,332
So he was possessed by a Daimohn!!

138
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:14,469
WORLD...

139
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,842
...SHAKING!

140
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:39,390
It's no use.

141
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:42,199
I've already analyzed all your attacks.

142
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:45,366
You can't win against me.

143
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:52,879
DEEP...

144
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:54,439
...SUBMERGE!

145
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:36,789
TALISMAN!

146
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:45,397
W-What!?

147
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,406
W-What's going on!?

148
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:24,333
Uranus!

149
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:50,930
I thought I heard Pluto's voice...

150
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:52,866
Yeah...

151
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:59,135
The Death Busters are
tougher than we thought...

152
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:02,008
But we won't lose...

153
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:12,146
Hotaru...

154
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:16,088
T-The Grail...

155
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,958
Grail? What about the Grail?

156
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:21,827
I overheard...

157
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:26,233
...that if Super Sailor Moon let
the Grail shine in this room...

158
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:29,396
...all enemies would be obliterated...

159
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,737
If you don't hurry,
the enemy will be here...

160
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:44,517
I'm glad you're all right, Hotaru...

161
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:47,247
Y-Yes...

162
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:51,492
Now, please hurry, Usagi.

163
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:55,429
Hurry and use the Grail
for Chibiusa's sake as well...

164
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:01,197
Hotaru...

165
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:04,934
How do you know
that I'm Usagi Tsukino?

166
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:11,704
You're... not Hotaru.

167
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:14,542
I'm Hotaru...

168
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,710
But, just in body.

169
00:19:18,988 --> 00:19:22,014
What happened to Hotaru!?

170
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,650
I took her inside my body.

171
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:29,693
I am a life form
from another dimension.

172
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:34,999
I came here from the Tau Nebula
and took over Hotaru Tomoe's body.

173
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:37,665
I am Mistress Nine.

174
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:42,672
We've finally found you!!

175
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:48,112
For the future of this planet,
we will defeat you!

176
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:51,619
Wait! Uranus! Neptune!!

177
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:11,368
Master Pharaoh 90...

178
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:13,204
Please wait just a while longer.

179
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:20,204
