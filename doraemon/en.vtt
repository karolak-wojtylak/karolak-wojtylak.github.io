WEBVTT

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.170
Nobita!

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.060
I'm late!

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.140
What a mess!

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.620
Next, mystery on the moon.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.310
Japan lunar rover "Nayotake",
that was sent to the moon.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.150
Captured a white shadow on camera.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.860
Here is the footage.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.590
While investigating the surface.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.150
A glimpse of white shadow appeared.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.560
This is the last frame,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.130
before Nayotake stop transmitting completely.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.690
According to experts,
Solar flare blocked the signal.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.340
Just now, is that...

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.610
Nobita!

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.360
Do you even have time for this!?

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.930
Yes ma'am!   I'm going!

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.190
Must be Alien.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.770
-ALIEN!
-He's right!

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.150
A dirt on the lens!
-That's right!

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.180
Spiritual organism!

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.320
What nonsense is that!?

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.600
It has to be Alien!

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.360
Made it in time...

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.640
Nobita?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.640
What's going on?

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.040
Discussing recent news, about the moon.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.330
No biggie.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.680
Um

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.420
-I said it's Alien!
-Ahem!

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.730
The true identity
of the mysterious white shadow is...

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.320
The moon rabbit!

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.260
Huh?!   Why?

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.560
They lives on moon too.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.940
Make rice cake, like this...

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.240
That hurt...

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.010
Nobi!

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.610
Stand in the hallway!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.050
Good morning students.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.220
Do...   Do...

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.690
Doraemon!

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.130
I'm always, always picturing it in my heart.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.250
Doraemon Movie - Nobita's Chronicle of the moon Exploration

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.620
A world map of my own
where my dreams comes true.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.480
Bamboo Copter!

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.700
Fly across the sky,
travel through time even to places far away.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.110
I want to open the door and go there right now.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.080
Anywhere Door!

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.580
Will I forget when I become an adult?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:33.600
If that ever happens, I'll look back and remember.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.520
Sha-la-la-la In my heart.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.470
Dreams that shines forever.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:49.060
Doraemon, make them come true with that pocket of yours.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.180
Sha-la-la-la Let's sing a song.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.090
Everybody hand in hand.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.280
Doraemon fill the world,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.180
Yes, fill the world with dreams.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.760
Rabbit on the moon?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.720
Sounds like Nobita.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.920
Even Doraemon makes fun of me!

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.350
Fine!

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.930
Let everyone mocks me.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.430
Even adult,

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.050
said there are rabbits on the moon

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.100
Since when they disappeared?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.700
I have to see it with my own eyes.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.830
I believe rabbit still lives on the moon.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.780
Well, I guess...

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.860
You're not the only one
thinking like that.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.500
Huh?

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.110
Theory Badge!

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.040
Theory?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.030
We live in a world
with a lot of different thinking.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.050
Whoever wear this badge,
will experience the same kind of thinking.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.120
Different thinking?

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.450
For example.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.020
Earth is spherical and revolve around the Sun.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.310
This is common knowledge, right?

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.110
Even for Nobita.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.680
You don't have to put it that way!

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.110
Calm down.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.100
however in the past,
this Heliocentric model

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.350
thought to be wrong.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.140
They even believe,

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.470
The earth is flat
and it's the center of Universe.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.400
The sun, moon and others
revolve around the earth

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.340
It's known as Geocentric model

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.280
People in the past is so silly.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.960
Didn't even realize how silly you are.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.470
Geocentric is correct!

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.010
Huh?

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.670
Wear this badge.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.090
Um?

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.270
Now!   Let's go see the edge of the world!

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.370
Whoa!

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.370
It affects whoever wears the badge.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.020
Meaning, only members of the Theory Badge,

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.910
will experience the world as Geocentric.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.690
No!  That ship will sink!

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.600
Don't worry.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.420
Other people still in Heliocentric world.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.440
Try to remove the badge.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.950
Turns out, it's just the ocean.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.070
That was fun!

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.720
Hey, what if

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.930
There are people who believe in
Tsuchinoko and Yeti.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.800
Could they exist, if we try it?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.370
Sure, but....

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.800
I'm not lending these gadgets
just to play around.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.780
What was it for again?

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.300
You're tired being mock
for believing in moon Rabbit.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.190
Ah, that's right.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.480
As I said.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.190
You're not the only one
who thinks like that.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.110
People once believe there's a civilization
on the back side of the moon

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.090
Realistic Miniature Encyclopedia.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.570
Moon rotation and revolution, please!

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.140
That's the sun,
and here we have earth and moon.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.890
The moon only shows its front surface,

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:42.090
So when a rocket fly by the moon,
they don't know the state of the back side.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.670
Believing there's atmosphere on its back,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.350
There are people who think moon civilization exist.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.050
That sounds fun!

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.790
We should believe in moon Civilization too.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.370
Let's do it!

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.010
Atmosphere on the back side of the moon!

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.820
Beings could live there!

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.320
No need to wear a spacesuit.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.930
The gravity is the same as earth.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.720
Whoa!

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.250
Is that earth?

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.920
On the edge of moon's back.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.500
It's already night in here.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.590
The night time is a lot longer than earth.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.370
I want to sleep plenty over here too.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.430
Ugh!

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.070
But, the rabbit is nowhere to be seen.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.120
Also...

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.810
It's too dark and cold!?

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.590
I'll make it bright.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.370
Sparkling Moss!

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.030
Spread a little, it will cover the surface.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.630
Whoa, it's brighter!

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.180
This moss is fine, but how about other greenery.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.160
Let's make this place more inhabitable.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.120
Let's build Rabbit Kingdom on that crater.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.670
In order to grow plant,
other than air and sunlight,

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.650
Water is necessary.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.160
Anywhere Faucet!

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.410
Water is set!

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.090
Next we...

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.080
Scatter these Instant-Plant seeds.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.080
What kind of plant?

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.060
Look forward until it grows.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.310
Amazing! The sprouts already grow.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.280
For finishing touch...

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.660
Launch A Dome!

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.970
Make some space.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.980
If by chance a meteor strike,

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.520
this dome will protect the kingdom.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.680
Doraemon, let's create some rabbit.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.350
Coming right up!

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.480
Animal Clay!

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.440
Rabbit!   Rabbit!

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.740
Rabbit!   Rabbit!

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.240
Done!

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.960
Let's see...

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.130
Wha...

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.080
Monster?

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.830
Um...

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.150
Start from scratch.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.260
Perfect!

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.880
Looks pretty good

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.700
We have to name it,
moon rabbit become...

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.020
Moon and rabbit...

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.760
How about moonbit!

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.920
Like it!

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.790
Moonbit it is.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.030
They move!

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.500
Moon's Adam and Eve

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.990
Want to show them to Suneo and Gian?

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.370
I think...

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.880
Wait until the kingdom is established.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.320
They'll be more surprised.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.590
That could work,
let's head back for now!

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.080
Take care of the kingdom.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.540
With this, the Rabbit Kingdom will complete.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.990
To finished faster, we should help too.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.560
Right!

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.700
Nobita, Doraemon.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.200
What?  Right now?!

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.380
It's the full moon viewing ceremony,

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.720
We need to prepare the dumpling
and susuki grass decoration

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.330
Um... I'll buy the dumpling.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.920
Hey wait!

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.730
Nobita gather 5-6 Susuki grass.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.590
I don't know where to look.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.850
They should grow on the back hill.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.170
It's too far...

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.010
Doraemon probably take his chance,
to buy some dorayaki too.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.950
Huh?

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.140
Hey!

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.170
You came here to pick some grass too?

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.940
Wha?

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.050
How lovely.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.280
Even in the past,

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.620
People admire the moon as we do.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.750
Mysterious.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:09.770
Even though tale of moon princess Kaguya
have passed 1000 years.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.910
Someday, maybe we could travel to the moon.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.800
Doraemon.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.080
Don't just eat, how about enjoy the view.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.560
But I've seen enough moon already.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.700
Not thoroughly yet, right?.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.490
That's not what I meant,
I just went there and Nobita...

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.920
Stop talk nonsense, Doraemon.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.920
Let's just gaze at the moon.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.130
-Yes ma'am.
-Good grief.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.840
Good morning student.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.040
Good morning!.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.860
Oh no, homeroom already start.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.880
Today, we have transfer student.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.970
Please introduce yourself.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.410
Tsukino Luca, Please to meet you.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.310
He's the guy from before.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.880
What's with him, covering himself with that hat.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.240
True, what a weirdo.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.170
Your table is on the back.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.580
Yes,

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.410
Let's tackle him.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.590
Huh

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.520
Wh-What?

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.560
What are you two doing?

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.500
That light...

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.890
Is Nobita late again?

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.560
On your mark.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.100
Get set.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.840
So fast!

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.770
That's incredible Luca!

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.010
Must be special training!

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.360
He's our running ace.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.870
Want to join my baseball team?

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.190
-Look out!
-Run away!

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.430
Maybe I didn't water it enough.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:30.780
Huh!?

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.150
Luca.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.630
How's your first day?

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.570
Different from your previous school?

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.510
Previous school?

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.460
-Ah!
-Uh?

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.980
I get it...

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.990
I have a great time in here too.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.290
I see...

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.260
Look! Look!

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.970
The rabbit dance.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.870
Cutesy  Cutesy
Childlike.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.890
The moon rabbit is real!

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.120
Then show us some proof!

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.400
Proof!

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.860
Bullying again.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.400
Don't you think, there's life on the moon?

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.250
Ah, it's a pretty interesting dream.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.040
But I don't think it's possible to live there.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.370
I see...

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.920
I won't take your apologize later!

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.260
Doraemon!

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.720
I'm curious about our Rabbit Kingdom.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.350
Okay, how about we take a look.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.150
To the back of the moon!

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.980
Yeah!

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.610
Before that.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.640
Wear the badge.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.710
Right.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.260
Depart!

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.670
Yeah!

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.150
Oh, earth also have turtle...

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.520
I see...

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.880
Earth's language is simple.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.090
I'll master it in no time.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.240
Ah... Don't scare me like that.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.000
Why!?

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.100
The turtle slow?

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.000
They should know how fast my feet are.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.340
-Mozo!
-Right!

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.600
Yes, I'll be quiet.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.940
Ah... ! Ha...!

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.440
The moon!?

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.800
Luca!  Hurry, close the door!

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.240
Huh?

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.300
Ah...

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.050
Hey, Mozo isn't this great.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.040
I'm sure that kid could...

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.360
Nobita!

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.960
You're back?

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.120
Mozo!

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.380
You should said "I'm Home".

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.180
What?

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.070
Gone play already?

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.260
Even though his snack
is prepared already.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.070
Snack huh...

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.440
What is it, Luca?

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.190
Nothing it's fine.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.190
Amazing! Lake and land is formed.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.020
Let's explore the land.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.610
Yeah!

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.880
The bamboo create a light.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.540
They just the moss.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.950
Enveloping the seed that we plant.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.120
I see...

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.750
But where's our precious moonbit.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.470
Um...

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.360
Ah!

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.840
Over there!

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.600
-It got away!
-Wait!

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.460
Hey!

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.230
Did they forget about us?

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.110
Ah...!

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.000
Where is it gone to?

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.020
Do.. Doreaemon!

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.590
-There!
-What?

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.330
Children are born.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.230
So cute...

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.730
This hole is not enough.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.630
Let's teach them to build a house.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:06.810
Good idea!

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.890
Connect the bamboo,

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.220
and cover it in leaves.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.240
Good grief.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.450
Teach them to lit a fire too.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.980
The moonbits are gathering.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.380
No need to fear, handle it carefully.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.600
What?

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.680
Rice Cake Pounding Set.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.520
That's good!

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.470
Moon rabbit, really cut out for this job.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.490
Looks tasty, thanks.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.310
Where's my share?

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.200
I help created you too.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.980
What's the big idea!

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.880
Return my glasses!

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.560
They develop interest in human belongings too.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.460
What!?

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.930
Only Doraemon treated as deity, not fair!

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.480
Emperor Diabolo, I have return.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.060
Commander Godat.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.860
Still haven't found Espal?

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.320
W-we thoroughly search for them,

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.570
from every possible location, yet...

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.140
Surely there are other ways to locate it.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.850
The result from Ether-Radar
which I grant you to use?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.160
Unfortunately, even this radar
couldn't locate their existence.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.620
Watch your words!

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.600
Ah!

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.550
Ugh...

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.430
Forgive my rudeness.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:40.570
Listen! this planet could be saved,
using Espal's ether power.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:45.560
Capture these Espal at once!
and bring them to me!

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.290
This is your last chance.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.520
My lord.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.490
Commander Godat,
what did Emperor Diabolo said?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.360
For us disposable unit,

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.880
This is the last chance.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.260
But commander.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.000
Is Espal really do exist?

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.360
Maybe these creature really are just some myth.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.320
According to it,
they will emerge as savior.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.720
These savior might be just normal people.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.620
They have demon like feature,
nothing normal about it.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.880
Whichever is true,
it's not our responsibility if we can't find them.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.530
Don't say that.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.630
The search for Espal is still our duty.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.500
Myth or not.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.320
There must be some truth to it.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.380
The time for the prophecy is near.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.170
Huh?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.900
Time to depart!

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.820
Yes sir!

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.330
Show us already!

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.930
I don't need anything worthless.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.140
Here it is!

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.510
I present you.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.940
Invitation pass
to the moon Rabbit Kingdom!

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.270
What did you mean?

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.150
Rabbits really live in that kingdom?

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.040
There's no way.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.690
No one could live on the moon.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.220
Don't limit yourself to that thinking.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.400
Let me join too.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:31.260
What?

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.100
Tsukino Luca.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.070
No need to be so formal.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.260
More importantly.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.080
I'm curious about this kingdom?

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.650
Welcome!

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.360
Sup!

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.770
Excuse us.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.600
You should clean your room.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.310
Shut up!

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.080
And you are?

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.360
Luca a transfer student, he interested to join.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.730
Please to meet you.

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.520
I'm Doraemon.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.030
Give him the badge.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.350
Sure thing!

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.600
Members only.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.070
Ready the badge?

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.520
Wear it!

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.020
Mine too!

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.550
Well then...

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.280
To the moon kingdom!

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.830
Whoa!

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.570
This is Rabbit Kingdom?

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.920
Simillar to princess Kaguya fantasy.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.140
Liar!

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.870
moon's gravity should be weaker than earth.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.630
Now that you mention it.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.860
No need to fuss about it.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:09.360
-R...Rabbit!?
-No way!

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.560
Cute!

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.950
Good job greeting our guests.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.040
Are you guys healthy?

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.250
Only Doraemon treated as deity again.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.590
The town grow rapidly.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.050
Huge development.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.960
Look! Celebration paper, so many of them.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.900
They celebrate by welcoming us.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.800
Huh? Gian!

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:19.690
What?

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.160
They use rice cake as brick for building.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.890
Is that rice cake concrete?

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.060
Somehow I'm getting hungry.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.550
Huh?

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.210
Whoa!

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.260
Amazing feast!

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.900
Thank you for the meal!

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.550
Delicious!

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.420
Bamboo straw and carrot smoothie.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.440
Yum!

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.560
Rice cake is good with ice cream.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.560
Let me try.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:20.810
Hey, hey.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.180
Why don't we go to that carrot like tower.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:27.710
Ouch.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.000
Ugh, be careful.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.010
This one looks like Nobita.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.400
You're right, they careless is the same.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.480
Let's call it NObit.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.310
Good one!

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.730
Aren't you...

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.080
The one who curious about my glasses.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.950
Did he made that himself?

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.290
Let me take a look.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.140
What's this... It's so hard to see.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.910
Glasses supposed to make you see clearer.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.470
This reverse the effect.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.610
I know!

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.270
NObit.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.000
Would you care to be our guide?

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:17.530
Please!

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.350
Easy to persuade.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.200
You forgot your book.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.700
NObit fits him well.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.360
Hey-Hey Hey-Hey,
the rabbit dance.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.410
Hop-Hop Hop-Hop and move.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:46.720
Move your legs and dance along.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:51.020
Brace yourself and follow along.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:07.100
Follow along this
adorable dance.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.520
Hop-Hop Hop-Hop and move.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.170
Leap and do more hopping.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.560
Hop-Hop till you can't move anymore.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.340
Whoa!

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.030
Do the dance!

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.090
That was fun!

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.120
Thanks NObit.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.260
Rabbit Kingdom is the best!

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.770
But it's strange,
these rabbit on moon.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.590
Who cares!

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:45.000
Anyone who don't believe it,
could face me!

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.190
Okay, stop!
I just have to believe it.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.720
Yeah!

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.700
My theory proof to be right.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.440
How come on the moon,
a kingdom like this exist?

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.950
Actually, it's the power of that badge.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:04.370
Apart from the truth,
this world filled with theory as well.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.540
that badge, makes a theory real.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.050
Doraemon's gadgets after all.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.380
No wonder this is strange.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.040
How dreamy it is,

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.040
Moon rabbit could become real.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.410
Could this badge make anything real?

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:29.940
No, only a theory that persistently believed for quiet some time could become real.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.560
This isn't a gadget that make
someone wish come true.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:36.400
Is that so...

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.510
Everyone listen,

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.400
Air present here, because of the badge.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.420
You can't breathe if it's removed.

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.530
So do not take it off!

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.710
Scary!

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:54.330
Anyone without the badge can't see this kingdom?

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.460
NObit presence too?

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.720
Yes

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.320
They can't see anything the badge materialize.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.290
What's with the commotion?

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:40.810
Sports event?

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.860
Ah, that one!

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.330
Rabbit monster that i created.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.320
NObit!

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.120
This is bad!

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.670
It's dangerous, wait here Luca!

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.950
Hey...! Let NObit go!

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:30.030
Oh no!
Super Glove!

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.920
Just in time.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.150
Nobita is gone.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.200
NObit!

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.000
Bamboo copter?

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:18.410
Hiii...!

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.350
Give back NObit!

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:41.840
Would you mind.... give.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.880
What is that?

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.440
Urgh!  Ha...

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.600
Ah!

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.750
Aa...!

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.040
Sniff...Sniff
ah!

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.420
Here!

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.490
Nobita scent stop here.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.400
I don't see him.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:32.760
That gadget is not helping.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.850
Have more faith in this
K9 nose!

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.150
Isn't this Nobita's copter?

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.800
Nobita definitely headed that way.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.250
Why this monster here, instead of Nobita.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:58.030
At time like this,
Dumpling Tamer... out of stock.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.080
I know!

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.230
Forgotten Scent!

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:07.550
If you smell this weed, you'll forgot something.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:13.240
Why @m I doing here?

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:14.160
Stop it!

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.800
Careless!

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.070
Stop being so violent.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.980
From now on, be nice to everyone.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.690
What have I done?

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.010
Nothing at all.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:43.680
-Isn't that
NObit!

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.040
This place?

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.880
My badge's gone!

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.980
I... I can't breathe.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:00.190
Suffocate...

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:01.940
Don't panic.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.830
It's okay,
breathe normally.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.060
Light from before!

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.300
There's air.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.250
Aren't you...

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:22.940
This is...

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.130
Nobita's badge.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.700
This means he got no air...

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:33.180
Nobita!

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:34.420
Can't be!

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.280
Are we too late!?

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:40.070
Of course not!
I'm sure Nobita still...

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.330
I'm gonna repent by ending myself!

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.510
Doraemon!

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.440
Don't do this!

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.550
Hey...!

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.120
Doraemon!

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.910
That's definitely Nobita's voice.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.870
I'm glad he's okay.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.440
That pipsqueak.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:04.640
Without badge, how did he breathe?

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.870
Let's head down first.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.130
We're descending pretty deep.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:20.760
Trench like this inside the moon...

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.680
Hey!

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:25.070
The voice coming from here.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.490
The surface is rugged, be care...

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.890
Doraemon!

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.990
Ouch...

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.750
You guys all right?

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:45.760
Huh?

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.890
Nobita!

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.860
Glad you're okay, Hooray!

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.170
Hurray!  Hurray!

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:55.530
Hey, everyone.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.810
Welcome, to our colony.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.870
Luca!?

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.530
Why are you here?

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.240
I think these will explain it.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.390
Wa...!

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:16.500
Sorry for not telling the truth.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.410
R..Rabbit!?

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:24.410
It's the first time we have a guest.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.460
Turtle!?

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.020
Greetings.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.010
I'm Tsukino turtle, Mozo.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.170
Please to make your acquintance.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.270
From the moon world.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.080
Aside from rabbit.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.210
There's turtle too!?

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.840
Brother Luca!

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.160
I'm back everyone.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.720
Where did you go?

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.470
Weird clothes.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.000
Hey...

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.640
Luca, you can't just went off like that.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.980
You worry too much.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.560
We have guests from earth.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.280
Excuse us.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.710
Please to meet you

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.660
From earth!?

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.160
Must be quite a journey, enjoy your stay.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.780
I'm Luca's big sister, Luna.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.170
My brother,
didn't force you to be here right?

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.980
Of course not.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.840
I'm Doraemon!

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.170
This is once a passage for moon's magma.

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.890
We construct this lava cave
to become colony.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.380
Are you guys moon's dweller?

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.030
You're not exactly wrong.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.340
We came from a distant place.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.610
We're a creature came from planet Kaguya.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:58.250
Then Kaguya-Being?

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.660
Not that either...

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:05.480
We are created by "Father and Mother."

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:11.260
They are known on Kaguya planet
as an outstanding scholar.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.530
Dr.Godal spouses.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:18.840
Luca and other here are called Espal
and only 11 people in total.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.540
Espal!?

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.580
Luna.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:22.550
Okay.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.100
What's happening?

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.920
The flowers are dancing.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:37.530
Whoa!

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:38.630
This is ether.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.190
An energy come from our body.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:48.190
Could make plant flourish
to even moving an object.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:54.990
Wrap ourselves on ether,
we could easily moving on space.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.030
Amazing, psychic abilities?

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.760
You ran fast because of this?

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:03.150
And restore that wither flower?

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.530
Sorry if that surprised you.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.920
Luca did that?

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.560
Please forgive his behavior.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.350
How are you able to speak our language?

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.520
We use telepathy to read someone's mind then translate.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.780
All I see is children.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:26.190
The adults?

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:30.520
Espal's body stopped aging
at a young period of time.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.240
That's why nobody looks old.

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:37.600
Wait a minute, then your real age?

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:40.880
Adding 10 years from planet Kaguya to be here, so...

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:43.840
Roughly 1010 years old.

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.780
1010!?

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.400
Super old dude!

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:51.460
Anyone want to live that long!

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:53.360
Is that so...

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:58.410
By the way I'm 2000 Years Old,
we turtle have long lifespan.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:01.150
At first we planned to live on earth.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:04.220
And already did some scouting, but...

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.130
Civilazation already taken place,
so we choose the moon instead

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:12.250
1000 years ago, Japan still in Heian era.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.330
Maybe legend of princess moon is...

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:17.840
Ah, that would be me!

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.190
Wha!

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.270
It's an honor
to be called princess.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:28.760
A place like this inside the moon...

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.340
How come there's soil and air?

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:33.930
We brought the soil from earth?

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.810
Air was made from moon's ice.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.090
Ice?

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:40.060
Come, I'll show you.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.900
What's the matter?

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:48.920
Ether energy is all they need to have an abundant life.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:53.860
There must be some reason for them
to leave their planet.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.770
Spaceship from planet Kaguya?

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.220
Yes, we rode this to came here.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:08.230
It packed with Liquid nitrogen.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.620
Surrounded by these ice,
could create atmosphere.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:16.940
No wonder Nobita was safe,
even without badge.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.850
-What is that?
-tremor?

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.250
Ba!

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.060
Welcome back brother Luca.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.600
It's not safe!
Going here by yourself.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.080
But!

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:37.040
Sister Luna always scold me,
when I sing in the house.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.340
Ha?

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:40.500
Who are they?

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.590
It's okay, they're guests from earth.

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:49.130
Hey, was that your voice?
could you do it again?

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.940
Okay?

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.070
If it's only a little.

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:54.300
Then.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.860
Al's power is a bit unique.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.490
I think we have a person with the same power.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.720
So cool!

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.790
A genius!

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.300
Want to debut together as singer?

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.510
What!?

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.810
Nice scent!

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:29.030
Tea brewed from moon's flower.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.440
Thanks.

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.610
Ba!

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.090
Ha?

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:41.900
Are they the "Father and mother?"

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.330
They don't have rabbit's ear.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.620
These are not ear.

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.130
Some kind of antenna to control ether energy.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.520
And we aren't real parent and child.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:46:59.680
I see.

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:04.250
Hey, about that white shadow on the news.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.940
That was Al going to the surface.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.890
He almost caught on camera, we have no choice.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.010
Because!

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.700
I'm out to see a shooting star,
as prophecy predicted.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:15.860
Prophecy?

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.910
Al have other power.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.370
Predict the future trough prophecy.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.460
Ha!?

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.930
Is that true!?

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:25.080
Ah!

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.910
Let your prophecy read my future.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.700
-No!
-What?

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.030
Behave!

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.410
He unable to use that power at will.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.580
The prophecy just appear itself.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.970
By the way, why did you decided
to transfer to Nobita's school?

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:46.410
Come to think of it...

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:50.300
Human began to observe the back of the moon.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:54.500
Sooner or later we have to
introduce ourselves.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.050
It won't be easy to convince Adult.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.230
Children might believe our existance.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.960
I'm certain of it, when I met Nobita.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:08.250
Nobita even believe there's moon rabbit.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.110
I think that's lovely.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.630
Nobita's imagination, lead to this encounter.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.370
Shizuka!

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.570
Shizuka is right.

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.920
When Galileo talk about heliocentric,

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.190
Nobody believe his thinking to be true.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:29.600
But now, his theory is accepted.

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:34.340
Civilization was build upon different theory.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.560
But there's one cruel theory.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.510
Turtle isn't slower than rabbit.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.850
Didn't they know how fast my feet are!?

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:45.680
No one knows.

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.850
Ha?

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:53.740
Space Cart!

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:01.690
Let's form a team,
and race on the moon.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.660
Yeah!

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:09.470
On your mark.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.340
Get set.

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:14.830
Go!

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.880
GO!  GO!

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:24.320
Those vehicle might be able to match my speed.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.840
No!

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.440
"Safe"

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.610
"Safe," my ass!

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:38.600
If not because of my super sturdy shell,

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.360
I would have been in pieces.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.430
Is this your vehicle?

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.600
It looks old fashioned.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.890
But built pretty well.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:56.010
All right, why don't you let me handle it.

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:59.040
Moving forward!

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.450
Oh my!

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:03.010
Why moving backwards!?

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.180
The function is reversed!

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.420
Even the steer!

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:14.120
Jeez!

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:17.480
Our cart is the only one that slow.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.660
Ah... this is relaxing

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:26.300
I always wanted to visit earth.

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:29.200
Everyone thinks it's dangerous.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.310
So I always gaze upon it from here.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.680
You must be longing for a friend.

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:42.760
Friend?   What is a friend?

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.200
What!?  You don't know?

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.380
Even with everyone in the colony?

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.570
Yes

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:54.860
Friend is companion
where you could share your feelings.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.410
Understand each other sadness.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.860
Celebrate together too.

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:05.600
A friends will always there to help you.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.040
Friend huh...

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.370
Please replace the battery.

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:27.180
Good grief.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.970
Doraemon's gadgets always breaking up like this.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.850
Could you fix it?

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:38.160
I'm sure it's not hard to replace a battery.

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:48.430
Maybe here?  let's try open it up.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.780
I think I could...

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.310
-Luca
-Ha?

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:59.310
Do you remember about father and mother?

00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:03.700
I'm not sure...

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:08.680
It's been 1000 years since we left.

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:14.960
After we left,
they probably forgot about us.

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:16.800
I don't think so.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.870
Even without real connection.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.020
They're still your parents.

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.640
So I'm sure they care about everyone here.

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.750
Ah...

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.200
Huh?  It doesn't fit...

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:35.710
Let me.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.470
Sure...

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.520
Yeah!  Did it!

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:54.250
-On your face.
-There's dirt.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:04.960
Yahoo!  We're leading this race!

00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:08.660
Like playing a game!

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:11.110
Suneo, let me steer!

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.450
You can't handle this.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:14.860
What did you say!

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:15.780
Wait!

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.560
Stop complaining! Just let me!

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.700
Stop, it's dangerous!

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:22.570
In front!

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.160
-No!
-Mama!

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.490
Look out!

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:36.620
What happen!?

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.300
Al!

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:42.270
Commander Godat!

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:45.500
What's wrong!

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.330
This is...

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.220
A map!?

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.360
On the 3rd planet of that solar system,

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.310
Strong ether detected!

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.000
Espal wasn't just superstition?

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:07.000
I thought it was some lie too.

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.470
All hands ready to warp!

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.140
Sir!

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:17.160
Ouch...

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.540
We're saved.

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.360
That was close.

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:22.690
Al, you all right?

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:25.210
This can't be...

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.030
I shouldn't use that much power.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.730
Al!

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:32.980
Al!

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.680
Brother Luca!  Sister Luna!

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:39.550
We can't release that much power.

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.140
Sorry... I was...

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.680
He done nothing wrong!

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.560
He saved us from danger.

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:50.150
We are the one who steer.

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:51.840
That's not it.

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:55.930
It's because Al used too much power.

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:59.530
So far, we managed to conceal ourselves.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.850
Luca, are you guys...

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.130
Trying to run from someone?

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.490
From Kaguya-being.

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:09.960
Huh!

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.210
What?

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:14.480
1000 Years ago, Kaguya's military.

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:19.460
Used our power,
to develop weapon of mass destruction.

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:26.140
After that, to show their strength.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:29.320
Kaguya's moon is destroyed, but

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.580
Its broken pieces,
falling on planet Kaguya.

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:37.630
Causing tsunami and eruption.

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:41.360
The sky covered by smoke.

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.360
Without light, it became a world clouded with darkness.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.010
Over here!

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.260
Hurry!

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.470
Father and mother.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:56.040
Can't bear to see our power misuse by evil.

00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.800
They told us to flee on spaceship.

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.720
I want to be with you!

00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:09.390
Luca, please understand.

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:11.470
There's no other way.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.610
No, no!  I don't want!

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.610
Get on the ship now!

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:29.710
Luna!

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.760
Take care of...
Luca and everyone.

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.110
Yes

00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:39.200
Ah!

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:44.070
(Chanting prophecy)

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:46.050
Aa...  Ah...

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.810
Arrest them, at once!

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.310
Mozo, depart now!
no need to concern us!

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.640
Leave it to me!

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.680
Stop!  Don't let them!

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.970
Forgive us!  Luca!

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:15.380
Unable to use solar energy,
Planet Kaguya should turn into wasteland.

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:17.680
To restore it.

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:20.970
They might still try to find us.

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.520
They're the one who destroyed the planet.

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.660
How selfish!

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.590
Some bad guys will pursue us!?

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.620
I didn't sign up for this!

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:33.900
Chill, that was 1000 years ago.

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:37.020
I didn't mean to make everyone concern,

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.200
Anyhow, we have to get back to colony!

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:02.590
Beautiful...
just like how Planet Kaguya once.

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:06.970
It's bright and full of resources!

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.530
Let's report to Emperor Diabolo.

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:14.490
Wait, capturing Espal comes first.

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:15.960
But sir!

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:22.200
Turns out, they're still chasing us.

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:29.040
White long ear, like on the myth.

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:30.320
A child?

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:32.230
Don't let your eyes deceive you.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:35.820
They have lived for more than 1000 years.

00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:38.460
All hands prepare for battle!

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:41.800
Ready to land! Capture our Espal alive!

00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:43.080
Sir!

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:45.560
Use countermeasure against Ether.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.640
Head to the colony!

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.800
Brother Luca!   Sister Luna!

00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.190
What happened!?

00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.940
Everything okay?

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:01.380
This is bad!

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:02.890
Don't come here!

00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:17.870
Don't use live ammunition,
set to paralyze!

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:19.560
I won't let you!

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:23.200
Watch out!  Fire!

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:36.520
Aim at her!

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:39.580
Amazing!

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.280
Ether power...

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:43.740
I said countermeasure against ether!

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.830
Start Ether-distortion!

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.250
Shoot!

01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:05.290
What is that!?

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.570
Dust particle?

01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:13.930
-Luna!
-Luna!

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:17.210
-Al!
-Hang on!

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.250
I can't use... ether energy...

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.190
What!?

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.940
Without ether they're harmless.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.670
Capture them to our ship!

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.760
Sir!

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.400
Get on Space Cart!

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.980
What about other Espal?

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.030
We'll save them later.

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:43.920
Huh!?

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:46.760
Pursue! Don't let them escape!

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.320
Luca, hang on!

01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:55.790
They're here!

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:02.490
Take this!

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.630
Al!

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.050
Wa...!

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.410
Ha...?

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.860
Please leave!

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.080
Got you!

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:29.800
Luna!

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.520
Argh!

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.320
Turn back Doraemon!

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:34.950
The problem is...

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:37.410
The handle is not responding!

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.950
Ah... Luca!

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.940
No! we'll be captured!

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.520
Hey! don't interfere!

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:50.580
Nobita, can we reach that moon entrance?

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.320
You mean anywhere door?

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.570
I see, we can escape to earth.

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:56.570
Yes.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.310
Crub & Cansir!

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.450
Yes?

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.060
Every Espal captured?

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.080
Only 1 left!

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:10.750
Good grief, that turtle gave me a bad day.

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:14.600
I should've join that race.

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:16.490
What?

01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:22.160
No...!

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:27.960
Run to the door!

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.260
Hurry!

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.580
To Nobita's room!

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.300
Luca!

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.170
I have to stay.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.310
I can't leave them behind.

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.880
I'll stay too!  We're friends, right?.

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:50.860
All the more reason.

01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:52.220
You can't run!

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.140
Luca!

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:56.970
Ah!

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:00.110
Reckless!

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:03.190
What if you hit the Espal!

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.960
I just!

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:06.650
Ugh... Kh!

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.000
We finally meet.

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.380
It's futile, you have nowhere to run.

01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:25.170
Ah...

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:31.090
What are you looking at?

01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:32.010
Ha?

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:34.400
Anyone left in this dark plain?

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.110
Ah

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:41.480
They can't see anything the badge materialize.

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:52.460
Door access to the moon got cut off.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.660
No way!  You mean we can't go back!?

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:57.330
Argh...!

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.870
Is that it! We're the only one to survive.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.510
It can't be helped.

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.400
We didn't expect this to happen.

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:08.960
Aren't you frustated about this!?

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.660
I am...

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:13.950
Realizing I can't do anything!

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.620
Luca decided to stay,

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:18.530
For the sake of others...

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:21.570
Let's use Bamboo Copter to fly!

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.370
That's absurd!

01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:26.640
Moon is 380.000 km away!

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:29.240
Moon is farther than it looks.

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:30.940
No way...

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.900
Ugh... Aa!

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.620
Mozo!

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:39.050
There's a way to the moon.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:43.070
When Luca visit earth before,
he use a spaceship.

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.050
What!?

01:04:45.290 --> 01:04:48.460
This is... the place where I first met Luca.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.140
I'm certain it's under this tree.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.080
(Chanting)

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.710
-Whoa!
-It is a spaceship!

01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:08.220
It's so small, you sure we will fit?

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.460
Well this is actually a lifeboat
from that big spaceship.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.980
Let's modify it, this will take some time.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.570
Adding some 22-Century gadgets will suffice.

01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:22.670
Everyone go home and prepare!

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.390
Gather here again at 7 PM.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.380
Yes!

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:29.190
But this journey will be dangerous,

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:33.210
If your heart is not ready, better stay on earth.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:29.020
It's almost time,
we should depart.

01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:32.760
Wait for a bit, Suneo is still...

01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:34.290
Hey!

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.000
Took time fixing my bangs.

01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:45.630
Dummy, you're too slow!

01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:47.610
Stop it!

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.950
Then, time to depart!

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:57.300
Nobita, it's the moon.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.240
Whoa...

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.380
Hurry get inside!

01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:22.280
You should told us before!

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.840
Each light represent someone's livelihood.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.550
Withstand Environment!

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.450
We are going at high speed,
once we enter space.

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:01.430
It'll take a whole day to reach moon.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.470
So get inside and take some rest.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.520
The inside is spacious
and there's room for everyone.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.090
Yeah!

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:16.520
Bouncy!

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.540
I don't think there's a bath...

01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.080
There is!

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:23.230
Really!?

01:09:26.610 --> 01:09:29.880
earth as scenery, what a luxury...

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:35.190
Wait for us, Luca.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.170
Luca!

01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:43.690
Al!

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.340
Luna!

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.820
It seems they were taken to Kaguya...

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.200
Can't be.

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:58.230
NObit!

01:10:01.450 --> 01:10:03.470
He tried to tell us something.

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:05.260
Follow him.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.640
Hm... Ah.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:15.090
Luna!  You're okay!

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.200
Everyone!

01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:18.700
Ah, take it easy.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.900
Luca attached his badge to me.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.020
I was able to run here.

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:27.630
I see!  Without the badge they're,

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.510
unable to see the Rabbit Kingdom.

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:32.580
He sacrifice himself for me...

01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:35.060
always reckless.

01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:38.260
Those Kaguya-being is unforgivable!

01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:41.390
We will save Luca and everyone!

01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:43.720
Doctor's Bag.

01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:47.150
Shizuka stay here, and treat Luna injury.

01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:48.330
Understand.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.780
Bee Aware Alarm and Spare Pocket!

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.690
If something were to happen in Kaguya,

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.660
This alarm will notify you.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.020
This Spare Pocket connected to mine

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.570
I leave it here for emergency.

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:11.630
Rice cake! Thanks NObit.

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:16.550
Luna!  We'll be back!

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.310
Counting on you!

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.050
Careful!

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.670
According to Mozo information,

01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:27.790
Kaguya is 40 light year away.

01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:30.490
Even speed of light,
will take 40 years.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.600
What!

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:34.190
We can't take this leisurely!

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.700
We'll be an old man by then.

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:41.440
earthling didn't know warp navigation?

01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:45.180
Using warp will take instant to reach Kaguya.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:49.010
Press both steering lever simultaneously.

01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:52.320
Let's do it!  Warp!

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:05.320
Emperor Diabolo.

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:07.930
We have captured all Espal.

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.120
Here is their leader.

01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:13.890
Splendid achievement!

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.230
Your unit did a good job.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.830
My lord!

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:23.000
Ether is the way to restore Kaguya.

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:25.170
Not anymore.

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:30.730
You found something else beside Espal, right?

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:32.630
Something else?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.050
That planet is beautiful.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.530
Just like Kaguya once.

01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:40.370
Ah!

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:46.570
Taraba!

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.350
Espal will resurrect the weapon of mass destruction.

01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:55.560
Then, it'll be easy to obtain that planet.

01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:58.770
That planet...  You mean earth!?

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.040
Remain silent.

01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:06.140
earth huh? that planet known as.

01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:11.190
Aren't we supposed to use Espal
to restore light on planet Kaguya?

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:14.030
This planet is already beyond saving.

01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:17.340
We'll invade earth!

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.190
Prepare to resurrect the weapon!

01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:23.080
Labor every Espal for this cause!

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.570
Right

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.110
From today onward,
Taraba is the commander!

01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:37.150
You can't order me around anymore!

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.320
-Run away
-Ha?

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:42.410
Did you hear me, Godat...

01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.920
Why?

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.320
Espal wasn't meant to be used as weapon!

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:02.890
Go!

01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:09.920
Emperor's soldier.

01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:14.300
Over here!

01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:25.070
Are you a fool godat?,
befriended with that demon.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.400
You're disgracing yourself!

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.360
Abandon Kaguya's future
and dragged other planet into this!

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.990
Silent!

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.470
Aaagh!

01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:46.540
We should eat Gummy Translation now.

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:50.470
Or we won't understand Kaguya's language.

01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:51.760
Arriving!

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.210
We will distribute food rations, form a line!

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.100
Over here!

01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:20.540
Mine too!

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:25.030
-It's cold!
-Stay beside mom.

01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:28.910
We work harshly only for this.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.000
It's getting smaller.

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.190
Luca was right.

01:15:33.230 --> 01:15:36.130
This place lacks food and energy.

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:39.790
At any rate, we have to find Luca and others.

01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:41.820
Mozo, guide us.

01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:44.910
I was here 1000 years ago.

01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:46.900
I don't know the geography now.

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.630
Please know it!

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:51.100
All right! I'll ask around.

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:52.090
Ah, wait.

01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:57.120
Hey, do you know where Espal is?

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.620
Of course not! They're just myth.

01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:05.600
Really now... I think they really do exist.

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:08.810
If they do, they're probably normal people.

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:11.610
I think Emperor Diabolo mistaken about Espal.

01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:13.170
Diabolo?

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.080
Mistaken or not

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.640
No one can deny an absolute ruler for 1000 years.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.380
Even if we're not living in this wasteland.

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:25.320
He'll just turn it into one by war.

01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:28.390
Quiet, they'll put you in jail.

01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:33.120
Who cares! Here or jail there's no difference.

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:37.720
If only sir Godat the one to govern our planet...

01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:42.720
Sir Godat, treat everyone kindly.

01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:46.440
He'll surely be a great leader.

01:16:46.710 --> 01:16:50.730
Great leader or not, all important people lives there.

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:53.140
Dia Palace.

01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:03.300
Ah!

01:17:05.150 --> 01:17:06.450
Jail cell?

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.540
At least, you know how it feels to be captured.

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:11.980
Forgive me.

01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:15.900
I just meant to lend your power to save Kaguya.

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.000
Serves me right...

01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:22.720
We'll just be use,
to start another conflict!

01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:24.940
You should have realize.

01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:31.230
It's not like we're asked to be made this way...

01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.760
Even father and mother,

01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:37.230
might have regret ever created us.

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:39.780
Brother Luca...

01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:42.010
That's not it!

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:47.840
My ancestor was proud able to created you.

01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:50.140
Hmm... Ah!

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:56.380
Sometimes we could
heard someone's mind.

01:17:57.710 --> 01:17:59.280
I see...

01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:04.780
Huh!

01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:13.180
I inherit this form my ancestors.

01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:18.690
Ha...

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:20.400
Come here.

01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:27.250
Ha...

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.890
You know father and mother!?

01:18:31.090 --> 01:18:33.520
I'm Dr.Godal descendants.

01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:37.590
My ancestors has someting to say to you.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.600
"Did we leave doubt in your heart?, If we could,"

01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:44.670
"we want to go back and able to raise you again."

01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:47.940
"Espal is none other than our loving children."

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:51.870
Father... Mother...

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.300
If you're fine, you could have this.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.100
Is it okay?

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.730
I'm sure they'll be pleased.

01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:10.700
If I may, I liked to hear the prophecy.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:11.930
The prophecy!?

01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:22.810
Where do we go?, there's no entrance.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.410
If only we could use Luca's ability.

01:19:26.530 --> 01:19:30.470
Doraemon, don't you have gadgets to make us psychic?

01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:33.660
Hm... I do have one...

01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:36.120
Psychic Hat!

01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:40.290
With this hat, you can perform 3 psychic abilities.

01:19:40.770 --> 01:19:41.970
X-ray

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:43.160
Telekinesis.

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.970
Teleportation.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:48.520
Cool! Let me try it.

01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:52.190
Sure, without practice it'll be hard.

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:54.810
Yes!   X-ray first.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.270
Show me... Show me... The entrance...

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:06.040
Like I said, today we should celebrate.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.530
I doubt commander will come...

01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:10.860
I'll persuade him to join us.

01:20:12.190 --> 01:20:13.590
Someone's here!

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.860
Hide!

01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:18.840
Anyway, commander is late.

01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:22.110
Show me...  Show me...

01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:24.610
-Nobita!
-That lunatic!

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.870
Entrance... Show yourself...

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.170
I see it!   What?

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:32.670
Don't move.

01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:36.760
This guy was with Espal!

01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:38.810
How did you come here!

01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:41.580
Te-te...  Telekinesis!

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.640
T-t... time out!

01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:49.070
Is this guy a broken Espal?

01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:51.640
This time... Go!

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.650
Hm? Aa!

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:56.250
What's he doing...

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.450
I had it!

01:20:57.490 --> 01:20:59.450
Taking us for a fool!

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.400
Te-teleportation!

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.440
Huh?  What!?

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:11.640
Hm...?

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.060
Oh no!

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.590
Huh?  He's gone.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:23.230
Yeah! I found the entrance!

01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:27.880
It turns out okay.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.230
Owie...

01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:40.360
This way!

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.250
You sure?

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.940
You'll be sorry, if this wrong!

01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:49.570
Some uninvited pest.

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.130
Run!

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.020
Now!

01:21:58.090 --> 01:21:58.940
Yes!

01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:03.320
Did it!

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.950
Horizon Tape trap, succeed!

01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:08.520
-How is it?
-Good?

01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:10.640
Everyone!

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.440
We're here to save you.

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.200
Gian!

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.090
Don't cry, good job to endure!

01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:20.450
Nobita!

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:23.430
I can't believe you came!

01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:26.370
Of course, we're friend.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.710
Luca!

01:22:27.810 --> 01:22:30.510
I'm the one who guide them!

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.540
What an attitude.

01:22:33.230 --> 01:22:34.770
Espal's comrade?

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:39.280
Kaguya-being that attacked us!

01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:40.700
Wait!

01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:43.600
Godat was deceive by Diabolo!

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:48.270
He's descendants of father and mother
and our ally!

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:49.880
This guy...

01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:56.960
1000 time will pass, with comrade we shall return.

01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:03.290
1000 rabbit will pour, the land shall restore its light.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.340
Because of this prophecy.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:08.080
I was searching for Espal endlessly.

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:10.580
Do you know what it means?

01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:13.520
Even Al doesn't understand it.

01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:15.840
What is this 1000 rabbit?

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:17.390
Espal I think.

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:19.670
There are only 11 of them.

01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:23.000
If this "comrade" refers to you...

01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:25.120
What we have here?

01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.520
Hey Bolo!

01:23:29.650 --> 01:23:32.410
We came faraway from earth!

01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:34.290
Show yourself!

01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:36.830
I see...

01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:40.340
You people are earthling huh...

01:23:40.670 --> 01:23:43.960
How tricky, able to rescue some Espal.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.320
You hippo!

01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:46.810
That wasn't his true form.

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:50.130
Diabolo, is always behind curtain.

01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:57.780
I'm going to defeat Diabolo!

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.360
As long as he's around,
Kaguya won't have any future!

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.160
In that case, I'll go too.

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:04.810
Because

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:08.240
Father and mother cherished this planet.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.900
That means, we're coming too.

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:19.090
Al, you help other Espal escape.

01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:20.150
Yes!

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:21.600
Go!

01:24:21.630 --> 01:24:22.640
Yeah!

01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:35.800
Amazing!

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.760
Reflect Mantle!

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.810
All right!

01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:48.800
Not bad Doraemon!

01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:50.020
Of course!

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.480
They keep coming...

01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:55.590
Me and Suneo will hold them!

01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:56.090
What!?

01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:57.590
You guys go ahead!

01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.240
Counting on you!

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.690
Shoot like crazy!

01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:02.040
Do or die!

01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:10.900
Diabolo is behind the curtain, stay alert!

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.640
I challenge you, come out!

01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:21.790
Impressive bravery Godat...

01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:24.670
Prepare to meet the afterlife.

01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:27.560
Face my true form!

01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:36.930
He's not...

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.890
Diabolo's not there

01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:58.160
I am Diabolo!

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.070
Only his head!?

01:26:00.170 --> 01:26:01.530
What is that mean!?

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.840
I rule with destruction.

01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:08.600
As the messenger of death!

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.800
I get it!  Diabolo identity is...

01:26:11.970 --> 01:26:15.020
A machine with artificial intelligent!

01:26:15.190 --> 01:26:18.280
Also, the weapon of mass destruction itself!

01:26:18.570 --> 01:26:20.720
True you are!

01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:24.320
As you may guess,
the thing that destroyed this planet moon,

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.660
Was my divine power!

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.840
How can this be!

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:33.310
We have been ruled by this thing
for over 1000 years.

01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:37.310
You have rob the planet,
from its people!

01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:40.620
How ridiculously naive!

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:44.490
Kayuga people themselves that created me.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:50.170
Their power of imagination
that lead to destruction!

01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:53.040
Espal power is the same!

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:55.230
You're wrong!

01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:59.790
Imagination is the future!
where people able to reach understanding.

01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:03.010
Without consideration for each other.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.730
Destruction is born!

01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:05.950
Silent!

01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:09.080
Ether power is my blood and body!

01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:13.050
Whoever tried to prevent my resurrection will take the consequences!

01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:25.210
Nobita!

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:26.590
Don't mind me!

01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:33.640
We're empty!

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:34.970
Darn it!

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.000
Take this!

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.000
Whoa!

01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:43.800
A robot!?

01:27:57.590 --> 01:28:02.050
Doraemon's gadget working well,
her injury healed gradually.

01:28:05.190 --> 01:28:07.950
NObit, what are you working on?

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:16.180
This badge is quiet unique.

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:21.680
Just by removing it,
the kingdom and NObit.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.550
Become invisible...

01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:25.740
Hm... What!?

01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:27.430
NObit!

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:30.840
How could you materialize!?

01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:34.520
That badge...

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:39.960
NObit, try to remove that.

01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:46.920
Reverse effect...

01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:50.370
What!?

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.750
Shizuka!

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:54.990
They're in trouble!

01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:58.680
Oh no! But what can we do...

01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:11.560
You should be honored.

01:29:11.730 --> 01:29:16.330
I'll dissolve your body and become part of me.

01:29:16.450 --> 01:29:17.870
Dissolve!?

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.120
No..

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:26.670
You gotta be kidding me!

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:29.090
I don't want to be part of machine!

01:29:29.170 --> 01:29:31.400
Where are the Espal!?

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.930
Espal?

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:37.150
All of them is present here.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.170
As part of my blood and body...

01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:53.020
Luca!

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:54.490
Al!

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.090
1000 years I've waited for this

01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:02.140
He's looks younger!

01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:05.260
He absorb Luca and others ether.

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:07.130
We have to stop him.

01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:09.930
My pocket is gone!

01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:13.230
Is this what you're looking for?

01:30:16.150 --> 01:30:17.380
When did you!

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:20.680
Before departing, anything left to say?

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.920
Someday Kaguya people will stand against you!

01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:28.090
How humiliating to lose to another machine!

01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:30.820
I want to turn you into junk!

01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:33.930
I haven't finished Lion Masked comic.

01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:35.160
Mama!

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:37.550
Your time is up.

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:40.260
Do it!

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.320
Aa...!

01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:50.240
Doraemon, do something!

01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.270
There's nothing I can do!

01:30:52.330 --> 01:30:54.370
We're done for!

01:30:54.730 --> 01:30:58.330
Deliver these rebel to their end!

01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:01.020
Luca!

01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:03.280
1000 time will pass,

01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:07.670
with comrade we shall return.

01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:10.380
Wh-what is this voice?

01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.930
1000 rabbit will pour,

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:17.920
the land shall restore its light!

01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:19.080
Al!

01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:20.400
The prophecy!

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:22.440
Huh!?

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.810
Moonbit!?

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.320
Everyone we come to save you!

01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:07.000
Shizuka!

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:08.110
Luna!

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.630
How could they materialize?

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.480
This Myth Badge!

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.660
Able to enter our real world.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.030
From that theory world?

01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:19.850
-Yes!
-That's why

01:32:20.110 --> 01:32:22.070
Moonbit and others will fight!

01:33:00.170 --> 01:33:02.460
Hm...

01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:04.420
Ha!

01:33:13.290 --> 01:33:14.250
Luca!

01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:15.960
Luna!

01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:20.160
What are you soldiers doing!
Use Ether-distortion...

01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:27.350
Why you...!

01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:29.040
Amazing!

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:31.370
If only I have my pocket...

01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:33.450
Your pocket is here!

01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:35.180
Mozo!

01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:37.670
I won't let you!

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:41.420
The speed of my feet is...

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.850
Well known!

01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:44.260
taking these too!

01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.740
Begin counterattack!

01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:51.040
Yeah!

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.330
Reflect Mantle!

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:57.960
Boom!

01:33:59.210 --> 01:34:00.270
Hop!

01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:04.090
Here!

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.910
Stuck Magnet!

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.040
Stuck and suck everything.

01:34:12.170 --> 01:34:13.320
Gian!

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.600
Al!

01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:16.140
Let's do it!

01:34:16.170 --> 01:34:16.840
Yes!

01:34:17.010 --> 01:34:18.070
Ready!

01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:28.650
Stand!

01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:49.480
At least, I've got to get one of them!

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:53.490
Boom!

01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:54.810
Aa!

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.440
No!

01:34:58.530 --> 01:34:59.450
Luna!

01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:02.190
Aa...!

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:03.700
Luna!

01:35:03.930 --> 01:35:07.130
Let everyone else fight here,
we pursue them!

01:35:07.150 --> 01:35:08.230
Yes!

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:10.790
Counting on you!

01:35:15.370 --> 01:35:16.760
Dia palace is...

01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:29.720
What's going on?

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.090
What!?

01:35:54.370 --> 01:35:56.460
Weapon of mass destruction...

01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.860
Luna is inside!

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.060
Nothing to do on Kaguya anymore.

01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:06.220
I'll rule that planet next.

01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:07.560
That planet?

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:08.990
It's the earth.

01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:10.190
What!

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:11.660
Not on my watch!

01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:12.870
Luna!

01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:17.860
Our copter can't chase him.

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.460
Once he passed the cloud, it'll be the end

01:36:23.530 --> 01:36:25.470
Do something Doraemon!

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.340
I'm trying here!

01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:31.080
Farewell foolish people!

01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:33.930
Why can't I move!?

01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.480
Ether light...

01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:42.990
Everyone!

01:36:43.530 --> 01:36:45.910
Impudent!

01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:49.280
Perish along with this planet!

01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:53.500
Aa...!

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.090
Luna!

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.280
Okay!

01:36:57.250 --> 01:37:01.680
The power won't be enough,
we need something...

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:07.150
My shell is the hardest in universe,

01:37:07.150 --> 01:37:08.650
get it?

01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:10.590
Ah!

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:22.760
Begone!

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.640
Luna!

01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:46.330
What with this light!?

01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:47.550
I see him!

01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:49.150
Luca power boost!

01:37:49.290 --> 01:37:49.970
Yes!

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.890
Here goes!

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:55.840
Boom!

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.950
Kame...h!

01:38:08.150 --> 01:38:09.870
We did it!

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:13.170
There's no way I lose...

01:38:13.210 --> 01:38:16.160
To a mere human...

01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:26.680
Luna!

01:38:28.330 --> 01:38:29.710
Luna!

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.840
Luna...

01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.980
Suneo!

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:36.520
I believe... I can't fly.

01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:40.950
Rabbit is pretty good too...

01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:16.250
The light is restored.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.170
What was that explosion?

01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:27.760
It's similar to Sparkling Moss.

01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:29.440
Let's see?

01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:31.770
You're right!

01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:35.240
Not our moss, but a similar plant.

01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:37.290
When in contact with ether,

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:39.640
It's explode then multiplied!

01:39:40.110 --> 01:39:41.870
Why put it here?

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.950
I guess they prepared it.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:50.920
Dr. Godal believed you guys
will return in 1000 years.

01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:53.880
So they already prepared it.

01:39:54.650 --> 01:39:57.560
For the time when
Kaguya restored its light.

01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.540
They prepared...

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.350
Just like how your snack is prepared.

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.160
What?

01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:10.890
Luca.

01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:13.770
If you like,

01:40:14.230 --> 01:40:16.800
You could live with us on Kaguya.

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:17.680
What!?

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:25.500
Thank you but,

01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:29.290
It's better for us to stay as myth.

01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:30.340
Huh!?

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:32.390
What...Hmm.

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:33.500
Understood.

01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:37.290
What about the people who already seen Espal?

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:40.170
Commander!

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:42.460
We're looking for you!

01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:45.250
What happened?

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.420
I got an idea!

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.990
Soldiers! come here please.

01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:56.630
Forgotten Scent!

01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:57.590
Here!

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:03.760
Turns out Espal from the myth,
is just normal being.

01:41:03.810 --> 01:41:05.270
Yes!

01:41:05.290 --> 01:41:07.930
Espal is just normal being.

01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:11.100
Use the smell from this weed,

01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:14.050
to erase Espal from everyone's memory.

01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:17.070
I see... Then I should.

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:17.900
Wait!

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.950
Only you, please remember us.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.320
So that someday...

01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:28.650
You could showed us a prosper Kaguya.

01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:34.010
I thank you.

01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:37.920
I accept your trust in kind.

01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:39.310
Also.

01:41:39.930 --> 01:41:41.240
Our friendship.

01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:51.680
You know...

01:41:51.810 --> 01:41:54.460
NObit created these reverse badge.

01:41:55.770 --> 01:42:00.050
From the theory world
to become a myth that exist.

01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:02.610
Maybe NObit is genius?

01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:05.360
He's similar to me on that one.

01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:08.190
But you know...

01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:11.560
Too crowded!

01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:17.210
I have a request.

01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:18.830
Request?

01:42:19.130 --> 01:42:21.410
Create theory about planet kaguya,

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.400
where Espal creature existence,

01:42:24.690 --> 01:42:27.210
Is just another human being.

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.410
Without special power and could get old,
then die normally.

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:34.230
That's what we wished to become!

01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:38.100
Please make this theory about us
come true!

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.520
What!?

01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:42.030
Are you guys fine without special powers?

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.710
Even though you could live forever!

01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:46.820
But why?

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.900
Without them,
we'll push ourselves to do our best.

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:52.670
and able to appreciate how wonderful life is.

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:56.420
I realize that, after meeting you guys.

01:42:57.390 --> 01:42:59.480
With moonbit and others,

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.050
In this kingdom on the back moon.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.040
We want to build a world to live on.

01:43:06.650 --> 01:43:09.060
-Doraemon.
-Yes.

01:43:09.670 --> 01:43:11.780
Everyone ready?

01:43:12.410 --> 01:43:16.120
Yes

01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:20.070
Espal the creature from myth ...

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:23.680
Are normal being like us.

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.210
Thank you.

01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:47.440
I'm happy for you.

01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:49.690
-Nobita.
-Yes?

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:53.240
In order to protect their peaceful life.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.620
It's better if nobody could found them.

01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:58.880
What do you mean?

01:43:59.070 --> 01:44:01.080
Our club ends here!

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.910
We should let go of our badge.

01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:06.570
What!?

01:44:06.650 --> 01:44:08.310
We can't meet them anymore?

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.650
No way!

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:23.060
Proceed with your singing practice.

01:44:26.050 --> 01:44:26.970
Yes!

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:29.890
I won't forget about you, Suneo.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.240
Me too!

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.270
So long, Nobit.

01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:40.590
I'll be here for them, no need to worry!

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:43.930
Nobita.

01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:46.170
Luca.

01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:50.100
We had fun...

01:44:51.210 --> 01:44:54.540
Thanks for letting me,
be your friend.

01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.970
I'll be here, watching you.

01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:02.280
No need to exaggerate.

01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:06.060
Even without badge,
we'll always be able to meet.

01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:10.690
We have imagination power on our side.

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:12.320
Ah...

01:45:13.670 --> 01:45:14.660
Right!

01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:18.240
-Luna!
-Farewell!

01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:20.910
-Bye
-So long!

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:23.400
Goodbye!

01:45:25.690 --> 01:45:28.260
Someday earth and moon.

01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:31.550
Will be connected, until then.

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.500
Farewell!

01:45:46.570 --> 01:45:51.500
A few days ago, transmission from lunar rover Nayotake that suddenly cut off.

01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:53.470
Has miraculously restored.

01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:54.880
Nobita.

01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:58.100
Ah? Is he out already?

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.080
Here...

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:12.170
...and there.

01:46:15.090 --> 01:46:16.160
Huh?

01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:18.110
Whoa...
